      "Authorities have released body camera footage from outside the home of Gene Hackman, where the actor and his wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead in late February",
      "ALBUQUERQE, N.M. -- Authorities have released body camera footage from outside the home of Gene Hackman, where the actor and wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead in late February.",
      "The redacted footage shows deputies talking with the two workers who called authorities to report seeing someone lying on the floor inside the home. With no signs of forced entry or other evidence of suspicious circumstances, the deputies asked about the possibility of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning, and the workers said they didn\u2019t see how that could have been the case.",
      "\u201cSomething\u2019s not right,\u201d one of the workers said.",
      "Authorities soon determined there were no leaks that could have been fatal, further fueling a mystery that captured the public\u2019s attention.",
      "It was solved about a week later when medical investigators confirmed that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s about a week after hantavirus pulmonary syndrome \u2014 a rare, rodent-borne disease \u2014 took the life of his wife.",
      "The Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office released only some of the footage from the investigation.",
      "A New Mexico court last week granted a temporary restraining order against the release of any photographs and video showing Hackman and his wife the inside of their home. Hackman\u2019s estate had filed the petition to withhold images, citing the need to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment.",
      "Workers who had maintained the property talked to investigators about respecting Hackman and Arawaka\u2019s privacy. One worker described Arawaka as a private person.",
      "The body camera footage also shows brief sightings of one of the couple\u2019s dogs running in the wooded hills on their property on the edge of Santa Fe. A man who identified himself to officers as a dog trainer who cared for the couple\u2019s pet dogs said the couple were \u201cnuts\u201d about their dogs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s toys everywhere around the property,\u201d he said.",
      "In a separate video, Arakawa\u2019s hairdresser told investigators that his client took the dogs with her everywhere and that the smallest one would often hang out inside the salon with them during her visits.",
      "That dog was found inside a crate, not far from Arakawa\u2019s body. A report obtained by The Associated Press from the state Department of Agriculture\u2019s veterinary lab states the dog likely died from dehydration and starvation.",
      "The actor\u2019s daughter, Elizabeth Hackman, told authorities she wanted the dog that died to be cremated. Authorities put her in touch with the local animal shelter to talk about the options.",

      "The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "With a budget above $250 million, \u201cSnow White\u201d had set out with higher ambitions, particularly since it returns Disney to its very origins. The 1937 original \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was the company\u2019s first animated feature, and paid for its Burbank studio lot.",
      "But this \u201cSnow White\u201d struggled to find anything like a fairy tale ending. The runup to release was plagued by controversies over the film\u2019s handling of the dwarfs, who are rendered in CGI, and backlashes over comments by its star, Rachel Zegler. The PR headaches prompted Disney to pull back on its premiere.",
      "Also working against the film, directed by Marc Webb: poor reviews. Critics were largely not impressed with Disney\u2019s latest live-action remake, with reviews coming in just 43% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "There\u2019s been a wide variance between the box-office performance of other \u201clive-action\u201d Disney remakes, but \u201cSnow White\u201d might mark a new nadir. Jon Favreau\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d (2019) didn\u2019t have great reviews, either, but grossed more than $1.6 billion worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d opened worse than \u201cDumbo\u201d (a $46 million opening in 2019) and well shy of \u201cCinderella\u201d territory ($67.9 million in 2015).",
      "Overseas, \u201cSnow White\u201d added $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million. But going into the weekend, \u201cSnow White\u201d had been eyeing a worldwide total closer to $100 million \u2013 and a few weeks back, expectations were significantly higher.",
      "The result will surely add to questions over Disney\u2019s long-term strategy of mining its vault for live-action remakes. In the pipeline are upcoming new versions of \u201cMoana\" and \u201cTangled.\" A live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d launches in May.",
      "Efforts to modernize \u201cSnow White,\" though, quickly ran afoul. In 2022, actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake plans as \u201cbackward.\u201d Disney ultimately opted to drop \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d from the original's title, and animate the dwarfs. Some right-wing commentators targeted \u201cSnow White\u201d and Zegler's casting as an overly \u201cwoke\u201d production. Delays and reshoots also ran up costs.",
      "Disney, though, has recently steered a handful of films from modest starts to enviable final hauls. The Barry Jenkins-directed \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d opened with $35.4 million domestically, but ultimately surpassed $717 million worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d will face little direct competition in the coming weeks. Audiences gave it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cAlto Knights,\u201d a period gangster film starring Robert De Niro in both lead roles, was a total misfire. The Barry Levinson-directed film, which cost about $45 million to make, opened with just $3.2 million from 2,651 theaters. The flop of \u201cAlto Knights\u201d followed another misfire for Warner Bros. with Bong Joon Ho\u2019s big-budget sci-fi \u201cMickey 17.\u201d In three weeks, it\u2019s tallied $40.2 million domestically against a $118 million budget.",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d starring Jonathan Majors as a disturbed aspiring bodybuilder, opened with $700,000 for Briarcliff Entertainment in 815 locations. The film was dropped by Searchlight Pictures after Majors was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of assault and harassment against Grace Jabbari, his ex-girlfriend. Majors avoided jail time but was given a year of probation.",
      "The disappointment-filled weekend added to a rough 2025 so far for Hollywood. The box office is down 6.9% from last year, according to data firm Comscore, and 38.6% from 2019.",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",

      "The announcement came nearly three years after a judge rejected similar charges against Guillod in Santa Barbara County.",
      "An email seeking comment from an attorney who has represented Guillod was not immediately answered. Guillod has denied all of the allegations.",
      "Guillod, a talent manager and producer whose credits include 2017's \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d and 2020's \u201cExtraction,\u201d was originally arrested in 2020 and charged with rape and sexual assault involving six women between 2014 and 2020 in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties. Authorities chose to try the cases jointly in Santa Barbara County, where a judge at a 2022 preliminary hearing found that there was insufficient evidence for Guillod to go to trial on charges involving four of the women.",
      "The judge found there was enough evidence to go forward with charges that he had assaulted an actor in 2012 and a waitress in 2018, but because those were both in LA County, Santa Barbara prosecutors no longer had jurisdiction and sent the cases to the Los Angeles District Attorney.",
      "\u201cThe allegations involve deeply troubling and concerning behavior, and we empathize with the pain and trauma the accusers have experienced throughout this long investigative process,\u201d Hochman's statement said.",
      "Hochman's office also recently declined to file charges against Marilyn Manson after another yearslong investigation.",
      "Guillod had been among the people investigated by a task force formed by former District Attorney Jackie Lacey in 2017 to investigate sexual misconduct in Hollywood when the #MeToo movement gained national attention. The vast majority of cases they considered did not lead to charges.",
      "An exception was movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of rape and sexual assault in Los Angeles in 2022. He is appealing the convictions.",

      "WASHINGTON -- On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O\u2019Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O\u2019Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January, about three weeks before President Donald Trump upended the Kennedy Center by ousting longtime president Deborah Rutter and board chairman David Rubenstein. Trump dismissed the board of trustees and replaced them with loyalists, who then elected him as chairman.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 and also Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \u201cworried about what the future might bring.\u201d",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\u201cTwain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cTwain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\u201d",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin in the Free World.\u201d",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cI think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\u201d comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\u201d",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \u201cthe Roy Cohn Pavilion\u201d after one of Trump\u2019s mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted on social media that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\u201d",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has never been particularly political. The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times. In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O\u2019Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O\u2019Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O\u2019Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows. He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \u201cHamilton\u201d and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Leftist comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \u201cAll You Fascists Bound to Lose.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The new Paramount+ series \u201cHappy Face\u201d has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row. But perhaps the most intriguing part? How it examines the warping nature of true crime itself.",
      "\u201cI was less interested in the specific psychology of a serial killer or glorifying the murders or seeing violence against women on screen,\" says Jennifer Cacicio, executive producer and showrunner. \"I just feel like we\u2019ve seen that. I was very interested in making a true-crime show told through a different lens.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Face,\u201d which begins airing Thursday, is inspired by the true story of Melissa Moore, whose father was a prolific serial killer infamous for drawing smiley faces on letters to the media and prosecutors. She was just 15 when he was captured.",
      "Decades later, as an adult with her own children, she finds herself drawn back into his orbit as she sets out to save an innocent man for a crime her father committed. She also has to tell her daughter the truth about her grandfather.",
      "Starring Annaleigh Ashford and Dennis Quaid, \u201cHappy Face\u201d is told from a female point of view and looks at how a shameful secret can echo through generations. It's also about the push and pull of infamy, with horrendous crimes somehow remaining an alluring draw.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crime dramas out there that I think are very male-centric. It\u2019s either about the cops are the cool guys or the criminals are the cool guys, and it\u2019s all about kicking in doors. I\u2019ve written on those shows and they\u2019re fun and they serve a purpose. And I think that I really wanted to try something different,\u201d Cacicio says.",
      "\u201cWhat is it like for the rest of the family when there\u2019s this shameful secret and this series of crimes and these acts of violence and what are the ripple effects on everybody involved?\u201d",
      "Ashford, who earned a Tony Award nomination playing a serial killer on Broadway in \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d plays Moore with tenderness and anger, saying she was interested in exploring generational trauma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst nightmares,\u201d she says. \u201cThe worst nightmare of all is having a family member be a victim. And then the second worst nightmare is having a family member be the perpetrator. So what would you do if you\u2019re a parent or your sibling or your spouse or your child committed an atrocity?\u201d",
      "Moore previously shared her story in the bestselling memoir, \u201cShattered Silence\u201d and the 2018 \"Happy Face\" podcast, reaching out to her father's victims and advocating for other family members of killers. Cacicio was one of a number of writers interested in telling her story for TV.",
      "Cacicio approached Moore with this pitch: \u201cIf you want someone who\u2019s a straight-up journalist, who\u2019s just going to tell exactly the story of the podcast, you should let someone else do it,\u201d she told her. \u201cThere\u2019s also an opportunity for it to be a bigger story that\u2019s asking some questions about true crime.\u201d",
      "Cacicio and Moore, it turned out had plenty in common. They were the same age, and both the oldest of three kids. Both had close relationships with their fathers, who hid other lives \u2014 Moore's was a killer and Cacicio served time in prison for drug dealing.",
      "\u201cObviously, the crimes are different, the circumstances are different. But I think, in my family, it was something we didn\u2019t talk about and it was something I didn\u2019t want my friends to know,\u201d says Cacicio.",
      "\u201cA lot of it was really personal to me. And I think that\u2019s what made her trust me \u2014 that I really understood the feelings, even if I didn\u2019t necessarily understand the specific circumstances.\u201d",
      "Quaid plays Moore's father, but unlike other roles he's taken that involve a living person, he had no intention of meeting the prisoner. He didn't want to glorify the killer but also \u201cHappy Face\u201d isn't that kind of show.",
      "\u201cThis is told from Melissa\u2019s point of view, and I think it\u2019s actually truer than his point of view, because I think she knows him much better than he knows himself,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he shows emotions like a little boy who\u2019s trying to talk himself out of a whipping.\u201d",
      "Cacicio says it's time we took a look at the explosion in popularity of true crime, in which women are often the victims but women are also the chief consumers.",
      "\u201cAre we obsessed with these stories because we\u2019re trying to protect ourselves in case the worst happens?\u201d she asks. \u201cI read somewhere that it\u2019s an act of normalizing your own experiences, because usually it\u2019s whatever you\u2019re watching is worse than what\u2019s happened to you. So it kind of like makes you feel better about your own traumas.\u201d",

      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial holiday hit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d from other songwriters",
      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\" from other songwriters.",
      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \u201cdisappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \u201c'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\u201d",
      "They said there was an \u201coverwhelming likelihood\u201d Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \u201cmade no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\u201d",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row \u2014 measuring the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",

      "NEW YORK -- Just cue up the first song from the new album by The Doobie Brothers and you'll hear something unusual: harmony, in a new way.",
      "It's not just that soulful blast from Michael McDonald, marking his first time recording with the band in 45 years. Listen and you'll also hear founding member Pat Simmons and original vocalist Tom Johnston.",
      "\u201cWalk This Road\u201d \u2014 with the always-welcome addition of Mavis Staples \u2014 is a horn-and-slide-guitar slice of bluesy, wailing rock that's also a celebration of a band that has endured changes and re-formed with members now in their 70s.",
      "\u201cSomehow, here we are,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends throughout the years. Our kids have all grown up together and our kids have kind of kept us in contact even at times when we might have dropped off the radar for each other.\u201d",
      "The Doobie Brothers, who formed in 1970 and initially broke up in 1982, have a packed 2025 planned: A European tour that leads to a North American one, the strong new album and inclusion in the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us ever even really thought we\u2019d still be on stage at this age doing this, much less together,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cThat we\u2019re still able to express ourselves artistically is something that\u2019s not lost on us.\u201d",
      "The North American tour kicks off in Detroit on Aug. 4 and heads to such cities as New York, Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Toronto. The opening act will be The Coral Reefer Band.",
      "\u201cWalk This Road\u201d features 10 new songs sung by McDonald, Simmons and Johnston, who collaborated on writing the tracks and play on each other's tunes. Longtime collaborator John McFee also returned for the project.",
      "The album, out June 6, has something for everyone \u2014 honky-tonk, driving country, flirty Southern pop, moody folk and melodic rock. There are songs about New Orleans and Hawaii. Angels make the lyrics on two songs.",
      "\u201cOne of the strengths of our live show was the fact that you couldn\u2019t get bored with any one style of music because everything was kind of a different bag,\u201d says McDonald, who officially reunited with the band on tour in 2019. \u201cWe like to do that. You know, I think this album is hopefully no different in that respect.\u201d",
      "John Shanks, who produced the band's 2021 album \u201cLibert\u00e9,\u201d returned for \u201cWalk This Road,\u201d lending them his Los Angeles studio, with a writing room upstairs and a recording booth downstairs where each songwriter took turns cutting tracks.",
      "\u201cThe band, I think, presents all of us with an opportunity to do things that we might not do just as individual songwriters,\u201d says McDonald.",
      "While the Doobies have never been a concept band, the album explores seizing the moments, reflects on paths taken and coming to grips with the past.",
      "\u201cThis is a snapshot in time of where the band is and where the writers are,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cWe didn\u2019t consciously sit down and say, 'Well, we\u2019re going to try and do this.\u2019\u201d",
      "One track, \"Learn to Let Go,\" is an unrequited love song that's about letting go of things that hold you back, while \u201cSpeed of Pain\u201d is about how the worst things in life can become the best.",
      "\u201cIn many cases, it\u2019s just a situation where you have to lose it all. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I\u2019ve met over the years who have told me that going to jail was the best thing that ever happened to them,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cI think total defeat in this world is the great teacher.\u201d",
      "The Doobie Brothers are already members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 with tracks like \u201cTakin\u2019 It To the Streets,\u201d \u201cWhat a Fool Believes\u201d and \u201cMinute By Minute\u201d \u2014 but shortly after the album comes out, they'll be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really great for this band,\" says Johnston. \"I think it\u2019s great for us as individual writers, but I think it\u2019s also great for the group, and it kind of carries on the name, if you will.\u201d",
      "McDonald and Johnston both expressed a little surprise that they're still making music with the folks they worked with in their 20s and are still a draw on the road.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just fun to visit all these places musically. It\u2019s fun to put that out in front of the crowd live. And to do an album now \u2014 I didn\u2019t picture doing this, but I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Johnston says.",

      "Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through the new live-action \u201cSnow White.\u201d",
      "Mirror mirror on the wall, what\u2019s the fairest Disney live-action remake of them all?",
      "Wait, mirror. Hold on a second. Maybe choosing from the likes of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d (2010), \u201cMulan\u201d (2020) and \u201cThe Lion King\" (2019) isn\u2019t such a good idea. Mirror, on second thought, what\u2019s on Netflix?",
      "Even the most devoted fans would have to acknowledge that these have not been the most illustrious illustrations of Disney magic. At their best (\u201cPete\u2019s Dragon\u201d? \u201cCinderella\u201d?) they breathe life into old classics that could use a little updating. At their worst, well, blue Will Smith.",
      "Given the rapacious rate of remakes in modern Hollywood, it\u2019s remarkable that it\u2019s taken nearly 90 years for Disney to return to \u201cSnow White.\u201d It means going back to the very foundation of the Mouse House. The 1937 \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was Disney\u2019s first animated feature; its grosses paid for the studio\u2019s Burbank lot.",
      "That legacy of \u201cSnow White,\u201d by comparison, doesn\u2019t do any favors to Marc Webb\u2019s inevitably lesser, inert live-action retread. Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through this \u201cSnow White\u201d: to give its singing protagonist ( Rachel Zegler ) more agency; to expand that notion of \u201cfair\u201d beyond skin tone; to reframe that problematic prince. But all that updating adds up to a mishmash of a fable, caught in between now and once upon a time.",
      "It wouldn\u2019t be an earthshattering observation to note that a 1930s cartoon, let alone a 19th century German folk tale, might not be entirely in line with contemporary culture. Most of these Disney live-action remakes have carried with them more than a few notes of correction and atonement for the past \u2014 a laudable goal that means a generation of kids might not need a brief history lesson to go along with an old classic.",
      "But it\u2019s a tricky thing reworking a fable that\u2019s been around two centuries, and that\u2019s doubly true when leaping from the two-dimensional fantasy realm of animation to the more complicated land of flesh and bone. Webb\u2019s \u201cSnow White\u201d has been a veritable case study for the headaches that can arise when a window into the real world is cracked open. Everything from Israel's war in Gaza (Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, have differing opinions), the humanity of little people (there\u2019s a reason \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d has been stripped from the title) and the alleged \u201cwoke\u201d-ness of the production have been fuel for what we can gently refer to as online debate.",
      "Despite some gloriously lush production design, \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 innocent of most of those backlashes though not all \u2014 can\u2019t quite thread the needle. Even the new songs (by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) that are good (\"Waiting on a Wish\") struggle to fit in alongside old standbys. Zegler does a spirited job remaking a classic Disney princess into a more modern woman; when she sings, the movie gets a lift. The last thing that's wrong with this \u201cSnow White\u201d is Zegler's casting.",
      "But like scaffolding that's been left up too long, the strain of renovation shows in Webb\u2019s film, particularly in its awkward handling of Dopey, Sneezy and company. The seven dwarfs, like the fawns and squirrels, are rendered in CGI. You could argue that this acknowledges the artificiality of a dated and offensive trope. But it also gives \u201cSnow White\u201d an uncanny quality, with all human characters but the dwarfs being played by real people. As if to Band-Aid over this, one of the woodsmen is played by an actor of short stature (George Appleby) whose presence seems like yet another atonement, only one for this \u201cSnow White,\u201d not 1937\u2019s.",
      "You might be thinking: But what about the movie? The problem with \u201cSnow White\u201d is that you never stop thinking about these much-strategized and sometimes superficial efforts to recontextualize the original movie. Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay remakes Snow White's story as less a princess awaiting her Prince Charming (the song \u201cSomeday My Prince Will Come\" has been jettisoned) than an heir to a throne who loses her gumption. Though taught as a child to be \u201cfair\u201d as a leader by her father king (Hadley Fraser), Snow White has lost any ambition by the time Gadot's Evil Queen takes over the kingdom.",
      "Gadot sinks her teeth into the Evil Queen, a spikey, slinky villain who moves with a metallic rustle (the costumes are by Sandy Powell). But she feels cut off from the movie, without the lines that would elevate her flamboyant performance into something memorable. The prince has been altogether scrubbed; instead Andrew Burnap plays the blandly cocksure bandit Jonathan who encourages Snow White not to wait for her father's rescue.",
      "Presumably one of the reasons to bring actors into remakes of animated classics would be to add a warm-blooded pulse to these characters. Zegler manages that, but everyone else in \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 mortal or CGI \u2014 is as stiff as could be. You're left glumly scorekeeping the updates \u2014 one win here, a loss there \u2014 while pondering why, regardless of the final tally, recapturing the magic of long ago is so elusive.",
      "\u201cSnow White,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for violence, some peril, thematic elements and brief rude humor. Running time: 109 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "\u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d is how bestselling thriller writer Paula Hawkins describes the debut novel, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d from Hannah Deitch",
      "When bestselling psychological thriller writer Paula Hawkins (\u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d 2015) stamps the cover of your debut novel with \u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d your career is off to a fast start.",
      "The same goes for the plot pace of Hannah Deitch\u2019s book, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d which opens at a breakneck clip and doesn\u2019t really slow down for about 200 pages. Evie Gordon is our narrator. She went to \u201ca liberal arts school, stupidly expensive,\u201d and is now working as an SAT tutor in pricey California zip codes. Her first sentence is a gem: \u201cI was once a famous murderess.\u201d The rest of the book reveals how she earned that appellation and the adverb \u201conce.\u201d",
      "The opening scene is at \u201cThe Victor House,\u201d which Evie describes in great detail \u2014 its \u201clive-edge table cut from Portuguese wood,\u201d the \u201cDe Gournay hand-painted silk wallpaper,\u201d and the \u201caquamarine Moroccan tile in the bathroom.\u201d It\u2019s where Evie discovers the dead bodies of Dinah and Peter Victor, the mother with her face bashed in and the father floating in a koi pond. As Evie flees, she hears a voice crying out for help and rescues a woman trapped behind a door under a staircase, before coming face-to-face with her tutoring student, Serena. Thinking Evie and her accomplice are killers fleeing the scene of their crime, Serena attacks with a lamp and the scene ends with Evie smashing a vase against Serena\u2019s head before escaping with the mystery woman in Evie\u2019s car.",
      "Cue the Hans Zimmer soundtrack for the next 100+ pages as Evie gets to know her partner in crime, who doesn\u2019t speak at first, traumatized by whatever happened to her in the house. Eventually we learn her name, Jae, and together they pull off a series of crimes, some petty (shoplifting, carjacking), some not (assaulting and shooting at a few men and boys who recognize them from TV). Throughout it all, Evie\u2019s inner monologue keeps readers engaged as she ponders things like how the language of courtship (Chase. Pursue. Stalk.) mirrors the language of hunting. It\u2019s clear after a while that Evie and Jae lust for one another and when that dam finally breaks, the novel takes on a torrid tone that feels authentic for two people on the run for weeks relying on only each other and their animal instincts to survive.",
      "Of course, Paula Hawkins doesn\u2019t blurb your book unless there\u2019s a well-earned twist, and \u201cKiller Potential\u201d delivers on that front. The final third or so of the novel is a real joy to read as Deitch fills in all the blanks using different narrative techniques. Saying anything more would spoil the fun, but \u201cKiller Potential\u201d earns Deitch a spot on the \u201cnew novelists to watch\u201d list.",

      "Jonathan Majors plays an amateur bodybuilder in the dark drama \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s rage simmering inside Killian Maddox, the amateur bodybuilder portrayed by Jonathan Majors at the heart of the dark and stylized film \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a kind of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d for the incel age, a harrowing portrait of untreated mental illness, violence, false idols, steroids and male loneliness. There was, from the beginning, lots to discuss and debate in the fabric of \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d But in the two years since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, it was also eclipsed by the very real-life travails of its star, who was convicted of assaulting his former girlfriend.",
      "In January 2023, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d had an exciting future with Oscar hopes for Majors. Searchlight Pictures won the distribution rights, reportedly over the likes of Neon and Sony Pictures Classics. And Majors was skyrocketing to the top, with big roles in \u201cCreed III\u201d and as Marvel\u2019s new main villain, Kang. But two months later, he was arrested. By that December, Majors was found guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation and fired by Marvel. A month later, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d was without distribution. Majors has, throughout it all, maintained his innocence.",
      "The film was eventually picked up by Briarcliff Entertainment, the same distributor who jumped in to release the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d after the rest of the entertainment business shied away from it. \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d went on to get Oscar nominations for its two stars.",
      "But there\u2019s a different kind of stigma around \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which is why this review has also been a bit eclipsed by what's happened in Majors' life. It\u2019s a film about a man teetering on the edge of violence, about the relentless pursuit of greatness \u2014 and it is deeply uncomfortable watching his descent.",
      "His simplistic devotion to one wild goal may be his undoing in a world that just doesn\u2019t care about him. This is not the movie that any public relations professional would choose as a \u201ccomeback role.\u201d Yet it\u2019s impossible to deny the monumental ferocity of Majors\u2019 performance, from his full transformation to his unsettling ability to show the pain behind (most of) the psychotic actions.",
      "Killian\u2019s life is nothing glamorous: He works in a grocery store and at home cares for his aging grandfather. But he has an intense, maniacal need to be seen and to be remembered. And the only way he\u2019s figured out how to achieve that is through physical perfection \u2014 or at least his very narrow idea. Success is a magazine cover, which he naively conflates with immortality.",
      "When co-worker Jessie (Haley Bennett, who does a lot with a small, somewhat thankless role) agrees to go out on a date with him, he is genuinely shocked that she isn\u2019t familiar with his bodybuilding idol, saying something to the effect of \u201cyou need to get out more.\u201d",
      "Writer-director Elijah Bynum effectively imbues his film with stylized intensity. You feel uneasy and captivated from the start, though you try to give Killian the benefit of the doubt \u2014 to look for his goodness, to root for his success, if only for the hope that it might keep him docile for a little longer. Though we\u2019re told early that he\u2019s had violent episodes, through his court-ordered therapist, the glass isn\u2019t fully shattered until Jessie starts to process that Killian is someone she needs to get away from, fast. This is notably after he orders perhaps $500 worth of protein on the date, just for himself. Sadly, we don\u2019t get to see the bill.",
      "While \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d is an interesting character study, one many actors would love to play for all its dramatic opportunities, it also seems crafted entirely to provoke and shock \u2014 especially in the almost unbearably bleak final hour. After two viewings, one of which I had to take a break from during one of his violent outbursts, I\u2019m not actually sure what it\u2019s trying to say about men, about trauma, about 'roid rage. Killian seems less like an authentic person and more a simplistic stand-in for the forgotten person, the quiet weirdo who ends up a mass killer.",
      "And yet as movies are being accused of being too straightforward, too moralistic, too simple, perhaps some ambiguity, some discomfort, some unresolved unpleasantness is overdue. Majors is a force, and Bynum is certainly a director to watch. The question with \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which was the same in January 2023 as it is in March 2025 is: Will anyone?",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cviolent content, drug use, sexual material, nudity and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "The Latin Grammys are getting closer to cinema and television with the new best music for visual media category.",
      "The new category announced Wednesday will recognize original music for movies, TV shows, video games and other visual media. For a project to participate in this category, it must feature Latin rhythms or be composed by someone of Ibero American descent.",
      "The Latin Grammys will also add a best roots song category. This award will go to the songwriters of new, unpublished recordings that reflect the traditions and roots of various communities, cultures, or social groups, especially those of Hispanic American origin, whether in Spanish, Portuguese or Indigenous languages or dialects.",
      "The changes are immediate and will be effective for the 26th edition of the Latin Grammys to be handed out in November in Miami.",
      "Among other changes announced by the Latin Recording Academy, the best pop vocal album category will be renamed best contemporary pop album and the best Latin children's album will now become best children's album.",
      "The best urban/urban fusion performance category has a new name, and its criteria has also changed. Now, remixes are eligible only if the original version of the song was released within the same eligibility year. The required percentage of urban elements has increased from 51% to 60% to qualify in this category.",
      "The songwriter of the year category reduced its minimum song threshold from six songs to four, and the best long form music video category now has a minimum duration of 12 minutes (not including the credits, unless they contribute to the creative process).",
      "The screening and voting process for the producer of the year category was also modified to be recognized as a craft, and thus, will now be screened and voted on by a specialized committee in addition to the membership screening and voting process.",

      "As CBS' parent company considers settlement of President Donald Trump's lawsuit against \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America\u2019s storied newsmagazine is pulling no punches in its coverage of the new administration",
      "NEW YORK -- As CBS corporate leaders ponder settling President Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against the network's \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America's storied newsmagazine has produced some fast and hard-hitting stories critical of the new administration in every episode since Trump was inaugurated.",
      "The latest was Sunday, when CBS News helped pay for a performance featuring non-white middle and high school musicians who had won a contest and with it, the right to play with the U.S. Marine Corps Band. The original concert, however, was canceled because of Trump's executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "Correspondent Scott Pelley narrated six of the show's seven stories since Trump's inauguration, including Sunday's. He examined the administration\u2019s policies toward Ukraine and tariffs, looked at changes in the Justice Department and reported on firings of government watchdogs. Shortly after his piece on the dismantling of USAID, Elon Musk suggested \u201clong prison sentences\u201d for those working on the show.",
      "All came at a time when television's most popular and influential news broadcast was being watched to see how it would respond to a unique pressure.",
      "\u201cThis may be a lawsuit that is designed to intimidate, but they are clearly making a statement that they will not be intimidated,\u201d said Tom Bettag, a longtime television news producer who worked under Mike Wallace and Morley Safer at the CBS show.",
      "Pelley, meanwhile, has quickly become a polarizing figure.",
      "\u201cAnother week, another \u201860 Minutes\u2019 story trying to discredit Trump policies,\u201d Brent Baker, editor of the conservative media watchdog NewsBusters, wrote on X on Sunday night.",
      "Trump's lawsuit, coupled with a parallel Federal Communications Commission investigation, accuses \u201c60 Minutes\u201d of election interference for the way it edited Bill Whitaker's interview last fall with Trump's 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris.",
      "Two sound bites, broadcast on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and CBS' \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d depicted Harris giving different responses to Whitaker in a discussion about Israel. CBS said Harris made both comments in her answer to Whitaker and that the two shows ended up using different parts of a long sound bite. CBS argued the apparent discrepancy was typical of editing and not, as Trump has suggested, that different remarks by Harris were used to make her look better.",
      "CBS parent Paramount Global filed new motions in the past two weeks to get both the lawsuit and the FCC probe dismissed. Still, Shari Redstone, head of Paramount, is reportedly anxious for a settlement, much like Disney agreed to pay $16 million in December to end Trump's lawsuit against ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. Complicating matters is Paramount's proposed merger with Skydance Media, which needs approval from the Trump administration.",
      "Many at CBS News resist a settlement, insisting \u201c60 Minutes\u201d did nothing wrong. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, told his staff last month that he would not apologize as part of any prospective settlement.",
      "\u201cMy precious \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is fighting, quite frankly, for our life,\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl said earlier this month in accepting a First Amendment award from the Radio Television Digital News Association. \u201cI am so proud of \u201860 Minutes\u2019 that we are standing up and fighting for what is right.\u201d",
      "Neither Owens nor Pelley would comment on whether the show is trying to deliver any sort of message about the lawsuit through its work. Bettag said he believed \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is motivated by the importance of the stories.",
      "What the show has done during the past two months is striking, said Bettag, now a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cThe \u201860 Minutes\u2019 people are such committed journalists that they\u2019d consider it foolish to be doing these stories because of what is a frivolous lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lawsuit pales in comparison with the monumental changes Trump is trying to implement. Those correspondents and producers know that this is a moment that requires their very best work.\"",
      "Some of the segments were unusually urgent for the newsmagazine, which tends to do longer-range stories that could take months to produce. Pelley's March 2 report about Ukraine came only days after the White House confrontation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk's angry comment on his X social media platform came after Pelley's Feb. 16 story about the billionaire's role in the quick shutdown of the USAID office. \u201cThe world's richest man had cut off assistance to the world's poorest families,\u201d Pelley said, noting that Musk collects \u201cbillions of taxpayer dollars\u201d for his SpaceX company.",
      "Hours later, Musk wrote on X: \u201c60 Minutes are the biggest liars in the world! They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election. They deserve a long prison sentence.\u201d",
      "Other news organizations have done admirable work under difficult circumstances, said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor. Besides Pelley, he cited the news staff of the Washington Post at a time the newspaper\u2019s owner, Jeff Bezos, has shown more friendliness to Trump.",
      "Sunday\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story involved some elite high school students \u2014 each of them either of either Black, Hispanic, Indian or Asian descent \u2014 who had earned the right to play with the Marine band before the show was called off.",
      "CBS worked with Equity Arc, an organization devoted to increasing the number of minority students playing classical music, to organize a show for family and friends of the students outside Washington, D.C.. Retired members of military bands were brought in to work with the students. CBS News, which wanted to interview the students, paid for the travel and lodging of 22 of them.",
      "Pelley called it the \u201cconcert that was not meant to be heard.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds,\u201d he said. \u201cHere tonight, these musicians are being heard by millions.\u201d",
      "Pelley's March 9 report, \u201cFiring the Watchdogs,\u201d was about Trump's efforts to fire inspector generals and thwart others who protect whistleblowers in government agencies. He quoted Trump as saying the firings were standard for a new administration taking office. \u201cHe's wrong,\u201d Pelley said.",
      "His story about the U.S. Justice Department examined the resistance among some prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\u201cAs he continues to step up his attacks on President Donald Trump and the new administration, Pelley is elbowing aside all others to emerge as Trump's loudest TV critic,\u201d wrote Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner.",
      "In his stories, Pelley's deadpan voice and methodical style could not hide the sharpness of some observations. While narrating the story about USAID, Pelley noted that \u201cIt's too soon to tell how serious President Trump is in defiance of the Constitution.\"",

      "HOUSTON -- Dallas rapper Yella Beezy has been arrested and charged with capital murder in the shooting death of fellow rapper Mo3 on a busy interstate in 2020, according to court records.",
      "Yella Beezy, 33, whose real name is Markies Conway, was indicted by a Dallas County grand jury on Tuesday on a charge of capital murder while remuneration. The indictment accuses Conway of hiring a man named Kewon White to murder Mo3, whose real name was Melvin Noble.",
      "The indictment did not provide information on why authorities believe Conway hired White to shoot Noble, who also lived in Dallas.",
      "Court records did not list an attorney who could speak on behalf of Conway. Calls and emails to representatives for Conway were not immediately returned.",
      "In a Facebook post after Conway's arrest, Noble's mother, Nichole Williams Noble wrote, \u201cJustice for my baby!!!!\u201d",
      "The 28-year-old Noble was driving on Interstate 35 in south Dallas on Nov. 11, 2020, when authorities allege White drove up next to him and got out of his vehicle with a gun in his hand. Noble got out of his vehicle and began running south on the freeway as White shot at him, authorities said. Noble and a bystander who was inside a car were shot by White, police said. The bystander survived but Noble died at a hospital.",
      "White and another man, Devin Brown, 32, were later indicted in Noble\u2019s death. Their cases related to Noble\u2019s death remain pending. White, 26, was sentenced in 2022 in a separate case to nearly nine years in federal prison after pleading guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.",
      "Conway is best known for his 2017 single, \u201cThat\u2019s On Me\u201d and the 2019 song \u201cBacc At It Again\u201d with Quavo and Gucci Mane.",
      "In October 2018, Conway survived being shot while driving on a tollway in the Dallas suburb of Lewisville when someone pulled up next to him and opened fire, hitting him three times.",
      "Noble had more than 800,000 followers on his Instagram page and was best known for a 2019 remix of the song \u201cErrybody,\u201d with Baton Rouge, Louisiana, rapper Boosie Badazz.",

    "story": [
      "Robert De Niro's doing double duty in \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d literally",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the actor!\u201d shouts Anna Genovese at her estranged spouse, gangster Vito Genovese, in a courtroom where he\u2019s implausibly claiming he lacks funds to support her. \u201cThe best actor in the world! Better than Clark Gable!\u201d",
      "And we all chuckle. They probably all chuckled on set, too. Because the man playing Vito in \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d is none other than Robert De Niro, indeed one of the best actors in the world, revered in our time as Gable was in his.",
      "It\u2019s a cute moment and an apt one, too, because Barry Levinson\u2019s film, which aims but fails to channel the magic of decades-old mob movies like \u201cGoodfellas\u201d \u2014 though penned by the same writer, Nicholas Pileggi \u2014 is all about De Niro. Actually, it\u2019s all about De Niro AND De Niro. The man plays both lead roles, feuding mobsters Genovese and Frank Costello, in a story based on real events.",
      "Is it a gimmick? Surely. Does it work? Well, there\u2019s the entertainment value \u2014 this is De Niro, after all \u2014 and if you feel that more De Niro minutes are always better, then it follows that two roles are better than one. Others may feel it has a mob-themed \u201cParent Trap\u201d vibe, less weighty than it should be given the obviously violent subject matter.",
      "Also, \u201cGoodfellas\u201d fans may wonder if the Vito role was once intended for Joe Pesci (the movie\u2019s been in development forever), so similar is the character to that actor\u2019s impulsive, manically suspicious persona. On the other hand, in two brief scenes where the De Niros appear together for momentous meetings, one might be forgiven for wondering if Al Pacino was in line at some point, for a \u201cHeat\u201d-like moment.",
      "Happily, De Niro relies here on makeup, and not de-aging as in \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d though it must be said that, at times, his two characters just don\u2019t look different enough. More importantly, \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d despite its pedigree, doesn't rise anywhere near the heights of its glorious predecessors. It is, rather, an enjoyable if choppily paced look at a relationship between two men, where unfortunately we\u2019re arriving pretty late in the game.",
      "There are, though, a few crackling surprises: that domestic courtroom scene; a tense, televised Senate committee grilling; and finally a climactic gathering of mob bosses in the countryside, with fabulous period vehicles parked on the lawn and sausages on the grill, that's disrupted in comically sudden fashion.",
      "We begin in 1957 in Manhattan. Costello, after a night partying respectably with high society, stops at his swank apartment building. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you,\u201d declares the nervous man who shoots him in the head in his lobby.",
      "The shooter (Cosmo Jarvis), sent by Genovese, makes a bad mistake, as his boss will remind him later: \u201cYou gotta go SEE if they\u2019re dead!\u201d Amazingly, Costello survives. \u201cI shoulda been paying more attention,\u201d says the genteel mobster who favors diplomacy over bloodletting, narrating from the future.",
      "We then go back in time to figure out how things got this bad.",
      "With the help of vintage photos and footage artfully edited to include actors playing the younger Frank and Vito, we learn the two were good friends as young Italian immigrants on the streets. But when Vito got mixed up in a murder case, he had to flee to Italy \u2014 leaving cooler-headed Frank in charge of the business.",
      "Years later, Vito returns, and wants his role at the top of the mob family. And so things go south, quickly.",
      "The women in their lives mirror the differences between the two men. Costello\u2019s wife of more than 50 years, Bobbie (Debra Messing, making a nice foray into drama), is a loyal partner who urges her husband to retire and leave New York \u2014 along with their adorable dogs (De Niro\u2019s own pooches, dressed in mink coats and hats \u2014 a costume design Oscar for this canine fashion, please!). Genovese\u2019s wife Anna (Kathrine Narducci, excellent) is a businesswoman \u2014 she owns a gay bar \u2014 whose fiery union with Vito turns disastrous.",
      "A mere glance at Wikipedia will tell you that both Genovese and Costello ultimately died in nonviolent ways. There\u2019s plenty in \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d that you won\u2019t see there \u2014 for example, the movie's version of just who engineered that farmland mob summit, and why.",
      "But watching dozens of mobsters run like heck when police happen upon their gathering is a hoot, and it\u2019s hard to beat the moment when two of them insist to suspicious cops: \u201cWe\u2019re hunters!\u201d",
      "If only such witty moments were more frequent in a two-hour movie that somehow, alas, feels much longer.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d a Warner Bros. Pictures release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor violence and pervasive language.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "GENEVA -- GENEVA (AP) \u2014",
      "The head of the U.N. AIDS agency said Monday that the sudden loss of American money has been \u201cdevastating\u201d for efforts to stop HIV and will cost many lives of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. But she also proposed an \u201camazing deal\u201d for U.S. President Donald Trump that she said could result in \u201cthe end of AIDS.\u201d",
      "At a news briefing in Geneva, UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said that the deal would involve Trump enabling the U.S. company Gilead to produce and license its \u201cmagical\u201d prevention drug lenacapavir across the world to the millions of people who need it.",
      "Lenacapavir, sold as Sunlenca, has been shown through twice-yearly injections to completely prevent HIV infection in women and which works nearly as well in men.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump likes deals,\u201d Byanyimasaid, acknowledging that it was President George W. Bush who first started paying for the widespread roll-out of HIV drugs more than two decades ago.",
      "\u201cIt could be President Trump, another Republican president, who leads the prevention revolution towards the end of AIDS,\u201d Byanyima said.",
      "She added that the deal would result not only in profits for Gilead and create jobs for Americans, but save millions of lives in poorer countries.",
      "Byanyima said that American money made up about 35% of UNAIDS\u2019 core budget last year but it was unclear whether that might be restored for next year. She said the agency was in talks with the U.S. government but was also preparing for a worst-case scenario, in which there was no funding available from the U.S.",
      "Byanyima said it was unlikely any other donors would be able to fill that vacuum, adding that European donors have told the agency they would be cutting back on their support in order to redirect their funds to defense and other priorities.",
      "Byanyima said that unless support to HIV efforts is restored, there could be more than 6.3 million additional deaths in the next four years and an additional 2,000 people per day becoming infected.",
      "She acknowledged that there has been some valid criticism regarding how HIV aid has been delivered, calling it \u201can opportunity to rethink and develop more efficient ways of delivering life-saving support.\u201d",
      "Byanyima also said African countries were trying to become more self-sufficient and that even some of the poorest nations were now \u201ctrying to stretch very weak, fragile health systems to absorb people living with HIV.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations",
      "WASHINGTON -- With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is eliminating or reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations, which meteorologists and former agency leaders said will degrade the accuracy of forecasts just as severe weather season kicks in.",
      "The normally twice-daily launches of weather balloons in about 100 locations provide information that forecasters and computer models use to figure out what the weather will be and how dangerous it can get, so cutting back is a mistake, said eight different scientists, meteorologists and former top officials at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 the weather service's parent agency.",
      "The balloons soar 100,000 feet in the air with sensors called radiosondes hanging about 20 feet below them that measure temperature, dew point, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction.",
      "\u201cThe thing about weather balloons is that they give you information you can't get any other way,\u201d said D. James Baker, a former NOAA chief during the Clinton administration. He had to cut spending in the agency during his tenure but he said he refused to cut observations such as weather balloons. \u201cIt's an absolutely essential piece of the forecasting system.\u201d",
      "University of Oklahoma environment professor Renee McPherson said, \u201cThis frankly is just dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBad,\u201d Ryan Maue, who was NOAA's chief scientist at the end of President Donald Trump's first term, wrote in an email. \u201cWe should not degrade our weather system by skipping balloon launches. Not only is this embarrassing for NOAA, the cessation of weather balloon launches will worsen America's weather forecasts.\u201d",
      "Launches will be eliminated in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, \u201cdue to a lack of Weather Forecast Office (WFO) staffing,\u201d the weather service said in a notice issued late Thursday. It also is cutting from twice daily to once daily launches i n Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska and Riverton, Wyoming.",
      "The Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency fired hundreds, likely more than 1,000, NOAA workers earlier this year. The government then sent out letters telling probationary employees let go that they will get paid, but should not report to work.",
      "Earlier this month, the agency had announced weather balloon cuts in Albany, New York and Gray, Maine, and in late February, it ended launches in Kotzebue, Alaska. That makes 11 announced sites with reduced or eliminated balloon observations, or about one out of nine launch locations which include part of the Pacific and Caribbean.",
      "Among regularly reporting weather stations, NOAA had averaged about only one outage of balloon launches a day from 2021 to 2024, according to an Associated Press analysis of launch data.",
      "Meteorologists Jeff Masters and Tomer Burg calculate that 14 of 83 U.S. balloon sites, or 17%, are doing partial or no launches. That includes two stations that aren't launching because of a helium shortage and a third that is hindered because of coastal erosion.",
      "\u201cThe more data we can feed into our weather models, the more accurate our forecasts, but I can\u2019t speculate on the extent of future impacts,\u201d weather service spokesperson Susan Buchanan said in an email.",
      "University at Albany meteorology professor Kristen Corbosiero looked at the map of launches Friday and said \u201cwow, that is an empty area ... That's not great.\u201d",
      "Corbosiero works in the building where the Albany weather service used to go to the roof to launch twice-daily weather balloons. It's now down to one at night, which she said it is worrisome heading into severe weather season.",
      "\u201cFor those of us east of the Rocky Mountains, this is probably the worst time of year,\u201d said Oklahoma's McPherson. \u201cIt's the time of year that we have some of our largest tornado outbreaks, especially as we move into April and May.\u201d",
      "Former National Weather Service Director Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday said the weather balloons get \u201cthe detailed lower atmospheric level of temperature and humidity that can determine whether the atmosphere is going to be hot enough to set off severe storms and how intense they might be.\u201d",
      "Satellites do a good job getting a big picture and ground measurements and radar show what's happening on the ground, but the weather balloons provide the key middle part of the forecasting puzzle \u2014 the atmosphere \u2014 where so much weather brews, several meteorologists said.",
      "All of the 10 announced reductions are in the northern part of the United States. That's about where the jet stream \u2014 which is a river of air that moves weather systems across the globe \u2014 is this time of year, so not having as many observations is especially problematic, McPherson and Corbosiero said.",
      "Weather balloons are also vital for helping forecast when and where it will rain, said Baker and another former NOAA chief, Rick Spinrad.",
      "The weather agency has been launching balloons regularly since the 1930s. During World War II, weather balloon launches in the Arctic helped America win the air battle over Europe with better forecasts for planes, former weather chief Friday said.",
      "It takes 90 minutes to an hour to fill a weather balloon with helium or hydrogen, get it fitted with a sensor, then ready it for launch making sure the radiosonde doesn't drag on the ground, said Friday, who recalled launching a balloon in Nome, Alaska with 30 mph winds and windchill of about 30 degrees below zero.",
      "Meteorologists then track the data for a couple hours before the balloon falls back to the ground for a total of about four of five hours work for one person, Friday said.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of fun to do,\u201d Friday said on Friday.",

      "BAMAKO, Mali -- Amadou Ndiaye meticulously ran his fingers across bumps in a piece of paper, making sense of the world he can no longer see.",
      "Two hundred years have passed since the invention of braille, the tactile writing system that has transformed the lives of many blind and partially sighted people by offering a path to literacy and independence.",
      "\u201cBraille helped me live my life,\" said Ndiaye, a social worker in Mali who lost his eyesight as a child. \u201cBefore, people asked themselves the question: Here is someone who can\u2019t see, how will he make it? How will he integrate into society?\u201d",
      "The West African country, with a population of over 20 million people, has long struggled to integrate blind and partially sighted people. According to eye care charity Sightsavers, around 170,000 people in Mali are thought to be blind.",
      "The 47-year-old Ndiaye was fortunate to attend the institute for the blind in Mali, where he learned to write in braille, and told himself: \u201cReally, everything that others do, I can do too.\u201d He later attended university.",
      "He said braille has allowed him to develop his main passion, playing the guitar, which also emphasizes the importance of touch.",
      "\u201cEach pressure on the strings, each movement of the finger on the neck, becomes a living note, loaded with meaning,\" Ndiaye said.",
      "The guitar is an integral part of Mali's griot tradition, the cultural practice of storytelling through music. Musicians adapted the guitar to emulate the sounds of traditional string instruments like the kora. Local artists such as Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 have fused Malian melodies with elements of the blues, creating a soulful, hypnotic sound that has gained international acclaim.",
      "Iconic Malian musical duo Amadou and Mariam awakened Ndiaye's passion for the instrument when he was a boy.",
      "\u201cOne day, near a photography studio, I heard their music resonating through the window, which pushed me to discover this universe,\u201d he said.",
      "Known as \u201cthe blind couple from Mali,\" the duo of Amadou Bagayoko, who lost his vision at age 16, and Mariam Doumbia, who became blind at age 5 as a consequence of untreated measles, rose to international fame in the 1990s with their fusion of traditional Malian music, rock, and blues.",
      "The couple met at Mali's institute for the blind, where Doumbia was studying braille and teaching classes in dance and music.",
      "At such places, braille has allowed students to overcome educational barriers such as taking longer to learn how to read and write. They can then take the same exams as anyone else, which allows them to seek employment, said Ali Moustapha Dicko, who teaches at the institute for the blind in the capital, Bamako.",
      "Dicko is also blind. Using a special typewriter, he can create texts in braille for his students. But he says his students are still at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cWe have a crisis of teaching materials,\u201d Dicko said. He has one reading book in braille for his entire class of dozens of students.",
      "But with the development of new technologies, some blind and partially sighted people hope that educational barriers will continue to fall.",
      "\u201cThere is software, there are telephones that speak, so there are many things that are vocal,\u201d said Bagayoko of the musical duo. \u201cThis allows us to move forward.\u201d",
      "But Moussa Mbengue, the Senegal-based program officer for inclusive education at Sightsavers, said such advances still don't make the leap that braille did two centuries ago.",

      "Decades of road salt use is taking a toll on New York City\u2019s water reservoirs",
      "The suburban reservoirs that supply 10% of New York City's vaunted drinking water are getting saltier due to decades of road salt being spread near the system \u2014 and they will eventually have to be abandoned if nothing is done to reverse the trend, city officials warn.",
      "The plug wouldn't have to be pulled until early next century, according to a new study. But the soaring saltiness could eventually affect the famous taste of the Big Apple\u2019s water, which is sometimes called the champagne of tap water, and poses a challenge to managers of a system that serves more than 9 million people.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion of this study is that if we don\u2019t change our ways, in 2100 the Croton Water System becomes a nice recreational facility, but it ceases to be a water supply,\u201d Rohit Aggarwala, the city\u2019s environmental protection commissioner, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that will directly impact everybody who drinks New York City water.\u201d",
      "The Croton system dates back to 1842 \u2014 when the first Croton Aqueduct began delivering water to a reservoir in what is now Manhattan\u2019s Central Park \u2014 and is now comprised of 12 reservoirs and three controlled lakes north of the city.",
      "The report found the concentration of chlorides \u2014 an indicator of salinization \u2014 tripled from 1987 to 2019 in the system's main reservoir, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the city line. Concentrations are on track to exceed the state\u2019s maximum contaminant level for chloride by 2108.",
      "The report found salinity increases across the sprawling system of city reservoirs in upstate New York. However, the problem is far less of an issue in the Delaware and Catskill watersheds west of the Hudson River, which supply about 90% of the city\u2019s water. That\u2019s likely because there\u2019s far less development in those watersheds.",
      "Road salt is considered a main driver of the increase, along with sewage treatment plant discharges and water softeners. Millions of tons of rock salt is spread on U.S. roads each winter as a cheap and effective way to reduce accidents.",
      "\u201cIt's really a problem across the country in areas with a lot of snow,\u201d said Shannon Roback, science director for the environmental group Riverkeeper. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen rising levels of salt in water in the Northeast, in the Midwest and in most places that use road salt.\u201d",
      "Roback noted that high salt levels in drinking water pose a host of environmental concerns and can be harmful to people on low-sodium diets.",
      "Aggarwala said the city has a few options.",
      "Salt can be removed from water supplies through reverse osmosis systems, though the technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. The city also could mix Croton water with less salty water from its other two watersheds. But the commissioner said that would not be a solution for the more than a dozen municipalities north of New York City that draw water from the Croton system.",
      "City officials believe reducing the use of road salt locally is the most sensible option. That could involve persuading state and local road crews to use alternatives to salt, or sensors on plows to gauge road surface temperatures, or shutting off the applicators when plows make U-turns or K turns.",
      "State Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents the area, called the new report alarming, but not surprising given a number of community wells taken offline due to high chloride levels. The Democrat is sponsoring bills that would address the road salt issue, including one that would study the issue in the Croton watershed.",
      "\u201cState agencies, local governments, everyone needs to come together on this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause this is a real challenge.\u201d",

      "The Minnesota case has also drawn attention for an attempt to bribe a juror in an earlier trial and witness tampering in Bock's trial, which began last month. Thirty-seven defendants have already pleaded guilty, while five were convicted in a group of defendants who were tried last year.",
      "The jury also convicted a co-defendant, Salim Ahmed Said, owner of the now-defunct Safari Restaurant in Minneapolis.",
      "Bock, 44, and Said, 36, were charged with multiple counts involving conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery. Said was also charged with money laundering. Bock allegedly pocketed nearly $2 million, while Said was accused of taking around $5 million. They both maintained their innocence and testified at trial.",
      "U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel ordered them both held without bail pending their sentencing, for which she did not set a date.",
      "\u201cIt was the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and what Bock and and her co-defendants did was reprehensible.\u201d Lisa Kirkpatrick the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, said at a news conference afterward.",
      "\u201cDuring COVID, while so many were trying to be helpers, Bock and Said were thieves,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey used a time of crisis as their golden opportunity to enrich themselves and their criminal partners \u2014 outlandishly so. At every step of the way, Bock fought to keep her fraud scheme going. Today her efforts to lie, to blame others, to escape responsibility, all came to an end.\u201d",
      "Bock's attorney, Kenneth Udoibok, said there will be an appeal. While he has not decided what legal grounds might be used as its basis, he told The Associated Press that the jury could not have fairly considered all six weeks' worth of evidence in the few hours they deliberated after getting the case Wednesday morning.",
      "But lead prosecutor Joe Thompson called the scheme \u201cbrazen and corrupt\u201d and told reporters it tarnished Minnesota's reputation for good governance and civic mindedness as well as its high quality of life and low crime.",
      "\u201cThe Feeding Our Future case has come to symbolize the problem of fraud in our state,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt has become the shame of Minnesota. Hopefully today\u2019s verdict will help turn the page in this awful chapter in our state\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who came under heavy criticism from Republicans who said his administration should have caught the fraud earlier, told reporters he remains \u201cfurious\u201d with \u201ccriminals that preyed on the system that was meant to feed children.\u201d But he pointed out that nobody in state government, which administered the federal funding, was ever charged in the case.",

      "Thompson said authorities have recovered only about $60 million of the $250 million that was stolen. He declined to speculate on what prosecutors might recommend for sentences but said Bock and Said face \u201csubstantial\u201d prison time.",
      "The defendants are being tried in several groups. The first trial was marred by an alleged attempt by some defendants and people linked with them to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror went straight to police. That led to tighter security for Bock\u2019s trial and additional precautions ordered by the judge.",
      "Despite all that, an allegation of witness tampering surfaced midway through the proceedings. A defendant scheduled for trial in August approached a government witness who was due to testify against Bock and Said and asked to speak with him in a courthouse bathroom. That witness declined and instead told his lawyer, who informed prosecutors.",
      "That defendant, Abdinasir Abshir, 32, of Lakeville, soon agreed to plead guilty to a wire fraud charge and to have his tampering attempt factored into a longer sentencing recommendation, which isn\u2019t binding on the judge.",

      "Members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma would hand over the company and up to $7 billion in cash in the latest plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "Purdue Pharma asked a bankruptcy judge late Tuesday to consider the latest version of its plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of the powerful prescription painkiller OxyContin, a deal that would have members of the Sackler family who own the company pay up to $7 billion.",
      "The filing is a milestone in a tumultuous legal saga that has gone on for more than five years.",
      "Under the deal the family members \u2014 estimated in documents from 2020 and 2021 to be worth about $11 billion \u2014 would give up ownership of the company in addition to contributing money over 15 years with the biggest payment up front.",
      "Family members resigned from Purdue's board, stopped receiving money from the company and ceased other involvement before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 as it faced lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments, plus others.",
      "The new entity would be run by a board appointed by state governments, and its mission will be to abate the opioid crisis that has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths in the U.S. since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The first wave of deadly overdoses were tied to OxyContin and other prescription drugs, and subsequent waves have involved first heroin and more recently illicit versions of fentanyl.",
      "This settlement plan was hammered out in months of mediation involving groups that sued Purdue, and nearly all of them are supporting it, according to mediator reports filed in court.",
      "Approval would take at least several more months.",
      "A previous version had bankruptcy court approval but was rejected last year by the U.S. Supreme Court because it protected members of the Sackler family from civil lawsuits even though none of them filed for bankruptcy protection themselves.",
      "Under the new version, plaintiffs will have to opt in to get full shares of the settlement. If they do not, they can still sue Sackler family members, who agreed to put in about $1 billion more than under earlier plans. The Sacklers' cash contribution would depends in part on how many parties join the settlement and on the sale of foreign drug companies. Some of the money they put into the settlement is to be reserved to pay any judgments if they are sued and lose; but if that doesn't happen, it's to go into the main settlement.",
      "Members of the family have been cast as villains and have seen their name removed from art galleries and universities around the world because of their role in the privately held company. They continue to deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Other drugmakers, distribution companies, pharmacy chains and others have already reached opioid lawsuit settlements worth about $50 billion, according to an Associated Press tally. Purdue's, which would also include about $900 million from company coffers, would be among the largest if finalized.",
      "The deals require most of the money be used to fight the opioid crisis.",
      "Purdue's is the only major one that also provides direct money for victims \u2014 potentially more than $850 million total in pools for people who became addicted, their families and babies born in withdrawal. That figure is more than in the previous incarnation.",
      "The deadline to apply for a piece of those funds passed years ago. In earlier versions, individuals were expected to receive between about $3,500 and $48,000. Families were split over the deal.",
      "Purdue would also provide millions of documents to a repository that would make them public. The company has also been producing a low-cost version of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses.",

    "story": [
      "A three-judge panel has ruled that Ohio\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and ordered it permanently blocked by a trial court",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio's ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and must be permanently blocked from being enforced, a three-judge panel of appellate judges ruled Tuesday. The law also banned trans women and girls from participating in female sports.",
      "The state attorney general vowed an immediate appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, the state 10th District Court of Appeals reversed a lower court judge's decision last summer to allow the law to go into effect, after finding it \u201creasonably limits parents' rights.\u201d The law bans counseling, gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy for minors, unless they are already receiving such therapies and a doctor deems it risky to stop.",
      "The litigation was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Ohio and the global law firm Goodwin, who argued the law not only denies health care to transgender children and teens, but specifically discriminates against them accessing it.",
      "The appellate court agreed, in a 2-1 majority opinion written by Judge Carly Edelstein, and cited a number of flaws in the lower court's reasoning.",
      "The judge cited a number of flaws in the lower court\u2019s reasoning. She said that the Ohio law does not outlaw identical drugs when they're used for other reasons, only when they're used for gender transitioning, which makes it discriminatory. She also said that a prescription ban is not a reasonable exercise of the state's police power when it is weighed against the rights of parents to care for their children.",
      "Addressing proponents' arguments that minors are not in a position to understand the long-term impacts such procedures could have on their lives, the judge said that, while they may not be, their parents are.",
      "\u201cThus, in considering whether the H.B. 68 ban is reasonable, it is necessary to keep in mind that the law recognizes the maturity, experience, and capacity of parents to make difficult judgments and act in their children\u2019s best interest,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The ACLU called the ruling \u201chistoric.\u201d",
      "\"This win restores the right of trans youth in Ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians,\" Freda Levenson, legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. \u201cWe are gratified by the Court\u2019s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with Ohioans\u2019 bodily autonomy.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's ruling marked the second blow for the legislation.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the law in December 2023, after touring the state to visit children\u2019s hospitals and talking to families of children with gender dysphoria. He cast his action as thoughtful, limited and \u201cpro-life\u201d \u2014 citing the suicide risks associated with minors who don't get proper treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "DeWine simultaneously announced plans to move to administratively ban gender-affirming surgeries until a person is 18, and to position the state to better regulate and track gender-affirming treatments in both children and adults. He hoped the move would allay concerns of fellow Republicans at the Ohio Statehouse, but the administration swiftly backed off that plan after transgender adults raised serious concerns about how state regulations could impact their lives and health.",
      "Ohio lawmakers stood their ground on the bill, easily overriding his veto \u2014 making Ohio the 23rd state to ban gender-affirming health care for trans youth.",
      "Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a candidate to succeed DeWine next year who serves as the Legislature's lawyer, quickly released a statement saying that he will appeal Tuesday's ruling.",
      "\u201cThis is a no-brainer \u2013 we are appealing that decision and will seek an immediate stay,\" he said. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children.\u201d",
      "Levenson acknowledged that Tuesday's ruling was likely not the end of the legal dispute, but she said in a statement that her organization remained \u201cfervently committed\u201d to preventing the bill from ever taking effect again.",

      "The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati is hearing arguments in a lawsuit pitting a suburban Ohio school district\u2019s policy on preferred pronouns against the free speech rights of classmates who believe there are only two genders",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati will hear arguments Wednesday in a legal dispute that pits a suburban Ohio school district's policy requiring use of students' preferred pronouns against the free speech rights of classmates who believe there are only two genders.",
      "The lawsuit brought by Parents Defending Education, a national Christian organization, against the Olentangy Local School District in 2023 has captured broad national attention from groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the conservative Manhattan Institute. Ohio's solicitor general has asked to participate in oral arguments on behalf of 22 U.S. states that have interests in the case.",
      "A lower court rejected the group\u2019s arguments that the policies violated students\u2019 First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and a three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit affirmed that decision in July.",
      "The full court will reconsider that decision in a rare en banc hearing Wednesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:",
      "The lawsuit takes issue with overlapping district policies that prohibit the use of gender-related language that other students might deem insulting, dehumanizing, unwanted or offensive and call for the use of peers' \u201cpreferred pronouns.\u201d",
      "The district's electronic devices policy \u2014 which applies both on and off school time \u2014 prohibits transmitting \u201cdisruptive\u201d material or material that could be seen as harassing or disparaging other students based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, among other categories.",
      "A separate antidiscrimination policy prohibits students from engaging in \u201cdiscriminatory language\u201d during times when they're under the school's authority. That is defined as \u201cverbal or written comments, jokes, and slurs that are derogatory towards an individual or group based on one or more of the following characteristics: race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and transgender identity), disability, age, religion, ancestry, or genetic information.\u201d",
      "The district's code of conduct echoes many of the same themes a third time.",
      "Parents Defending Education, founded in 2021 amid the culture wars over schools\u2019 teachings on race, diversity and sexuality, argues that the policies compel students and parents who belong to their group to \u201caffirm an idea that gender is fluid\u201d in contradiction of their religious beliefs.",
      "\u201cThese students have views that the District disfavors,\u201d the group wrote in a court filing. \u201cSpecifically, they believe that people are either male or female, that biological sex is immutable, and that sex does not change based on someone\u2019s internal feelings. Accordingly, they \u2018d(o) not want to be forced to \u2018affirm\u2019 that a biologically female classmate is actually a male \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 or that a classmate is \u2019nonbinary' and neither male nor female.\u201d",
      "The group argues that the policies unconstitutionally compel \u201cviewpoint-based\u201d speech by forcing students who believe in only two genders to use pronouns that suggest otherwise. They say that violates the First Amendment's guarantees to free speech and similar protections contained in the 14th Amendment, particularly since students are subject to punishment for violating the policies.",
      "Parents Defending Education further challenges the electronic devices policy for applying outside school hours and off school property. The ACLU has sided with the parents' group on this point, arguing the district's policies are overbroad.",
      "Olentangy Local School District outside Columbus, one of the state's largest districts, maintains the policies protect students against abuse and harassment and asserts that Parents Defending Education represents \u201cChristian, cisgender\u201d students \"seeking dispensation under the free speech clause of the First Amendment to harass other students based on their gender identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not illegal immigrants subject to deportation. They are not gay soldiers under Don't Ask Don't Tell. They're not African Americans in the Jim Crow south. They've not been systematically oppressed,\" the district's lawyers told the lower court. \"They're members of the majority who want to \u2014 under the guise of the First Amendment \u2014 openly voice their opposition to an historically maligned minority group, transgendered people.\u201d",
      "Olentangy argues that Parents Defending Education has failed to provide evidence of injury \u2014 as the lawsuit was filed before disciplinary action had been brought against any student. The district also says that its policies leave open other options for students who don't wish to use someone's preferred pronouns. That includes calling the person by their first name, using a gender-neutral pronoun or simply not referring to them at all.",
      "The availability of such options, an argument against the policies unconstitutionally compelling students to say certain things, played a role in the three-judge panel's 2-1 ruling in favor of the district last summer.",

      "A new study finds that a common blood test for ovarian cancer may miss some Black and Native American patients, delaying their treatment",
      "A common blood test may miss ovarian cancer in some Black and Native American patients, delaying their treatment, a new study finds. It's the latest example of medical tests that contribute to health care disparities.",
      "Researchers have been working to uncover these kinds of biases in medicine. Recently, the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion has jeopardized such research as universities react to political pressure and federal agencies comb through grants looking for projects that violate the president's orders.",
      "Native American women have the highest rate of ovarian cancer. Black women with ovarian cancer have lower rates of survival compared to white women. Finding ovarian cancer early can lead to better chances of survival.",
      "The new study, supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute and published Thursday in JAMA Network Open, looked at a test called CA-125. The test measures a tumor marker in the blood, and doctors use it to determine if a woman with a suspicious lump should be referred to a cancer specialist.",
      "Doctors depend on the test during early evaluations, so understanding what the results mean for people of different races and ethnicities is critical, said Dr. Shannon Westin of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the research.",
      "\u201cThis is a perfect example of work that absolutely needed to be stratified based on race and ethnicity,\" Westin said. The findings alert doctors that they shouldn't be totally reassured by a normal test result, she said.",
      "So far, it\u2019s unknown why the test doesn't perform uniformly across groups. The researchers suspect it has something to do with a harmless genetic variation that is more common in people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern and West Indian descent.",
      "Initial studies of the test, published in the 1980s, didn\u2019t record people\u2019s races but were in mostly white populations.",
      "The test isn't perfect for white women either, said lead author Dr. Anna Jo Smith of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school.",
      "\u201cBut if we have worse performance in certain groups, then we may be further contributing to disparities in referral, disparities in treatment, and ultimately we may be contributing to the lower survival in Black women with ovarian cancer,\" Smith said.",
      "The researchers analyzed data from more than 200,000 women with ovarian cancer from 2004 through 2020 who'd had a CA-125 blood test.",
      "Black and Native American patients were 23% less likely to have an elevated CA-125 level at ovarian cancer diagnosis compared with white patients, suggesting the current thresholds are set too high.",
      "The researchers also found that patients with false negative results started chemotherapy on average nine days later than patients with elevated levels. That could make a difference for some patients, Smith said.",
      "Last week, Smith and her colleagues presented work at a Society of Gynecologic Oncology meeting proposing a new lower threshold for the blood test that would work better across all populations. The work could lead to changes in guidelines.",
      "\u201cNew thresholds for referral will ensure that all patients get in for rapid care when ovarian cancer is suspected,\u201d Smith said.",

      "French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu is standing trial at a Paris courthouse on sexual assault charges",
      "PARIS -- French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu went on trial Monday in Paris on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a movie set, in a case seen as a potential watershed for the #MeToo movement in France.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant director during filming in 2021 of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d).",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted.",
      "Depardieu denies any wrongdoing. He told the judges that he was prepared to answer the court\u2019s questions.",
      "\u201cWe will be able to show in an impartial, objective and incontestable manner that all of the accusations are lies,\u201d his attorney, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, told journalists massed outside the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThe truth will be obvious and the truth is on our side,\u201d he said.",
      "Depardieu's long and storied career has turned the trial into a post- #MeToo test of the willingness of France and its movie industry to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.",
      "Depardieu has been a darling of French cinemagoers for decades and was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.",
      "But his alleged boorish behavior off-screen has also long made headlines. He has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some others were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.",
      "Feminist and historian Florence Montreynaud described Depardieu's court appearance as \u201ca historic moment\" for women's rights, as she joined other campaigners who demonstrated outside the court. A dozen chanted \u201cSexist violence, complicit judicial system\" as they danced to techno music.",
      "\u201cTimes are changing. \u201c#MeToo has swept through. At last, mentalities are changing,\u201d Montreynaud said to French broadcaster BFMTV.",
      "The trial also follows in the wake of the historic case last year involving Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, whose bravery put the spotlight on sexual violence in France. She demanded that the drugging-and-rape trial for 51 men tried for a horrific catalogue of abuse on her be held in open court, arguing that doing so would help make shame change sides.",
      "France has often been ambivalent \u2014 even resistant \u2014 toward the #MeToo movement. While Hollywood saw powerful men fall swiftly and publicly, the French film industry was slower to respond. Some dismissed #MeToo as an American export incompatible with French values, citing concerns over free expression and what they viewed as an erosion of flirtation culture.",
      "At the time of the alleged assaults, Depardieu was already under formal investigation for rape. In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024, prosecutors requested that it go to trial.",
      "Prosecutors say Depardieu trapped the set dresser with his legs before groping her waist and breasts in front of witnesses. She says the actor also used obscene language and had to be pulled away by bodyguards.",
      "The assistant director alleged that Depardieu groped her both on set and in the street.",
      "The women sat side by side in court. The Associated Press doesn\u2019t name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified. Neither has done so in this case.",
      "The trial is expected to last at least two days, but could be extended beyond Tuesday, if the chief judge wants more time. The trial was initially scheduled for October, but then postponed because of Depardieu\u2019s health. A verdict is expected at a later date.",
      "Depardieu grasped his lawyer's shoulder as he strode calmly into the courtroom. The actor has undergone a quadruple heart bypass and has diabetes, according to his lawyer. A court-appointed medical expert determined that he\u2019s fit to stand trial, but recommended that the hearings don't exceed six hours, with a 15-minute pause and snack every three hours.",
      "The first hours of Monday\u2019s hearing were largely taken up by Depardieu\u2019s lawyer, who sought to cast doubt on witness testimony and the police investigation. The attorney alleged, without providing evidence, that police acted under instructions from magistrates who led the investigation to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "Depardieu listened intently, sometimes nodding.",
      "The plaintiffs' lawyers were expected to lay out their evidence later. One of the lawyers, Carine Durrieu Diebolt, said on France Info radio before the trial opened that \u201cthe case is solid\u201d and that her client is \u201ccalmly awaiting the outcome.\u201d",
      "She said that four additional women who say they have been sexually assaulted by Depardieu will testify.",
      "In an open letter published in October 2023, Depardieu wrote: \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman.\u201d",
      "The actor had dropped out of sight in recent months, his film career seemingly on hold. But he still has friends in the industry. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.",

      "Witkoff met Putin after talks with Russian officials about trying to end the war in Ukraine. Ceasefire talks continued Monday in Saudi Arabia, where U.S. officials met their Russian counterparts, a day after meeting with Ukrainian negotiators.",
      "During his interview with Carlson, Witkoff described Putin\u2019s gift as \u201cgracious\u201d and recalled how Putin told him he had prayed for Trump last year when he heard the then-candidate for the U.S. presidency had been shot at a rally in Pennsylvania. \u201cHe was praying for his friend,\u201d Witkoff said, recounting Putin's comments.",
      "In 2018, Putin gave then-President Trump a soccer ball that the Secret Service had checked for listening devices before Trump gave it to his son \u2014 a precaution that hearkened back to a Soviet-era gift to a U.S. diplomat that turned out to be bugged.",
      "In 1945, a carving of the Great Seal of the United States was given as a gift from Soviet school children to then-U.S. Ambassador Averell Harriman. It hung in his office for six years allowing the Soviet Union to eavesdrop on his conversations until the State Department discovered that it contained a covert listening device.",
      "It was not immediately known if the portrait Putin gave to Trump had been examined for bugs. The White House hasn't commented on the portrait.",
      "Trump isn't the first sitting president to receive a gift from Putin. In 2021, Putin gave then-President Joe Biden a $12,000 lacquer writing box and pen when they met at a summit in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2013, he reportedly sent then-President Barack Obama porcelain plates and espresso cups.",
      "This apparently isn't the first portrait of a U.S. leader Putin has sent, either. In 2014, the Russia president reportedly sent to George H.W. Bush a portrait of the former president on his 90th birthday.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has lamented Canada\u2019s lost friendship with the United States as he visited the town that sheltered thousands of stranded American airline passengers after the 9/11 attacks",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney  on Monday lamented Canada\u2019s lost friendship with the United States as he visited the town that sheltered thousands of stranded American airline passengers after the 9/11 attacks.",
      "Carney's visit to Gander, Newfoundland on the second day of a national election campaign comes against the backdrop of a trade war and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s almost daily attacks on Canada\u2019s sovereignty have left Canadians feeling betrayed.",
      "\"In this crisis caused by the U.S. president and those who are enabling him, we lament a friendship lost,\" Carney said. \u201cIn Gander Canadians did extraordinary things for Americans when they needed it. Now, we need to do extraordinary things for ourselves.\u201d",
      "Gander opened its arms to nearly 6,600 airline passengers diverted there when the U.S. government shut down airspace during 9/11.",
      "In a matter of a few hours, the town population of 10,000 in 2001 was overwhelmed by 38 planeloads of travelers, yet locals went to work in their kitchens and cleaned up spare rooms to offer space and food to the newcomers.",
      "When more than 200 flights were diverted to Canada following the attacks on the United States, the Canadians shunted the traffic away from Toronto and Montreal to the eastern seaboard.",
      "Obscure, little-used Gander got to relive its glory days as a stopover point for trans-Atlantic aviation before long-distance flights became possible. Built in 1938 in anticipation of the coming world war, it had the world\u2019s longest runway, and on 9/11 it was the second busiest, taking in 38 flights to Halifax, Nova Scotia\u2019s 47.",
      "Flight crews quickly filled Gander\u2019s hotels, so passengers were taken to schools, fire stations and church halls. The Canadian military flew in 5,000 cots. Stores donated blankets, coffee machines, barbecue grills. Unable to retrieve their luggage, passengers became dependent on the kindness of strangers, and it came in the shape of clothes, showers, toys, banks of phones to call home free of charge, an arena that became a giant walk-in fridge full of donated food.",
      "Once all the planes had landed or turned back to Europe, Gander\u2019s air traffic controllers switched to cooking meals in the building nonstop for three days.",
      "\u201cMore than 6,000 passengers. Overnight, the town\u2019s population almost doubled,\u201d Carney said during a speech to residents. \u201cYou showed friendship to people who were fearful. In a crisis, you showed your character. When people needed help, you gave it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Carney visited the home of Beulah Cooper, who opened her home and comforted many, including Dennis and Hannah O\u2019Rourke, an elderly couple whose New York firefighter son, Kevin, went missing at the World Trade Center and was later confirmed to have died there.",
      "The O\u2019Rourkes remained friends with Cooper long after and went back to Gander, saying they felt eternally indebted.",
      "Now, Cooper says she feels betrayed by America, though she remains friends with Hannah O'Rourke, whose husband passed away. She also feels bad for her American friends.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s too many bad words for me to say on the phone about what I think of Trump,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cCanada was the best ally they had.\"",
      "Carney noted the Gander story of that day became legend, immortalized in the Canadian-made Broadway hit musical \u201cCome from Away.\u201d",
      "Carney said Canadians have always been by Americans' side whether it was during the Iran hostage crisis, or more recently during the California wildfires or in Afghanistan, where Canada lost 158 members of the armed forces and seven civilians.",
      "Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbor and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. The American president has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.",
      "Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products \u2014 as well as all of America\u2019s trading partners \u2014 on April 2.",
      "Carney said Canadians are over the shock of the betrayal but now have to look out for themselves. He said Canadians and Americans have traditionally been like brothers.",
      "\"But that\u2019s changed. And it wasn\u2019t us who did the changing. Unfortunately, President Trump\u2019s actions have put that kinship under greater strain today than at any point in our storied history,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Carney, at the start of a five-week election campaign before the vote on April 28, said he's not looking for friendship from the Americans. \u201cI am just looking for respect at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "The new prime minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn\u2019t had a phone call with Trump and suggested that might not happen until after the election. \u201cI\u2019m available for a call. But you know we are going to talk on our terms as a sovereign country, not as what he pretends we are,\u201d Carney said.",
      "He said the Americans are making a \u201cfundamental mistake\" in the trade war.",
      "\u201cThey think they will weaken us. They think that they can own us quite frankly, that\u2019s what they think,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to get stronger. We are going to wait this out. They are going to come to the table and we are going to negotiate a good deal for Canadians.\u201d",

      "In the latest twist in South Korea\u2019s ongoing political crisis, the country\u2019s Constitutional Court reinstated Prime Minister Han Duck-soo as acting leader, overturning his impeachment by opposition lawmakers three months ago",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the latest twist in South Korea\u2019s ongoing political crisis, the country\u2019s Constitutional Court reinstated Prime Minister Han Duck-soo as acting leader, overturning his impeachment by opposition lawmakers three months ago.",
      "The court\u2019s ruling on Monday marks just one front in the deepening turmoil as it simultaneously weighs the far more consequential case of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose December impeachment over his brief but stunning martial law decree has left the country\u2019s leadership in limbo for months.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the court\u2019s decision and what's ahead:",
      "The prime minister typically holds limited authority as the country\u2019s second-highest official. But Han, a career bureaucrat who has held various government roles since the 1970s, was elevated as the government\u2019s caretaker after South Korea\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14.",
      "Yoon\u2019s impeachment, triggered by his short-lived imposition of martial law that month, immediately suspended his presidential powers and put his political fate in the hands of the Constitutional Court, which is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "As acting president, Han quickly clashed with the liberal opposition Democratic Party, mainly over his refusal to comply with their demand to immediately fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court\u2019s nine-member bench.",
      "The composition of the court is a sensitive issue since removing Yoon from office requires the support of at least six justices, and a full bench would likely increase the chances of his ouster. Han said he wouldn\u2019t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent, but the Democrats accused him of siding with the conservatives in the governing People Power Party, which has been campaigning for Yoon\u2019s return to power.",
      "Days after lawmakers impeached Han on Dec. 27, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who stepped in as acting president, filled two of the court\u2019s vacancies but refused to appoint a progressive justice nominated by the opposition.",
      "Seven of the court\u2019s eight justices overturned or dismissed Han\u2019s impeachment, ruling that the accusations against him were either not illegal, not serious enough to warrant his removal or that the impeachment motion had failed to meet the required quorum when it passed through the National Assembly. One justice upheld Han\u2019s impeachment.",
      "After his reinstatement, Han called for national unity and emphasized the need to focus on addressing external challenges stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies.",
      "Han\u2019s case is unlikely to serve as a preview of how the court will rule on Yoon. Han played no meaningful role in planning or enforcing Yoon\u2019s martial law, which was lifted by a legislative vote just hours after Yoon declared it on the night of Dec. 3.",
      "But Han\u2019s reinstatement still struck a nerve with the Democrats, who have recently criticized the court for its prolonged deliberation on Yoon\u2019s case, which has fueled concerns about a divide among justices, potentially paving the way for Yoon\u2019s return.",
      "Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon, questioned why the court didn\u2019t consider Han\u2019s refusal to appoint the justices an impeachable offense. He said Han\u2019s actions amounted to a \u201cclear and deliberate violation of his constitutional duty to form a government body.\u201d",
      "Lee also called for the court to make a swift decision on Yoon.",
      "Yoon\u2019s office issued a statement welcoming Han\u2019s reinstatement, asserting that the court\u2019s decision proved the opposition\u2019s \u201cexcessive impeachment attempts were reckless, malicious, and politically motivated.\u201d",
      "Yoon, who is also facing a separate criminal trial on rebellion charges, stands accused of abusing military power, bypassing constitutional and legal protocols to impose martial law, and orchestrating a failed attempt to dissolve the legislature. But the Constitutional Court likely won\u2019t take a deep dive into Yoon\u2019s criminal allegations, as it\u2019s only required to rule whether or not he can remain in office.",
      "Some experts say Han\u2019s testimony before lawmakers, investigators and the court regarding the short-lived martial law decree could possibly influence how justices rule on Yoon\u2019s case.",
      "Among the various accusations against Yoon, the National Assembly has alleged that he bypassed a constitutional requirement to deliberate in a formal Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Han\u2019s testimony has seemingly supported these claims.",
      "While Yoon called 11 Cabinet members to his office shortly before declaring martial law on late-night television, Han has said the gathering did not qualify as a formal Cabinet meeting and that Yoon unilaterally informed them of his decision rather than inviting deliberation.",
      "Han and other top officials, including Choi and Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, have said they attempted to talk Yoon out of martial law, citing potential damage to the country\u2019s international reputation and economy. Under South Korea\u2019s constitution, such powers can only be exercised during wartime or comparable national emergencies.",

      "BANGKOK -- Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Monday faced a no-confidence motion in parliament as the opposition alleged she was being unduly influenced by her father, a former prime minister, and is mismanaging the country.",
      "Paetongtarn, who took office last year, is expected to survive her first no-confidence vote on Wednesday with the backing of her ruling coalition that makes up the majority of the House of Representatives.",
      "The head of the opposition in parliament, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, said Paetongtarn had failed to address many of the country\u2019s chronic problems including the slumping economy, air pollution, crimes and corruption. He said her administration was serving the interests of her family and her father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a popular but highly controversial political figure.",
      "Paetongtarn heads the Pheu Thai Party, the latest in a string of populist parties affiliated with Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup, fled into exile and recently returned to Thailand. Thaksin has been at the heart of nearly two decades of deep political divisions pitting a mostly poor, rural majority that supported him against royalists, the military and their urban backers, who accuse him of threatening their status and that of the revered monarchy.",
      "Natthapong is the leader of the People\u2019s Party, a resurrection of the progressive, reformist Move Forward Party, which took the most seats in the general election in 2023 but failed to take power due to strong opposition from the conservative establishment, and was ordered dissolved.",
      "Natthapong said the formation of the ruling coalition, which saw Pheu Thai partner with its former conservative rivals, was part of the political bargain to bring Thaksin home.",
      "Paetongtarn was also accused by Prawit Wongsuwan, head of the Palang Pracharath Party, Pheu Thai\u2019s former coalition partner, of falsely declaring her assets, which she denied.",

      "With such sanctions and a bounty placed on the rebel leaders by Congo\u2019s government, \u201cwe will fight like people who got nothing to lose in order to secure the future of our country,\u201d Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance (AFC) that includes the M23 rebel group, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nangaa also dismissed Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi\u2019s comments last week that his country is looking for a minerals partnership with the U.S. that will bring peace and stability for both countries.",
      "Since launching a major escalation of their decadelong fighting with the Congolese forces in late January, the M23 rebels have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and several towns in eastern Congo, forcing thousands of soldiers to either flee or surrender and prompting fears of regional warfare involving neighbors whose militaries are also on the ground.",

      "\u201cThis problem can be better resolved by the concerned Congolese, not foreigners with different geopolitical agendas,\u201d Nangaa told The AP over the weekend. \u201cTrying to bribe U.S. with mines can undermine U.S. credibility.\u201d",
      "Efforts to achieve a ceasefire collapsed last week after the rebels pulled out from talks being facilitated by Angola, condemning European Union sanctions on its leaders.",
      "Nangaa also rejected the outcome of a meeting between Congolese and Rwandan leaders in Qatar, saying such a move to achieve peace without the group\u2019s involvement would fail and that the rebels can only have a dialogue with Congo\u2019s government if the country acknowledges their grievances and the root causes of the conflict.",
      "\u201cAnything regarding us which are done without us, it\u2019s against us,\u201d Nangaa said.",
      "Despite calls for a ceasefire, M23 rebels have now seized the key town of Walikale that gives them control of a strategic road linking four provinces in eastern Congo \u2014 North Kivu, South Kivu, Tshopo and Maniema \u2014 effectively cutting off Congolese army positions.",
      "In seizing more territories beyond Goma \u2014 the only city they captured during their short-lived uprising in 2012\u2014 the rebels aim to \u201csecure\u201d citizens in those places and fight the root causes of the conflict, the rebel leader said.",
      "The most potent of about 100 armed factions vying for control in eastern Congo, M23 is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who failed to integrate into the Congolese army. The group says it is defending ethnic Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination.",
      "Although U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces supporting the rebels in Congo, Nangaa said the rebel alliance is independent and seeks to address \"the root cause of more than 30 years of instability in our country.\u201d",

      "A media workers union says Turkish authorities detained several journalists from their homes amid escalating protests triggered by the imprisonment of a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "ISTANBUL -- Turkish authorities detained several journalists from their homes, a media workers\u2019 union reported Monday, in what it said was a crackdown amid escalating protests triggered by the imprisonment of the mayor of Istanbul and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "On Sunday, a court formally arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges. His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade and deepened concerns over democracy and the rule of law in the country.",
      "In an apparent escalation of the government\u2019s response to the growing protests, the Disk-Basin-Is union said at least eight reporters and photojournalists were detained in what it said was an \u201cattack on press freedoms and the people\u2019s right to learn the truth.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou cannot hide the truth by silencing journalists!\u201d the union wrote on the social media platform X, calling for their immediate release.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the authorities concerning the detentions.",
      "The mayor\u2019s imprisonment is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials strongly reject the accusations and insist that Turkey\u2019s courts operate independently.",
      "Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging \u2014 accusations he has denied. A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution.",
      "The Interior Ministry later announced that Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a \u201ctemporary measure.\u201d The municipality had previously appointed an acting mayor from its governing council.",
      "The politician was taken to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, as more than 1.7 million members of his opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, held a primary election, endorsing him as its presidential candidate. Millions of non-members also cast votes in a \u201csolidarity ballot,\u201d the party said.",
      "Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul, one of whom was replaced with a government appointee. A further 44 suspects were released under judicial control.",
      "Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president\u2019s Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan\u2019s party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.",
      "The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won.",
      "The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan\u2019s governing party.",

      "The Philippine defense chief has called China\u2019s expansive claims in the South China Sea as \u201cthe biggest fiction and lie\u201d that no Southeast Asian country will accept",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine defense chief on Monday called China's expansive claims in the South China Sea as \u201cthe biggest fiction and lie\u201d that no Southeast Asian country would accept and said that Chinese President Xi Jinping's aggressive policies have undermined the international goodwill fostered by his predecessors.",
      "Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro fired off his latest tirade against China\u2019s increasingly assertive actions in the region on the same day that the Philippine coast guard separately reported new incidents involving Chinese forces in the Scarborough Shoal, a hotly disputed fishing atoll in the disputed waterway.",
      "A Chinese military helicopter appeared to have tailed, but didn't closely approach a Philippine lightplane undertaking a routine patrol on Monday over Scarborough. Chinese forces have separately installed a new floating barrier to prevent Filipino fishermen from entering a lagoon in the shoal, which lies off the northwestern Philippines, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela told an online news briefing.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Chinese officials, but in the past, they have repeatedly asserted that Beijing has had sovereign control over the Scarborough Shoal and most of the South China Sea since ancient times.",
      "An international arbitration panel invalidated China\u2019s expansive claims in a 2016 ruling based on the 1982 U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea, but Beijing refused to participate in the Philippines-initiated arbitration and continues to defy the decision.",
      "In a speech marking the anniversary of the Philippine military\u2019s Western Command on Palawan province, which faces the South China Sea, Teodoro underscored the need for a \u201cstronger national defense posture\u201d and continued security engagement with allied countries to address the threat posed by Chinese aggression in the waterway, a key global trade route.",
      "\"No ASEAN country accepts the legitimacy of that 10-dash line, because that is the biggest fiction and lie that can be sold to any right-thinking person,\u201d Teodoro told Filipino forces.",
      "He was referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation regional bloc that has been negotiating a nonaggression pact called the \u201ccode of conduct\u201d with China to prevent the territorial conflicts from spiraling out of control.",
      "ASEAN state members the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have been involved in the long-simmering territorial standoffs in the South China Sea. Taiwan also lays a claim similar to that of China, which has demarcated the extent of its declared territory with 10 linear dashes on Chinese maps.",
      "Teodoro said that Xi runs a \u201csmall dictatorship and autocracy\u201d and that his \u201cclique\u201d in the Chinese Communist Party is to blame for what the defense chief called Beijing\u2019s aggressive and illegal policies, not Xi's predecessors or the Chinese people.",
      "\"It\u2019s caused by Xi Jinping and his abusive ways \u2026 that would possibly destroy his leadership of his party in China and the goodwill that was nurtured by his predecessors,\u201d Teodoro told reporters.",
      "China\u2019s aggressive actions in the disputed waters have prompted the Philippines to build stronger security alliances with friendly countries, Teodoro said.",
      "The Philippines, he said, would sign a visiting forces agreement with New Zealand next month to allow their forces to enter each other\u2019s territory for joint military exercises. Negotiations have reached the final stage for a similar agreement with Canada, he said.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has authorized the start of negotiations for such an agreement with France, Teodoro said.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is due to meet with Teodoro on Friday in Manila for talks that Philippine officials said would spotlight concerns over China\u2019s assertive actions in the contested waters and ways to strengthen the decades-long U.S.-Philippines treaty alliance.",

      "VIENNA -- Austrian authorities said Monday that they uncovered a Russian-steered campaign aimed at spreading disinformation about Ukraine following the detention in December of a Bulgarian woman accused of spying for Russia.",
      "Austria's domestic intelligence agency unearthed evidence of the operation as it analyzed devices found in a search of the woman's home, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. It said the investigation showed that a few weeks after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a cell working for Russian intelligence was set up and planned a large-scale disinformation campaign in German-speaking countries, particularly Austria.",
      "The group was active online but also used stickers and graffiti with content such as far-right symbols and nationalist statements meant to look like pro-Ukrainian activists were responsible for them, according to the Interior Ministry.",
      "The Bulgarian suspect, whose name wasn't released, is believed to have played a significant role in the effort and acted as an intelligence contact, the ministry said, adding that she has admitted working for the cell, particularly in 2022.",
      "A year ago, Austria's biggest espionage scandal in decades erupted with the arrest of a former Austrian intelligence officer, who was accused among other things of handing over cellphone data of former high-ranking Austrian officials to Russian intelligence and helping plot a burglary at a prominent journalist\u2019s apartment.",
      "The ex-officer, who was later released from custody, is suspected of having provided sensitive information to Jan Marsalek, a fugitive fellow Austrian wanted on suspicion of fraud since the collapse in 2020 of German payment company Wirecard, where he was the chief operating officer.

      "LONDON -- Heathrow bosses on Monday defended their response to a fire that shut down Europe\u2019s busiest air hub for almost a day, after Britain's energy system operator suggested the airport had enough electricity from other sources to keep running.",
      "More than 1,300 flights were canceled on Friday after a fire knocked out one of the three electrical substations that supply Heathrow with power. More than 200,000 passengers had journeys disrupted, and industry experts say the chaos will cost airlines tens of millions of dollars.",
      "The airport reopened after about 18 hours after Heathrow reconfigured its power supply. Heathrow said it ran a full schedule on Saturday and Sunday, with 400,000 passengers passing through on 2,500 weekend flights.",
      "The fire's huge impact raised concern about the resilience of Britain\u2019s energy system to accident, natural disaster or attack. The government has ordered a probe into \u201cany wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Counterterrorism police initially led the investigation into the fire, which came as authorities across Europe gird against sabotage backed by Russia. The head of Britain\u2019s MI6 spy agency has accused Moscow of mounting a \u201cstaggeringly reckless\u201d sabotage campaign against allies of Ukraine in its war against Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "Police say they have found no sign of foul play. The investigation has been handed back to the London Fire Brigade, which said it is focusing on the substation\u2019s electrical distribution equipment.",
      "Meanwhile, the utility company and airport executives are trading blame.",
      "John Pettigrew, chief executive of energy-supply network National Grid, told the Financial Times that \u201ceach substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow\u201d for the airport to stay open.",
      "\u201cLosing a substation is a unique event \u2014 but there were two others available,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that is a level of resilience.\u201d",
      "Heathrow said it had worked to reopen \u201cas soon as safely and practically possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cHundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted,\u201d the airport said in a statement. \u201cGiven Heathrow\u2019s size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge.\u201d",

      "Outside the police station in Voluntari, self-described misogynist Andrew Tate told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m a free person who has not been convicted of anything,\u201d and said he will \u201ccomply with all judicial authorities everywhere around the world because I\u2019m completely innocent.\u201d",
      "The Tates, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, were arrested in Romania in late 2022 and formally indicted last year on charges that they participated in a criminal ring that lured women to Romania, where they were allegedly sexually exploited. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny all of the allegations against them.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re accused of, it matters what you are proven guilty to have done in a fair court of law,\u201d Andrew Tate said on Monday. \u201cAccusations mean nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times you repeat an accusation on the news. That is garbage.\u201d",
      "Early on Saturday, the Tate brothers returned to Romania on a private flight after spending weeks in the U.S., where they flew after a travel ban imposed on them was lifted last month. They remain under judicial control, which requires them to appear before judicial authorities in Romania when summoned.",
      "Days after they arrived in Florida, on March 4, Florida\u2019s Attorney General James Uthmeier said his office had opened a criminal investigation into Andrew and Tristan Tate. He said in a social media post that he directed his office to work with law enforcement to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the brothers.",
      "Andrew Tate on Monday accused Florida's governor of being \"hijacked by the media\" after they arrived in his state. \u201cThe media jumped on him and he didn\u2019t realize I was an American citizen,\u201d he said. \"And now he understands he made a mistake ... there've been some conversations and everything has been settled.\u201d",
      "The lifting of their two-year travel ban came after a Bucharest court in December ruled that a case against the brothers could not go to trial because of multiple legal and procedural irregularities on the part of the prosecutors.",
      "That development was a major victory for the Tate brothers and a blow to Romania\u2019s anti-organized crime agency DIICOT. The case, however, remained open.",
      "Last August, DIICOT also launched a second case against the brothers, investigating allegations of human trafficking, the trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor, influencing statements and money laundering. The Tates have strongly denied those charges as well.",
      "Andrew Tate, 38, a former professional kickboxer who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X, has repeatedly claimed that prosecutors in Romania have no evidence against him and that there is a political conspiracy to silence him.",
      "The Tate brothers\u2019 legal battles are not limited to Romania.",
      "Four British women who accused Andrew Tate of sexual violence and physical abuse are suing him in the U.K. after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute him.",
      "In March last year, the Tate brothers appeared at the Bucharest Court of Appeal in a separate case after U.K. authorities issued arrest warrants over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to the period from 2012 to 2015.",
      "The appeals court granted the U.K. request to extradite the Tates, but only after legal proceedings in Romania have concluded.",

      "The protesters in Belgrade demanded that its former status as a heritage site be restored and that plans for the development project be scrapped. The Serbian government last year approved a multi-million-dollar contract with Kushner to build the complex, including a 99-year lease on the land in the heart of Belgrade.",
      "Monday's rally was part of an anti-corruption movement in Serbia that started after a collapse in November of a concrete canopy at a train station in Serbia's north, which killed 16 people. Critics blamed the crash on government corruption, negligence and disrespect of construction safety rules during renovation.",
      "Monday also marked Remembrance Day for the victims of the 78-day bombing campaign that started on March 24, 1999. Serbs are still angry over the U.S.-led NATO air war, launched to stop Belgrade\u2019s crackdown against separatist ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.",

      "So far, the U.S. has not offered any specifics on the sites it is striking, though Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz claimed the attacks have \u201ctaken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer.\u201d That's something so far that's not been acknowledged by the Houthis, though the rebels have downplayed their losses in the past and exaggerated their attacks attempting to target American warships.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve hit their headquarters,\" Waltz told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \"We\u2019ve hit communications nodes, weapons factories and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities.\u201d",
      "An apparent U.S. strike Sunday hit a building in a western neighborhood of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, killing at least one person and wounding 13 others, the rebel-controlled SABA news agency said, citing health officials. Footage released by the rebels showed the rubble of a collapsed building and pools of blood staining the gray dust covering the ground.",
      "A building next to the collapsed structure still stood, suggesting American forces likely used a lower-yield warhead in the strike.",
      "The Houthis also described American airstrikes targeting sites around the city of Saada, a Houthi stronghold, the Red Sea port city of Hodeida and Marib province, home to oil and gas fields still under the control of allies to Yemen's exiled central government.",
      "The campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 53 people immediately after they began March 15, started after the Houthis threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\" ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels in the past have had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.",
      "The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none have been hit so far.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis\u2019 profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen\u2019s decadelong stalemated war that\u2019s torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",

      "HALTERN AM SEE, Germany -- Victims' relatives traveled to the scene in the French Alps of the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 10 years ago Monday, while hundreds of people gathered in silence to mark the anniversary in a German town that was home to an 18-member school group on board the doomed plane.",
      "The plane took off from Barcelona, Spain on the morning of March 24, 2015, and was supposed to land in Duesseldorf, Germany. But it never arrived because, investigators said, the plane was deliberately downed by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz. All 150 people on board were killed.",
      "The victims included a group of 16 students and two teachers from a high school in the western German town of Haltern am See who were flying home from an exchange trip to Spain.",
      "Also killed were two babies, a pair of acclaimed German opera singers and a member of an Argentine rock band, three generations of the same family, a vacationing mother and son, a recently married couple, people on business trips and others going home. Most came from Germany and Spain, though the victims came from 17 different countries in total.",
      "Many victims' families traveled to the crash site in southeastern France. In the nearby village of Le Vernet, local officials and Carsten Spohr, the chief executive of Germanwings parent Lufthansa, laid flowers.",
      "In Haltern, students laid roses in the yard of the Joseph K\u00f6nig high school, and hundreds of people who gathered in the rain in front of a plaque with the victims' names fell silent at 10:41 a.m., the moment of the crash.",
      "The school's principal, Christian Krahl, said it remains important to remember the tragedy even though today's students didn't experience it, German news agency dpa reported. \u201cWe want to be close to those who are infinitely sad to this day,\u201d he said.",
      "Wreaths were laid at the town cemetery, where there is a memorial in the form of a schoolroom and some of the students are buried.",
      "Commemorations were also planned at the airports in Duesseldorf and Barcelona. At Duesseldorf Airport, a book of condolences was available in the so-called Room of Silence for employees and travelers.",
      "The crash caused shock and disbelief when investigators revealed that co-pilot Lubitz locked the flight\u2019s captain out of the cockpit to deliberately set the plane on a collision course with a mountainside.",
      "Lubitz had in the past suffered from depression, but authorities and his airline later deemed him fit to fly. In the months ahead of the crash, Lubitz suffered from sleeplessness and feared losing his vision, but he hid that from his employer.",
      "\u201cThis state of shock, the deeply felt sympathy of all the residents for the families and the question of why this happened are still with us today,\u201d Haltern Mayor Andreas Stegemann told dpa.",

    "story": [
      "South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo has been reinstated as the acting president as the Constitutional Court overturned his impeachment",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating the nation's No. 2 official as acting leader Monday while not yet ruling on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol over his shocking imposition of martial law late in December.",
      "Many observers said the 7-1 ruling in Han's case did not signal much about the upcoming verdict on Yoon, as Han wasn\u2019t a key figure in imposing martial law. But the ruling could still embolden Yoon\u2019s staunch supporters and ramp up their political offensive on the opposition.",
      "Speaking with reporters following his reinstatement, Han thanked the court for what he called \u201ca wise decision\u201d and promised to focus on tackling \u201curgent matters,\u201d including a fast-changing global trade environment, in an apparent reference to the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive tariffs policy. He also called for national unity, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no left or right \u2014 what matters is the advancement of our nation.\u201d",
      "South Korea has been thrown into huge political turmoil, since Yoon, a conservative, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and sent hundreds of troops to the liberal-controlled National Assembly and other places in Seoul. Yoon's decree lasted only six hours as enough lawmakers managed to enter an assembly hall and voted it down quickly.",
      "The assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, alleging he violated the constitution and other laws by suppressing assembly activities and trying to detain politicians. Yoon's impeachment made Han acting president until he was impeached in late December.",
      "The unprecedented, successive impeachments that suspended the country\u2019s top two officials intensified domestic division and deepened worries about the country\u2019s diplomatic and economic activities.",
      "Han, who attempted to reassure diplomatic partners and stabilize markets during his time as acting president, was accused in the impeachment motion of abetting Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration and obstructing efforts to restore the Constitutional Court\u2019s full membership and investigate Yoon\u2019s alleged rebellion.",
      "The nine-member court at the time had three vacancies, but ousting Yoon would require support from at least six justices. After Han was suspended, his successor as acting president, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant.",
      "Seven of the Constitutional Court's eight justices ruled to overturn or dismiss Han's impeachment. They ruled the accusations against him weren\u2019t against the law or weren\u2019t serious enough to remove him from office or his impeachment motion didn't even met a required quorum when it passed thorough the assembly. One justice upheld Han\u2019s impeachment.",
      "The Democratic Party expressed regret over the court\u2019s decision to reinstate Han and urged it to dismiss Yoon's case quickly. Yoon\u2019s office welcomed Monday\u2019s ruling, saying it shows again the opposition\u2019s abuse of impeachment motions were \u201creckless, malicious political offensive.\u201d",
      "Observers earlier had predicted the Constitutional Court would rule on Yoon\u2019s case in mid-March, but it hasn\u2019t done so, sparking varied speculation on possible reasons.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s verdict will give hope to Yoon\u2019s supporters for a similar fate and hope for Yoon\u2019s opponents for his ouster,\u201d said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cBut it\u2019s too soon to predict the court\u2019s verdict on Yoon because the specific details of both cases and allegations are different.\u201d",
      "Kim said the the reinstatement of Han, a career bureaucrat, will bring more stability to South Korea compared to when his powers as acting president were suspended.",
      "Massive rival rallies backing Yoon or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea. Earlier surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans were critical of Yoon\u2019s martial law enactment, but those supporting or sympathizing with Yoon have later gained strength.",
      "Yoon argues that his martial law introduction was a desperate attempt to bring attention to the \u201cwickedness\u201d of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party which obstructed his agenda and filed many impeachment motions against senior officials. Yoon critics counter he likely tried to use military rule to frustrate possible special investigations into scandals involving him and his wife.",
      "Senior military and police officers sent to the assembly have said that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent a floor vote to overturn his decree. Yoon says the troops' deployment was designed to maintain order.",
      "If the court upholds Yoon\u2019s impeachment, South Korea must hold a presidential election to choose his successor. If it rules for him, Yoon will regain his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon has separately been charged with rebellion in connection with his martial law decree, a charge that carries the death penalty or a life sentence if he is convicted.",

    "story": [
      "Over 12 years, Francis has sought to normalize the papacy with his informal style and disdain for pomp while still wielding the awesome power of the papacy",
      "VATICAN CITY -- During his first foreign trip in 2013, Pope Francis made headlines when he carried his own black leather briefcase as he boarded the Alitalia charter bound for Brazil, since popes never carry bags and until the 1970s were themselves carried on thrones.",
      "Asked what was in the bag, Francis joked that it wasn\u2019t the nuclear codes. But he seemed baffled that something as normal as an airplane passenger carrying a briefcase could create such a fuss.",
      "\u201cI have always taken a bag with me when travelling \u2013 it\u2019s normal,\u201d he told his first news conference as pope. \u201cWe must get used to being normal. The normality of life.\u201d",
      "Over 12 years, Francis has sought that kind of normality for the papacy with his informal style and disdain for pomp while ensuring that he still wields the awesome power held by Christ\u2019s vicar on Earth and Europe\u2019s last absolute monarch.",
      "The way Francis has managed his five-week hospitalization for pneumonia has followed that same playbook: He has allowed the public to follow the very normal ups and downs of an 88-year-old man battling a complex lung infection through spare but regular medical bulletins, while also continuing to run the 1.3-billion strong Catholic Church.",
      "In between respiratory crises, prayer and physiotherapy, Francis has appointed over a dozen bishops, approved a handful of new saints, authorized a three-year extension of his signature reform process and sent off messages public and private. Vatican cardinals have stood in for him at events requiring his presence.",
      "That\u2019s not as easy a balancing act as it sounds, since there are few positions of power that are both as absolute as the papacy and, during times of illness, as seemingly fragile: According to the church's canon law, the pope possesses \u201csupreme, full, immediate, and universal ordinary power in the church.\" He answers to no one but God, and there is no appeal of his decisions.",
      "And while popes aren\u2019t subject to re-election campaigns or no-confidence votes, they essentially owe their jobs to the 120 men who elected them. While those same cardinals swear obedience to the pope, they will ultimately choose his successor from within their own ranks. It's no surprise then that talk of conclaves, papal contenders and challenges facing a future pope has been a constant buzz in Rome ever since Francis was admitted to Gemelli hospital Feb. 14.",
      "Francis is well aware that anytime he has gone into the hospital, the plotting has begun for electing the next pope, contributing to a certain lame duck status. \u201cSome wanted me dead,\u201d he said after his 2021 hospitalization, when he learned that secret meetings had already been held to plan the conclave. He knows as well that even before his current hospitalization, an anonymous cardinal had circulated a seven-point memo listing priorities for the next pope to correct the \u201cconfusion, division and conflict\u201d sowed by Francis.",
      "And yet Francis has never been shy about showing his weaknesses, age or infirmities in ways that seem unthinkable for public figures for whom any sign of fragility can threaten their authority and undermine their agenda.",
      "Within months of being elected, for example, Francis reached out to an Argentine doctor and journalist, Dr. Nelson Castro, and suggested he write a book about the health of popes, himself included.",
      "\u201cMy hypothesis is that he wanted first of all to show himself as a human being,\u201d Castro said in an interview. \u201cWe tend to see popes like saints, but the way he talked about his diseases showed me, \u2018I\u2019m like you and me, being exposed to diseases.\u2019\u201d",
      "Francis had read and appreciated Castro\u2019s earlier book, \u201cThe Sickness of Power,\u201d about the ailments that have afflicted Argentina\u2019s leaders and how power itself had afflicted them. He invited Castro to research and write about past popes and his own case in a similar light.",
      "\u201cThe Health of Popes\u201d was published in 2021. Castro said what struck him most was that Francis disclosed not only his physical ailments, but his mental health challenges too: Francis revealed that he had gone to a psychiatrist when he was the Jesuit provincial during Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s to help him cope with fear and anxiety.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a man of power,\u201d Castro said. \u201cOnly a man of power, feeling quite sure of himself, would dare to talk about his diseases so openly.\u201d",
      "For the Rev. John Cecero, who was Jesuit provincial for the northeast United States from 2014-2020, Francis\u2019 willingness to show his weaknesses while exercising supreme authority is consistent with his Jesuit training and the biblical teaching of St. Paul that \u201cwhen I am weak, then I am strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cA chief virtue on the part of everyone in the practice of Jesuit authority is humility,\" Cecero said in an interview. \"On the part of the individual Jesuit (that means) thinking beyond my own self-interest to the common good.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s something that drives Francis: that you have that same humility,\u201d he said.",
      "And yet Francis\u2019 critics often complain that he\u2019s authoritarian, that he takes decisions in a vacuum and without regard to the law, and wields power like a \u201cDictator Pope,\u201d the title of a book written by a traditionalist critic early in Francis\u2019 papacy.",
      "Many recite the joke about the way Jesuit superiors exercise power, which is supposed to be a process of joint discernment between the superior and the underling but, the joke goes, it can be anything but: \u201cI discern, you discern, we discern \u2026 I decide.\u201d",
      "Those same conservative critics, of course, have been keenly watching Francis\u2019 hospitalization and wondering if the end of his papacy is near.",
      "Even if he is absent, and even if he has to cut back his public activities going forward, Francis is very much still in power and leading the church, said Kurt Martens, a canon lawyer at Catholic University of America in Washington D.C.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re used to seeing a pope who is everywhere all the time,\" he said. \"But don't forget that in the past, not that long ago, popes would show up only rarely.\u201d",
      "Francis' disappearance from public view has led some to doubt the authenticity of the first, and so far only photograph of Francis released by the Vatican since his hospitalization. It was shot from behind and showed Francis at prayer in his private hospital chapel, his face hidden.",
      "Avvenire, the newspaper of the Italian bishops\u2019 conference, said the photo was not only real but showed Francis controlling the image that he wants the faithful to have of the papacy and his illness. Francis wants viewers to focus not on the spectacle of a sick pope, but on what should actually matter more to a Catholic anyway.",
      "\u201cIf we cannot see his face ... what we must look at is precisely what he himself is facing: the altar and the crucifix,\u201d Avvenire wrote.",

      "POINT ROBERTS, Wash. -- In the northwest corner of Washington state lies a quirky U.S. exclave so dependent on Canada\u2019s goodwill that the strain of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war is inescapable \u2014 in the sole grocery store, at any of the three eateries, and for the many residents who never voted for him.",
      "Locals and visitors alike in Point Roberts, Washington, are increasingly worried about how this unusual waterfront border town that has embodied the two countries\u2019 interdependency can survive the hostility brewing on both sides.",
      "\u201cThis was really devastating,\u201d said Tamra Hansen, a longtime Point Roberts resident and business owner whose eyes welled with tears as she described her two restaurants on the brink. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the support from the Canadians, this town will die.\u201d",
      "Known as a geographic oddity since the boundary with Canada was drawn in 1846, this detached 5-square-mile community \u2014 called an exclave because it\u2019s completely separated from mainland America \u2014 is surrounded by water on three sides. Its only land connection is to Canada and it takes one border crossing and about 25 miles north by car to get to downtown Vancouver, B.C.; or two border crossings and about 25 miles through Canada to re-enter the United States along Boundary Bay.",
      "The beaches, marina, golf course and hiking trails have long made Point Roberts a cherished getaway destination, but today locals say business has never been worse. Canadian visitors are staying away and some American residents say they\u2019ve even been harassed over their nationality.",
      "Point Roberts Fire Chief Christopher Carleton said Point Roberts is one the last remaining untouched natural gems of the United States, but the tight-knit community with no stop lights is now under threat by politicians who know nothing about their way of life.",
      "\u201cWe need to take care of one another and have grace for one another and not allow people who don\u2019t even know we exist to disrupt the relationships we currently have,\u201d said Carleton, whose firefighters mostly live across the border.",
      "Tensions between the U.S. and Canada have spiked to a level not seen before in modern times thanks to Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again threat over the past two months to place taxes on a long list of goods going across the border. In response, Canada has promised retaliatory tariffs.",
      "For a population that has famously prided itself on being nice, polite and loyal allies, Canadians aren\u2019t hiding their disgust for Trump\u2019s polarizing rhetoric, especially taking offense with the U.S. president\u2019s claim that Canada could be the \u201c 51st state.\u201d",
      "Mark Nykolaichuk said he refuses to go to the mainland U.S. but describes Point Roberts as a unique exception because the border here has never felt like an actual divide for Canadians like him who grew up visiting.",
      "Most of the property owners here are from Canada, and many of the 1,000 year-round residents have dual citizenship. Once a booming fishing town, the leading industry now, according to U.S. Census data, is retail \u2014 primarily driven from tourism because of the number of vacation properties. The unincorporated Whatcom County community is now mostly home to retirees, though this year there are seven students \u2014 nicknamed \u201cThe Borderites\" \u2014 at the lone public school.",
      "Nykolaichuk, who lives in the Vancouver, B.C. area, said he hopes he can help keep the Point Roberts International Marketplace open by shopping there, given that management reports business is down 20% to 30%. He depends on Point Roberts\u2019 only grocery store to be able to cook at his vacation home because U.S. customs doesn\u2019t permit raw meat to enter its borders, for example, so he must buy it in town.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to see this place shut down,\u201d Nykolaichuk said. \u201cIf this place goes, where are the U.S. citizens going to eat? Where are they going to get their food from?\u201d",
      "Many in Point Roberts don\u2019t blame the Canadians for their disdain over Trump\u2019s perceived sovereignty threat. Instead, there\u2019s a deep sadness for both sides.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve always gotten along and it\u2019s just nonsensical because now the U.S. is going to suffer too,\u201d said Hansen, who is a dual citizen. \u201cI definitely feel for the Canadian people at this time because they\u2019ve got their backs against the wall, really, and they have to retaliate.\u201d",
      "Like many locals, Larry Musselwhite, owner of Larry\u2019s Liquor Locker, is angry at Trump and blames the president for Point Roberts\u2019 economic problems. The 75-year-old said he can\u2019t even think about retiring right now because of the economy. His liquor store was down 40% in sales last month.",
      "\u201cThis is because of our elected president, who really doesn\u2019t care about the common man and the struggles that we have to go through,\u201d Musselwhite said. \u201cIt greatly affects how I live my life.\u201d",
      "About 75% of the Point Roberts precinct voted for a presidential candidate other than Trump, which is a higher percentage than across Whatcom County as well as the statewide turnout, according to the 2024 election results.",
      "Locals say one of the most frustrating things about the tit-for-tat is the way that the tariffs have abruptly started and stopped, creating an unsteady flow of changes to customs. The whiplash for residents who often cross the border multiple times a day leaves them unsure whether or when they\u2019ll be surprised with a new penalty.",
      "This fear over unexpected tariff fees has made people cautious about buying things in Point Roberts \u2014 if they\u2019re coming into town at all.",
      "Hugh Wilson, a real estate agent who also manages several local Airbnb listings, said properties have seen more cancellations than bookings lately.",
      "\u201cNobody is sure of the rules at any one day here,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe border agents do the best they can to stay up to date and they relay that to us as normal people crossing the border.\u201d",
      "With no end in sight, there\u2019s also a high-stakes fear that the dispute could escalate with Canada possibly imposing tariffs on the water and electricity that it supplies to Point Roberts, or even turning off the utilities altogether.",
      "\u201cIf it gets more brutal, they can cut off the water just like that, or the power,\u201d said Brian Calder, a fourth-generation resident who was previously the president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce. \u201cAnd it just depends how much more confrontation is fomented by Trump\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Calder said he and other town leaders are trying to plead for help with the British Columbia premier and the governor of Washington state. He said the local Whatcom County leadership has all but abandoned this far-away community in a time of crisis.",
      "Jed Holmes, a spokesman for the county, said they are communicating with Washington state's congressional delegation in D.C. to address the rapid deterioration in U.S.-Canada relations that has especially affected Point Roberts.",
      "\u201cI understand that folks want us to do more, but it\u2019s really challenging to identify what meaningful things a county government can do to change this dynamic at the international level,\u201d Holmes said in an email.",
      "For Hansen, she\u2019s asking herself how much more can she afford to lose personally while running the Saltwater Cafe breakfast spot and a restaurant called The Pier. She has 15 employees to pay but business was down 55% in February compared with last year. There have been times when her pub doesn\u2019t even net $100 a day.",
      "\u201cThere are some businesses that are going out of business right now as we speak,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional for me because I care about everybody that lives here.\u201d",

      "This year, scammers might take particular advantage of uncertainty stemming from recent workforce cuts impacting thousands of jobs at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. These layoffs and the potential for even more widespread reductions also raise questions about resources, including the IRS's bandwidth to respond to scams reported by consumers.",
      "Here's what to know about tax scams and how to stay safe:",
      "Tax scammers may try to reach you in a number of different ways \u2014 from lookalike emails, texts or phone calls impersonating the IRS to unsolicited social media offers that promise a suspiciously high refund. But there are a handful of common red flags to keep an eye out for, including:",

      "\u2014 Isolation tactics or threats",
      "\u2014 Promises of a big payday",
      "\u2014 Suspicious website links",
      "Cybersecurity experts stress that scammers prey on emotion \u2014 and will often try to evoke fear or uncertainty. Many tax scams will ask you to act fast or click on a malicious link right away. Others will make you think you did something wrong, going as far as threatening an arrest if you don't respond. Scammers may also isolate you from contacting others, such as a trusted accounting professional or even a family member.",

Some \"ghost\u201d preparers, for example, will charge you for preparing your tax return \u2014 often with promises of maximizing your refund \u2014 but never sign it. They may then file a fraudulent return in your name, with an inflated income or fake deductions to boost the refund, and switch the bank account listed to claim your money.",
      "The IRS will never initiate contact via email, text or social media with requests for your personal information \u2014 and urges consumers to only use trusted, accredited tax professionals if you need help preparing your return. Those who have fallen victim to scams are also encouraged to report them. You can find more information on the agency's official website.",
      "Tax scams can be all the more convincing if they meet the moment. And this year, experts warn that cyber criminals or \u201csocial engineers\u201d might take particular advantage of uncertainty around the IRS cuts.",
      "\u201cUncertainty is probably one of the biggest motivating emotions that social engineers take advantage of,\u201d said Dave Chronister, a prominent \u201cethical hacker\u201d and CEO of Parameter Security, noting that scammers might use news of these cuts and impersonate the IRS to falsely promise taxpayers \u201cnew\u201d ways of filing.",
      "Similar tactics emerged during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and following legitimate rounds of federal aid \u2014 with some scammers making false claims about additional stimulus checks, for example.",
      "All it takes is just \u201ca little bit of common knowledge\u201d to \u201cnudge you\u201d into trusting them, Chronister explains.",
      "Beyond how scammers use the news, the IRS workforce cuts could slow the agency's ability to actually respond to scams, Chronister and others note. As a result, malicious websites or predatory social media campaigns may not be taken down as quickly \u2014 and victims of fraudulent returns could have to wait longer for answers.",
      "\u201cThere is potential for reduced oversight,\u201d said Chris Pierson, chief executive of cybersecurity firm BlackCloak. \u201cIf you have less individuals to be proactive within an agency that is housing, I mean, an amazing treasure trove of data and information \u2014 that obviously is concerning ... (and could) create a riskier environment for the consumer.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment, the IRS pointed to its \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d list of common tax scams to watch out for this year, among other steps taxpayers can take to protect themselves from identity theft and fraud. But the agency did not immediately comment on whether recent or future workforce cuts would impact its enforcement resources.",
      "Scams are also becoming more sophisticated, most recently thanks to the rising adoption of generative artificial intelligence. Experts warn that this technology is being used create \u201chyper-realistic\u201d phishing messages, including video or audio deepfakes, and can allow scammers to target more people at once through automation.",
      "Pierson also warns of the fallout from recent high-profile data breaches \u2014 including the National Public Data breach, which made headlines last year for reportedly leaking a massive amount of sensitive information on the dark web, including full names, social security numbers, contact information and mailing addresses. Having that information out there could lead to more fraudulent filings, he explains, or \u201cconfidence scams\" \u2014 where cyber criminals share one piece of information they have, like an address, to get people to trust them and share more.",
      "File as soon as you can.",
      "Nobody is eager to sit down and do their taxes, but getting it out of the way early \u2014 and before any scammers potentially try to file something in your name \u2014 makes a huge difference, Chronister explains. He adds that taxpayers can play it safe by sticking to what they know.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve always been using TurboTax, use TurboTax. If you always use an accountant, use your accountant,\" Chronister said. He notes that you should also keep your information safe by password-protecting any past filings downloaded to your device and using a VPN when on public Wi-Fi.",
      "The IRS also suggests setting up an identity protection PIN, a six-digit number that can help protect you from someone else filing in your name. You can also freeze your credit \u2014 which experts recommend as an added line of defense against future identity theft and fraud, even if you haven't been scammed. Freezing your credit prevents any new credit accounts from being created in your name. And you can always temporarily \u201cunfreeze\u201d if a check is needed to rent an apartment or apply for a loan. Credit freezes can be set up through three nationwide credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.",
      "And, again, remember that the IRS won't randomly contact you by email, text or phone. When in doubt, go to the official IRS website and reach out directly.",
      "Avoiding scams can also come down to pausing before you click or act on anything. \u201cTake a breath, count to 10 and then go, \u2018OK ... is this too good to be true?'\" Chronister sad. \"'Is my gut telling me something is off?'\u201d",
      "Chronister adds that social engineering is about emotion, not intelligence \u2014 and anyone can fall for it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s human to fall for these (scams),\" he said. \"They\u2019ve been here since the beginning of mankind ... So you have to stay vigilant, but don\u2019t panic. Just keep your gut check going.\u201d",

      "The fire's huge impact raised concern about the resilience of Britain\u2019s energy system to accidents, natural disasters or attacks. The government has ordered an investigation into \u201cany wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Counterterrorism police initially led the investigation into the fire, which came as authorities across Europe gird against sabotage backed by Russia. The head of Britain\u2019s MI6 spy agency has accused Moscow of mounting a \u201cstaggeringly reckless\u201d sabotage campaign against allies of Ukraine, which has been trying to repel Russia's full-scale invasion for more than three years.",
      "Police say they have found \u201cno indication of any foul play,\u201d and the London Fire Brigade said that it's leading the investigation, which is focused on the substation\u2019s electrical distribution equipment.",
      "Gareth Bacon, the transport spokesman of the opposition Conservative Party, said that \"malicious actors ... will undoubtedly have taken note of this weekend\u2019s events.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis episode underlines the urgent need to ensure that our critical infrastructure is safeguarded against both accidental incident and deliberate acts of sabotage by malign actors,\u201d he said in the House of Commons.",
      "Meanwhile, the utility company and airport executives are trading blame.",
      "John Pettigrew, chief executive of energy-supply network National Grid, told the Financial Times that \u201ceach substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow\u201d for the airport to stay open.",
      "\u201cLosing a substation is a unique event \u2014 but there were two others available,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that is a level of resilience.\u201d",

      "\u201cHundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted,\u201d the airport said in a statement. \u201cGiven Heathrow\u2019s size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge.\u201d",
      "Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye is also facing questions about why he put the airport\u2019s chief operating officer, Javier Echave, in charge of decision-making as the fire raged early Friday.",

      "Bayer must pay damages to a man who says Roundup weed killer caused his cancer.",
      "NEW YORK -- A jury in Georgia has ordered Monsanto parent Bayer to pay nearly $2.1 billion in damages to a man who says the company's Roundup weed killer caused his cancer, according to attorneys representing the plaintiff.",
      "The verdict marks the latest in a long-running series of court battles Monsanto has faced over its Roundup herbicide. The agrochemical giant says it will appeal the verdict, reached in a Georgia courtroom late Friday, in efforts to overturn the decision.",
      "The penalties awarded include $65 million in compensatory damages and $2 billion in punitive damages, law firms Arnold & Itkin LLP and Kline & Specter PC said in a statement. That marks one of the largest legal settlements reached in a Roundup-related case to date.",
      "Plaintiff John Barnes filed his lawsuit against Monsanto in 2021, seeking damages related to his non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Arnold & Itkin attorney Kyle Findley, the lead trial lawyer on the case, said the verdict will help put his client in a better position to get the treatment he needs going forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road for him ... and he was happy that the truth related to the product (has) been exposed,\u201d Findley told The Associated Press on Sunday. He called the verdict an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d after \"another example of Monsanto\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for poisoning people with this toxic product.\u201d",
      "Germany-based Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in 2018, has continued to dispute claims that Roundup causes cancer. But the company has been hit with more than 177,000 lawsuits involving the weedkiller and set aside $16 billion to settle cases.",
      "In a statement, Monsanto said Friday's verdict \u201cconflicts with the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and the consensus of regulatory bodies and their scientific assessments worldwide.\u201d The company added that it continues \u201cto stand fully behind the safety\u201d of Roundup products.",
      "For a variety of crops \u2014 including corn, soybeans and cotton \u2014 Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist the weedkiller\u2019s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less.",
      "Some studies associate Roundup\u2019s key ingredient, glyphosate, with cancer, although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. Still, numerous lawsuits over the weedkiller allege glyphosate does cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma, arguing that Monsanto has failed to warn the public about serious risks for years.",
      "Findley said that evidence relating to Barnes' case show \u201cmany years of cover-ups\" and \u201cbackroom dealings.\u201d He accused Monsanto of ignoring several scientific studies related to the toxicity of Roundup and said the company \u201ctried to find ways to persuade and distract and deny the connection between this product and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\u201d",
      "Friday's decision marks the fourth Roundup-related verdict that Findley's team has won to date \u2014 the largest of which was awarded in Philadelphia in January 2024, with damages totaling $2.25 billion. And he said his law firm has \u201cmany more clients who are similarly situated as Mr. Barnes.\u201d",
      "Monsanto, meanwhile, also maintains that it \u201cremains committed to trying cases\u201d \u2014 and argues its wider record of Roundup-related litigation continues to reinforce the safety of its products. The company said it has prevailed in 17 of the last 25 related trials, while some previous damage awards have been reduced.",
      "Bayer has recently renewed and expanded an effort across a handful of U.S. states to protect pesticide companies from claims they failed to warn that a product causes cancer, if labeling otherwise complies with EPA regulations. The company and other industry supports argue that litigation costs are unstainable and could impact Roundup\u2019s future availability. But opponents stress that such legislation would limit accountability.",

      "Dozens of independent pharmacies have shuttered in Alabama over the last two years, according to the Alabama Independent Pharmacy Alliance. Pharmacists said that is because of financial pressures, in part, because it can often cost more to dispense a drug than they are reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers.",

      "Alabama is one of several states considering new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen between health insurance companies, drug companies and pharmacies. The Alabama Senate voted 32-0 Thursday to advance legislation to require minimum reimbursement rates to community pharmacists. The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives.",
      "Legislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. Both large retail chains and independent pharmacists have closed stores across the country as drugstores face reimbursement issues, rising costs and other challenges.",
      "Pharmacy benefit managers leverage purchasing power with drug companies with the goal of driving down drug costs for consumers. However, independent pharmacists say the business practices of benefit managers cause them to lose money on about 20% of prescriptions.",
      "\u201cThe biggest issue is we\u2019re not getting paid what it actually cost to fill a prescription, including labor,\u201d Trent McLemore, a pharmacist with Star Discount Pharmacy.",
      "The Alabama bill would require that PBMs reimburse community pharmacies at the Alabama Medicaid Agency reimbursement rate. It would also prohibit the practice of \u201cspread pricing\u201d where a benefits manager charges health plans more for drugs than they pay pharmacies.",
      "Groups opposed to the bill have said it would effectively put a new $10.64 fee on prescriptions under the requirement to match state Medicaid rates, which include a $10.64 dispensing fee. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses.",

      "\u201cTo minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, we\u2019re making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it,\u201d said Werfel.",
      "If you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit you don\u2019t have to take any action. The IRS plans to send letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment. The payments will go out automatically this month and should arrive by direct deposit or check by late January. They\u2019ll be sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayer\u2019s 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file.",
      "You still might be able to receive the money. However, taxpayers need to file a tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit by the April 15, 2025 deadline, even if any income from a job, business or other source was minimal or nonexistent, according to the IRS.",
      "There were three rounds of payments to households impacted by the pandemic, totaling $814 billion. IRS based the amounts that taxpayers received on their income, tax filing status and number of children or qualifying dependents.",
      "In March 2020, eligible individuals received up to $1,200 per income tax filer and $500 per child under the CARES Act. In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In March 2021, eligible individuals received up to $1,400 per income tax filer and $1,400 per child under the American Rescue Plan Act.",

    "story": [
      "Turkey's opposition party has urged supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "ISTANBUL -- The leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition on Friday renewed a call on supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even as authorities widened a ban on protests and criticized the appeal as irresponsible.",
      "Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.",
      "Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.",
      "Cumhuriyet newspaper and other media reported that police began questioning Imamoglu on Friday afternoon. The mayor can be detained without charges for up to four days.",
      "Erdogan said that the government wouldn't tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of being associated with corruption, marginal groups and terrorist organizations.",
      "\u201cWe see that an anti-corruption operation in Istanbul is being used as an excuse to stir unrest in our streets. I want it to be known that we will not allow a handful of opportunists to bring unrest to Turkey just to protect their plundering schemes,\u201d Erdogan said.",
      "\u201cPointing to the streets instead of courtrooms to defend theft, plunder, lawlessness and fraud is a grave irresponsibility,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cJust as we have not surrendered to street terrorism until now, we will not bow to vandalism in the future either.\u201d",
      "Since Imamoglu\u2019s arrest, thousands of people have gathered at Istanbul\u2019s city hall for nighttime rallies, and clashes have erupted between demonstrators and police in Istanbul, Turkish capital Ankara and Turkey\u2019s third-largest city, Izmir.",
      "The most violent clash took place at Ankara\u2019s Middle East Technical University late Thursday, when police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration. Students said that rubber bullets were used, but the government has denied that.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that more than 50 people were detained, and 16 police officers were injured, following the protests.",
      "On Friday, authorities in Ankara and Izmir announced a five-day prohibition on demonstrations, following a similar ban imposed earlier by the Istanbul governor's office. The bans came after the country\u2019s justice minister acknowledged people\u2019s right to demonstrate, but said that street protests amid ongoing judicial investigations were unacceptable.",
      "Still, Ozgur Ozel, the chairman of the Republican People\u2019s Party, CHP, made a new appeal for people to gather and demonstrate.",
      "\u201cI invite tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions to peacefully demonstrate, express our democratic reaction, and exercise our constitutional rights,\u201d he said.",
      "Ozel said: \u201cTo those who say that calling people to the streets is irresponsible, I say this: We are not the ones filling these streets and squares. It is your lawlessness and injustices that have brought people out.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.",
      "The CHP has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday \u2014 through ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey \u2014 to show solidarity with Imamoglu.",
      "Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a \u201ctrustee mayor,\u201d if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.",
      "Meanwhile, Ozel announced that the CHP has decided to hold an extraordinary party congress on April 6, to thwart an alleged attempt by the authorities to appoint a \u201ctrustee chairman\u201d to lead the party. The decision came amid speculation that the authorities may be seeking to annul the party\u2019s last congress held in 2023 over alleged vote-buying and other irregularities, and appoint a handpicked leader.",
      "On Friday, the Borsa Istanbul's benchmark index dropped by around 7%, prompting temporary trading suspensions aimed at preventing panic-driven sell-offs.",

      "The lawsuit filed late Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington describes the lengths that institute staff resorted to, including calling the police, in an effort to prevent DOGE representatives and others working with the Trump administration from accessing the headquarters near the State Department.",
      "An executive order last month from Republican President Donald Trump targeted the institute and three other agencies for large-scale reductions. The think tank, which seeks to prevent and resolve conflicts, was created and funded by Congress in 1984. Board members are nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate.",

      "In his place, the three appointed Kenneth Jackson, an administrator with the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the lawsuit.",

      "In a federal court filing late Tuesday, Ben & Jerry\u2019s said Unilever informed its board on March 3 that it was removing and replacing Ben & Jerry\u2019s CEO David Stever. Ben & Jerry\u2019s said that violated its merger agreement with Unilever, which states that any decisions regarding a CEO\u2019s removal must come after a consultation with an advisory committee from Ben & Jerry\u2019s board.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with London-based Unilever on Wednesday.",
      "Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry\u2019s in 2000 for $326 million. At the time, Ben & Jerry\u2019s said the partnership would help the progressive Vermont-based ice cream company expand its social mission.",
      "But lately, the marriage hasn\u2019t been a happy one. In 2021, Ben & Jerry's announced it would stop serving Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and contested east Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli business to a local company that said it would sell Ben & Jerry's under its Hebrew and Arabic name throughout Israel and the West Bank.",
      "Last May, Unilever said it was planning to spin off its ice cream business \u2014 including Ben & Jerry's \u2014 by the end of 2025 as part of a larger restructuring. Unilever also owns personal hygiene brands like Dove soap and food brands like Hellmann's mayonnaise.",

Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.",
      "In Trump\u2019s first term, his properties in New York City, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.",
      "\u201cTesla is an easy target,\u201d said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \u201cThey\u2019re rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\u201d",

An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.",

In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.",
      "Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.",
      "In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \u201cresist\u201d was also painted in red across the building\u2019s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.",

It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\u201d Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \u201cNone of those factors are lost on us.\u201d",
      "Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn\u2019t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.",
      "More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.",
      "Musk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Trump\u2019s adviser.",
      "Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump\u2019s election but has since shed all those gains.",
      "Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s podcast, saying \u201cat least some of it is organized and paid for\u201d by \u201cleftwing organizations in America, funded by leftwing billionaires, essentially.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d",
      "The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \u201cMusk Or Us\u201d protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \u201cit explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\u201d",

      "Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla\u2019s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.",
      "The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of the administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump's political interests. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \u201cdomestic terror,\u201d and Trump has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \u201cgoing to go through hell.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said she\u2019d opened an investigation \u201cto see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we\u2019re coming after you,\u201d Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network.

      "Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.",
      "\u201cI\u2019s not the type of act that I would prioritize,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cNot right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\u201d",
      "Theresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.",
      "\u201cHate on Elon and Trump all you want \u2014 that\u2019s fine and dandy, it\u2019s your choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify ruining somebody\u2019s property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There\u2019s other ways to get your voice heard that\u2019s more effective.\u201d",

      "\u201cI love my car. It\u2019s the safest car,\u201d Ramsdell said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.\u201d",

      "BREMEN, Maine -- Commercial fishermen and seafood processors and distributors looking to switch to new, lower-carbon emission systems say the federal funding they relied on for this work is either frozen or unavailable due to significant budget cuts promoted by President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "The changes are designed to replace old diesel-burning engines and outdated at-sea cooling systems and are touted by environmentalists as a way to reduce seafood's carbon footprint. Salmon harvesters in Washington state, scallop distributors in Maine and halibut fishermen in Alaska are among those who told The Associated Press their federal commitments for projects like new boat engines and refrigeration systems have been rescinded or are under review.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty. This is not a business-friendly environment,\u201d said Togue Brawn, a Maine seafood distributor who said she is out tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cIf they want to make America great again, then honor your word and tell people what's going on.\"",
      "Decarbonization of the fishing fleet has been a target of environmental activists in recent years. One study published in the  Marine Policy journal states that more than 200 million tons of carbon dioxide were released via fishing in 2016.",
      "That is far less than agriculture, but still a significant piece of the worldwide emissions puzzle. With Earth experiencing worsening storms and its hottest year on record in 2024, reducing the burning of fossil fuels across different industry sectors is critical to fighting climate change, scientists have said.",
      "But climate-friendly projects often cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, leading fishermen to seek U.S. Department of Agriculture or Environmental Protection Agency funds to cover some costs. DOGE, a commission assembled to cut federal spending, has targeted both agencies for cutbacks.",
      "That has left fishermen like Robert Buchmayr of Seattle on the hook for huge bills. Buchmayr said he is nearing completion of a refrigeration project for a salmon boat and was counting on a $45,000 USDA grant to pay for a chunk of it. The agency told him last month the funding is on hold until further notice, he said.",
      "\u201cI'm scrambling, where does the money come from. I was counting on the grant,\u201d Buchmayr said. \u201cI was under the impression that if you got a grant from the United States, it was a commitment. Nothing in the letter was saying, 'Yes, we'll guarantee you the funds depending on who is elected.'\u201d",
      "The full extent of the cuts is unclear, and fishermen affected by them described the situation as chaotic and confusing.",
      "Representatives for the USDA and EPA did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press about the value of the cuts and whether they were permanent. Dan Smith, USDA Rural Development's state energy director for Alaska, said updates about some grants could arrive in April.",
      "Numerous fishermen, commercial fishing groups and advocates for working waterfronts told The Associated Press they learned about the changed status of their grant money in February and March. Some were told the money would not be coming and others were told the funds were frozen while they were subject to a review.",
      "Many prospective grant recipients said they have had difficulty getting updates from the agencies. The lack of certainty has fishermen worried and seeking answers, said Sarah Schumann, a Rhode Island fisherman and director of the Fishery Friendly Climate Action Campaign, a fishermen-led network that works on climate issues.",
      "\u201cThey've started contacting me in the last couple of weeks because they've had the plug pulled on money that was already committed,\u201d Schumann said. \u201cIf they miss a season they could go out of business.\u201d",
      "In Homer, Alaska, Lacey Velsko of Kaia Fisheries was excited for her decarbonization project, which she said hinged on hundreds of thousands of dollars via a USDA grant to improve a refrigeration system on one of her boats. The recently completed project burns less fuel and yields a higher quality project for the company, which fishes for halibut, Pacific cod and other fish, she said.",
      "But, now the company is told the money is unavailable, leaving a huge cost to bear, Velsko said.",
      "\u201cOf course we think it was unfair that we signed a contract and were told we would be funded and now we\u2019re not funded. If six months down the road we\u2019re still not funded I don\u2019t know what avenue to take,\u201d she said.",
      "The funding cuts have also hurt seafood processors and distributors, such as Brawn in Bremen, Maine. Brawn said she received a little more than half of a USDA grant of about $350,000 before learning the rest might not arrive.",
      "Brawn received the grant for Dayboat Blue, a project that uses a membership-based model to get Maine seafood to nationwide customers while reducing the carbon footprint of transportation and packaging.",
      "\u201cThis model can really help fishermen, it can help consumers, it can help communities,\u201d Brawn said. \u201cWhat it's going to do is it's going to stop the program.\u201d",
      "The confusion on the waterfront is another example of the bumpy rollout of government cutbacks under Trump. The Trump administration halted its firings of hundreds of federal employees who worked on nuclear weapons programs last month. It also moved to rehire medical device, food safety and other workers lost to mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration. New tariffs on key trading partners have also been chaotic.",
      "In Bellingham, Washington, EPA funding was paused for five engine replacement projects split between three companies, said Dan Tucker, executive director of the Working Waterfront Coalition of Whatcom County. He said the uncertainty about funding has made it difficult for fishermen to move ahead with projects that will ultimately benefit their businesses and the community at large.",
      "\u201cA lot of the small guys are like, 'Well, I really want to help out with climate change but I can't afford it,'\u201d Tucker said.",

      "A North Dakota jury on Wednesday found Greenpeace must pay hundreds of millions of dollars to a pipeline company in connection with protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline.",
      "The jury found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims and awarded Dallas-based Energy Transfer and subsidiary Dakota Access more than $650 million in damages.",
      "The lawsuit accused Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. of defamation, trespass, nuisance, civil conspiracy and other acts.",
      "Greenpeace said earlier that a large award to the pipeline company would threaten to bankrupt the environmental group. Following the nine-person jury\u2019s verdict, Greenpeace\u2019s senior legal adviser said the organization's work \u201cis never going to stop.\u201d",
      "The independent global campaigning network has been fighting for a wide array of environmental issues for more than half a century and has a long history of contentious legal battles.",
      "Here are some things to know:",
      "Environmental activists founded the group in Vancouver, Canada, in 1971.",
      "The network's first action was to work to stop more nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka Island in the Aleutian island chain in southwest Alaska. They took a ship toward the island to \u201cbear witness,\" which is a Quaker protest tradition, but were intercepted by the U.S. Navy, according to the Greenpeace website.",
      "The U.S. later opted to abandon their nuclear testing grounds on the island, marking Greenpeace's first major victory.",
      "During initial work to stop the nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka, Canadian ecologist Bill Darnell was leaving one of the group's meetings when someone held up two fingers and said \u201cpeace!\u201d according to Greenpeace\u2019s website.",
      "Darnell, who is considered a founding member of Greenpeace, replied: \u201cLet\u2019s make it a Green Peace.\u201d",
      "The name was condensed into one word so it could fit on buttons for the group's first fundraiser.",
      "Greenpeace describes itself as the largest environmental campaigning organization in the world. It is made up of dozens of independent national or regional organizations in more than 55 countries, according to its website.",
      "Its work to preserve and restore valuable ecosystems and push back on fossil fuel corporations is centered on nonviolent action. Its protests have ranged from efforts to stop Shell from drilling for oil in the Alaskan Arctic to demonstrations to put an end to France's atmospheric tests in the South Pacific to campaigns to conserve Canada's coastal rainforest.",
      "Greenpeace and its activists have also been the target of charges and lawsuits, including in 2023 when four activists were arrested for scaling the country estate of former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and draping it in black fabric to protest his plan to expand oil and gas drilling in the North Sea. They were later cleared of criminal charges.",
      "It was also one of the environmental groups that filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Willow oil project in Alaska in recent years.",
      "Greenpeace is an independent network that does not take money from governments, corporations or political parties, according to its website. Its funding comes from individual contributions, along with foundation grants.",
      "In 2023, Greenpeace USA had about $40 million in revenue and support, and about $38 million in expenses, according to its online financial statement.",
      "Its website says it does not consider anyone a permanent friend or enemy.",
      "\u201cIf your government or company is willing to change, we will work with you to achieve your aims,\" its website states. \u201cReverse course, and we will be back.\u201d",

      "Several new bars dedicated to women\u2019s sports have made the mad dash to open in time to capitalize on March Madness, now in full swing",
      "PHOENIX -- When you walk into Title 9 Sports Grill in Phoenix's Melrose District, its mission to be a haven for watching women's sports permeates every nook and cranny. From the over dozen TVs mounted on pink and orange walls to the \u201cPlay Like a Girl!\u201d neon sign against a giant image of retired WNBA star Diana Taurasi.",
      "It's an impressive turnaround for co-owners Audrey Corley and Kat Moore. Just before Christmas, the space was still Moore and her husband Brad's hot dog restaurant. But last summer they sold the business and the new owners didn't want to stay in the property. That's when Corley, who owns a popular lesbian bar on the next block, proposed partnering on the city's first women's sports-centric bar. She had been mulling the idea since reading about the Sports Bra in Portland, Oregon, which opened in 2022, and then seeing a half-dozen similar bars emerge in the last year.",
      "\u201cThen I see, you know, another one popped up here and another one. And then I was like, it\u2019s just time. It has to be,\u201d Corley said before Title 9's grand opening earlier this month.",
      "Several new bars dedicated to women's sports have made the mad dash to open in time to capitalize on March Madness, now in full swing. From San Francisco to Cleveland, there will be more than a dozen across the country before the year is over. The femme-focused bar scene has made huge strides from three years ago when The Sports Bra was the only one. It comes during an exciting first year during which teams in the women's bracket will finally be paid for playing in the NCAA tourney. Many credit stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese for increasing the marketability of female players.",
      "Last season, Reese and Clark's teams never saw a dollar. Now, the women's teams will finally earn individual revenue, known as \u201cunits.\u201d A unit is money paid to conferences when one of its teams appears in the NCAA Tournament. Teams earn another with every game played.",
      "The most seamless part of transforming her old restaurant into Title 9 has been the built-in community anticipation of having a place to view women's sports, Moore said.",
      "\"The only question I\u2019ve gotten from quite a few men, especially when we first started telling people, was, \u2018Are men allowed?\u2019 Yeah!\u201d Moore said, with a chuckle.",
      "Named for the landmark 1972 law that forbids discrimination based on sex in education, including athletics, Title 9 is filled with tributes to female athletes, from framed photos with QR codes to a cocktail roster with drinks such as the Pat Summitt Sour and Taurasi Goat-Tail. However, the owners emphasize a family-friendly atmosphere where young girls can come celebrate after a school game.",
      "\u201cEven some of the little girls, they could come here and dream of being on the TV someday and actually getting paid for it,\u201d Corley said.",
      "Debra Hallum and Marlene du Plessis were also inspired by the Sports Bra. They made their targeted opening in Austin last week of 1972 ATX Women's Sports Pub across from the University of Texas campus. The day included a rainbow ribbon cutting and officials from the Austin LGBT Chamber of Commerce.",
      "While they are in a conservative state, the women have been emphasizing the bar\u2019s LGBTQ-friendliness.",
      "\u201cWe want to be very clear that we will be a very welcoming and inclusive space for all women sports fans,\u201d Hallum said. \u201cWe want to invite everyone to grow the interest and the viewership, because that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to fix that gap for women, including the pay gap.\u201d",
      "Neither woman has hospitality experience. Hallum has a corporate background and du Plessis' is in education. But, they researched running a business like this and hired a talented chef and staff. It's clear both are passionate.",
      "\u201cIt is so hard to find a bar or a pub that will show women\u2019s sports,\u201d du Plessis said. \u201cYou always have to call around, ask around to find where they going to show it. And then most of the time you know they will not have the sound on. And we will.\u201d",
      "They've been touched by the reactions from residents, even parents of boys.",
      "\u201cWe had a mom and dad, two daughters and their son show up and (the mom) was all about, 'This is exactly what we need,\u2019\u201d Hallum said. \u201cWe want our son to be raised knowing that this is just as great and just as wonderful as men\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "In Denver, Annie Weaver and Miranda Spencer met playing on opposing flag football teams. A month later, they began drafting a business plan for a similar concept, also inspired by The Sports Bra. Open since December, the 99ers Sports Bar is now hosting its first March Madness crowds.",
      "They were first mulling a name that would play off of Mia Hamm, the 1990s soccer icon who inspired Weaver\u2019s Halloween costume for years. They settled on a name that honors the 1999 U.S. Women's World Cup soccer team, filled with names and faces that didn't get as much attention as Hamm.",
      "On a recent Sunday, the bar was standing room only as the TVs aired an NWSL game, Unrivaled semifinal games, and the Selection Sunday broadcast announcing the brackets for the NCAA Tournament.",
      "The city doesn\u2019t even have any women\u2019s teams in the major national leagues, but it was recently awarded the 16th NWSL expansion team, to begin play in 2026.",
      "A tri-fold bracket covered one table, and an impromptu friendship bracelet-making station occupied another.",
      "\u201cI wish I would have had this space growing up,\u201d Spencer said.",
      "These new bar operators agree this is not a trend but an indicator of a market that hasn't been served. But hopefully, anyone looking to open a women's sports bar isn't doing it \u201cjust to be trendy,\u201d said Moore, of Title 9.",

      "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Bold decisions to change Major League Baseball\u2019s longstanding rules quickened the pace of games and revived the popularity of stealing bases over the last few years.",
      "A similarly creative move may be needed to help starting pitching regain the relevance it enjoyed as recently as a decade ago.",
      "Only four pitchers (Seattle\u2019s Logan Gilbert, Kansas City\u2019s Seth Lugo, San Francisco\u2019s Logan Webb and Philadelphia\u2019s Zack Wheeler) threw as many as 200 innings last season, down from 34 in 2014.",
      "During that same 2014 season, all 30 major league teams got over 900 innings from their starting pitchers and five had over 1,000. Last year, only four teams had their starters pitch at least 900 innings, led by Seattle with 942 2/3.",
      "While this shift has been years in the making, the numbers themselves provide a cold slap of reality to longtime fans who remember seeing Bob Gibson throw three complete games in the 1967 World Series or Jack Morris pitching 10 shutout innings in Game 7 of the 1991 Fall Classic.",
      "Going back to the days of Cy Young and Walter Johnson, part of the game's beauty was watching a pitcher work his way through a lineup three or four times.",
      "With every team having multiple relievers who can come out of the bullpen and throw in the high 90s, what could prompt teams to let their starters work deeper into games?",
      "Managers and players struggle to come up with a solution.",
      "\u201cOutside of just changing rules to incentivize managers to keep guys in games longer,\u201d Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.",
      "Roberts\u2019 Dodgers exemplified the bullpen emphasis during their run to the 2024 World Series title. Their starting pitchers worked as many as six innings in just two of their 16 postseason games.",
      "Texas\u2019 Nathan Eovaldi went 5-0 with five postseason quality starts (defined as going at least six innings while allowing no more than three earned runs) a year earlier while helping the Rangers win their first World Series championship. Yet even he understands how much things have changed for starting pitchers since he made his big-league debut in 2011.",
      "\u201cBullpens are a lot different now than they were back then,\u201d Eovaldi said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot more guys who aren\u2019t just eight- and ninth-inning guys. They can come in, in the sixth or seventh, go multiple innings. They all have multiple pitches now as well. I think that\u2019s one of the fascinating things about the bullpen. You don\u2019t have guys who are just a two-pitch mix anymore. They\u2019ve got three or four pitches coming out, and two of them are really, really elite.\u201d",
      "And that\u2019s why there seems only one way to get starters working more innings.",
      "\u201cPutting in rules that you have to,\u201d San Francisco Giants manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve created our own monster. It is what it is.\u201d",
      "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred says it\u2019s too early to explore rules changes.",
      "\u201cOur focus right now is training methods, particularly offseason training methods,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be somewhere between education and recommendations. It\u2019s very hard to tell people you can\u2019t do X, Y and Z, right? They\u2019re grown men and there\u2019s no way to monitor it during the offseason.\u201d",
      "One problem is the lack of a clear consensus on what rule changes could work best.",
      "For instance, MLB had the Atlantic League experiment in 2021 and 2023 with a rule change that would force a team to lose its designated hitter if its starting pitcher didn\u2019t finish at least five innings.",
      "Instituting that kind of rule could be a tough sell in the majors, where some of the league\u2019s most bankable stars such as Shohei Ohtani and Bryce Harper have received ample playing time at DH the last few years. Fans paying to see those stars likely wouldn\u2019t be happy to see them get removed as collateral damage from an early pitching change.",
      "MLB hasn\u2019t announced any similar types of rules experimentations in the minors this season.",
      "The maximum number of pitchers allowed on MLB rosters was lowered from 14 to 13 in 2022, though that limit rises to 14 when rosters expand from 26 to 28 on Sept. 1. A more extreme rule change would be to require starters to work at least five or six innings unless they get injured, throw a certain number of pitches or allow a particular number of runs.",
      "Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said he wouldn\u2019t mind seeing the minor leagues try out more rule changes designed at lengthening starting pitchers. He wants those pitching prospects to get accustomed to working deeper into games.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the way it used to be with starters,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cNow I think the mentality can be, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve done my job. I\u2019ve thrown four or five innings.\u2019 \u201c",
      "Giants pitcher Robbie Ray says the history of the game shows that starters can adapt to longer outings.",
      "\u201cI think starting pitchers are capable of doing it,\u201d said Ray, who won the 2021 AL Cy Young Award with Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of kind of training our bodies to do that again because what\u2019s been expected of us has changed over the years.\u201d",
      "A 62-page MLB study released in December showed how the focus on rising velocities and maximum effort on each pitch had resulted in more injuries among pitchers. That study also revealed that starts of five or more innings dropped from 84% to 70% in the majors from 2005-24 and from 68.9% to 36.8% in the minors.",
      "\u201cBecause we\u2019re trying to create this engine and this repetitive thought of just pure stuff each and every pitch, yeah, starters are going to fatigue sooner,\u201d Cleveland Guardians pitching coach Carl Willis said. \u201cAnd at the same time, we\u2019re training them that way. We\u2019re training them to do so.",
      "\u201cEverybody still talks about wanting to go out for the sixth, wanting to go out for the seventh and getting deep into games. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re training them to do that, and I don\u2019t know how we are kind of teaching nowadays can allow that to happen.\u201d",
      "A change in approach could allow those starters to get that endurance. Right now, it\u2019s the older guys who seem more used to that workload.",
      "The MLB leader in quality starts last season was the 34-year-old Wheeler, who had 26. Lugo, 35, had 22 quality starts to tie for second place.",
      "Even so, the 2024 season did offer some encouraging signs for the future of starting pitching.",
      "MLB pitchers threw 5.22 innings per start last season. That represented the most since 2018, though it was still far off the 2014 average of 5.97.",
      "The 2024 season also featured an MLB average of 85.5 pitches per start, the highest since 2019. Starters haven\u2019t thrown as many as 90 pitches per appearance since 2017.",
      "Perhaps it\u2019s inevitable that the pendulum swing at least a little more toward getting starters to work longer. The recent focus on relievers puts more pressure on them, causing bullpens to break down.",
      "There\u2019s one obvious method to change that.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think necessarily the game is going to all of a sudden turn back the other way, but there\u2019s a huge push to understand how you can keep a bullpen healthy,\u201d Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. \u201cAnd one of the biggest ways is those starters getting through that first bulk and getting you into the sixth or seventh.\u201d",
      "Now it\u2019s just a matter of figuring out how those starters can pitch deeper into games more often.",

      "Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy is suing his former girlfriend who accused him of attacking her",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy sued his former girlfriend who accused him of attacking her, alleging the woman assaulted him and stole or destroyed more than $150,000 in cash and property.",
      "Worthy filed the lawsuit Monday against Tia Jones in Williamson County, Texas, where the two lived and where Worthy played college football at the University of Texas.",
      "Worthy was arrested earlier this month after Jones accused him of assaulting her, but the district attorney declined to file charges in that case after speaking to multiple witnesses.",
      "In his lawsuit, Worthy alleges that Jones fabricated the allegations of abuse and that she became enraged after he asked her to move out of the home they were living in. He says in the lawsuit that Jones assaulted him, ripping out his hair, and destroyed his game room.",
      "He also alleges that while he was in jail, Jones stole a handgun, $30,000 in cash, jewelry, a key to his Rolls Royce and other belongings.",
      "An attorney for Jones, Angelica Cogliano, said Monday she had not seen the lawsuit and declined to comment.",
      "Worthy is seeking between $250,000 and $1 million",
      "\u201cPlaintiff not only suffered bodily injuries and property damage as a result of this incident, but his credibility, veracity, and reputation suffered, and this narrative, although false, will always track his career and future in the NFL,\u201d the suit states.",
      "Worthy was chosen by the Chiefs with the 28th overall pick in last year\u2019s draft after setting the record for the fastest 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He got off to a quick start by scoring a pair of touchdowns in his NFL debut, and after a midseason lull, he became the Chiefs\u2019 go-to wide receiver as they chased an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title.",
      "Worthy finished with 59 catches for 638 yards and six TDs while running 20 times for 104 yards and three more scores.",
      "He was one of the few bright spots for the Chiefs in a 40-22 loss to Philadelphia in the Super Bowl, too. Worthy caught all eight of his targets for 157 yards and a pair of touchdowns at the Superdome in New Orleans.",

    "story": [
      "One of the best rivalries in figure skating in recent years has been between Canada and the U.S. in ice dancing",
      "BOSTON -- American ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates always have been treated with such kindness and support from the people in their longtime training base in Montreal that Canada has become a second home for them.",
      "Many of their closest friends are Canadian. They spend as much time there as they do in the United States.",
      "None of that has changed, necessarily, despite the divisive rhetoric from government officials from both countries and tariff wars simmering between the longtime allies. Yet the two figure skaters have started to notice some other differences lately.",
      "\u201cWe were at a cafe last weekend,\u201d Chock said, \u201cand Evan ordered a coffee \u2014 an Americano \u2014 and the barista delivered it and said, \u2018Here\u2019s your Canadien.' And we were like, \u2018Oh. It\u2019s an Americano, and they don't want to call it an Americano, for obvious reasons.'",
      "\u201cThat was our first experience with that being reflected in Canada.\u201d",
      "Now, the reigning world champions are curious what will transpire this week in Boston, where they'll be trying to win their third straight title against a field that includes their dear friends and longtime rivals, Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada.",
      "Will the American fans at TD Bank Garden support everyone universally, as is the custom in figure skating, when competition begins Wednesday? Or will there be more robust cheering than usual for Chock and Bates, and perhaps even some boos for their neighbors from the north, in what should be a preview of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy?",
      "\u201cAmerica has always had a very global reach when it comes to politics and culture,\" Chock said, reflecting on that cafe encounter, \"but we never really saw that truly reflected in her until that moment, when it was like, 'Oh, OK. I understand now.'\u201d",
      "World pairs champions Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps are just as uncertain what kind of reception they will get in Boston. Stellato-Dudek was born in the Chicago suburbs, but about three months ago she passed the exam to become a Canadian citizen, which was required for her to compete for that country at the Winter Olympics.",
      "That plan was set in motion long before Donald Trump returned to the White House, when the notion of Canada becoming a 51st state seemed downright absurd and American liquor was still being stocked on the shelves of Canadian shops.",
      "Stellato-Dudek twice finished third at the U.S. championships with Nathan Bartholomay before splitting in 2019, and that\u2019s when she teamed up with Deschamps, who had separated from his American partner Sydney Kolodziej the previous year.",
      "Stellato-Dudek and Deschamps considered skating for the U.S., but they were concerned he would not be granted American citizenship in time to compete at the Milano-Cortina Games; the Olympic Charter requires athletes to hold the nationality of the country represented by their National Olympic Committee in order to compete at the Summer or Winter Games.",
      "\u201cI did represent America for many years. I'm very proud to represent Canada. I'm now a Canadian citizen, which is the honor of my life,\u201d Stellato-Dudek said. \"And I have family that still lives in America that will be at an American worlds to come watch me. They are there to cheer me on, and I'm excited to skate for them.",
      "\u201cI think sports is one of the few things that bring people together from all different nationalities and all over the world,\u201d Stellato-Dudek added, \u201cand I hope this world championships does this for everybody as well.\u201d",
      "It promises to be an interesting test case given that the U.S. will be hosting \u2014 along with Canada and Mexico \u2014 the World Cup next year, and two years later, Los Angeles will be welcoming the world for the 2028 Summer Olympics.",
      "Even newly elected International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry, a former Zimbabwe swimmer who graduated from Auburn University, alluded to the challenges that could come with dealing with the Trump administration, whether that be due to trade wars, the war in Ukraine, diversity issues or a host of other potentially discordant viewpoints.",
      "\u201cI have been dealing with, let\u2019s say difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old,\" Coventry said after winning the IOC election in Costa Navarino, Greece. \u201cWhat I have learned is that communication will be key.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, figure skaters headed to Boston this week are hoping to communicate that sports can be a unifying force.",
      "\u201cI mean, we've kind of gone about (that) sport isn't political. We've been raised that way,\u201d said Gilles, who was born in Rockford, Illinois, but whose mother and grandmother are Canadian and who became a Canadian citizen herself 12 years ago.",
      "\u201cWe're lucky to be able to skate in Canada and the U.S. and been welcomed on both soils,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're kind of focused on our job, and let sport be sport, and not let it be political. We can't focus on what we can't control. We can control our skating and we can control that we're proud of our country and proud to represent our country in the U.S.\u201d",

      "Ben McCollum, who led Drake\u2019s dominating run through the Missouri Valley Conference and a win in the NCAA Tournament in his only season with the Bulldogs, is the new head coach at Iowa",
      "Ben McCollum, who led Drake's dominating run through the Missouri Valley Conference and a win in the NCAA Tournament in his only season with the Bulldogs, was named head coach at Iowa on Monday.",
      "Iowa spokesman Matt Weitzel confirmed McCollum's hiring 10 days after athletic director Beth Goetz fired Fran McCaffery and two days after McCollum wrapped up a 31-4 season with a loss to Texas Tech in the second round of the West Regional.",
      "McCollum takes over for McCaffery, who was fired after the Hawkeyes went 17-16 and had their lowest Big Ten regular-season finish in seven years. Iowa also has seen a steep decline in attendance the last two years.",
      "The 43-year-old McCollum's ties to the Hawkeye State run deep. He was born in Iowa City, raised in Storm Lake and played junior college basketball in Mason City.",
      "When he left the state, he didn\u2019t go far. He finished his college playing days at Northwest Missouri State and was an assistant at Emporia State in Kansas. He went back to Northwest Missouri in 2008 for his first head coaching job and won four Division II national championships in 15 seasons.",
      "With four Northwest Missouri players heading to Drake with McCollum, the Bulldogs became one of the top stories in college basketball this season. They were dubbed \u201cDivision II Drake\u201d by some, a moniker that only served to motivate the team.",
      "All four of the Northwest Missouri transfers were starters and one of them, Bennett Stirtz, led the Missouri Valley in scoring and was named conference player of the year and most outstanding player of the MVC Tournament.",
      "The Bulldogs were picked fifth in the 12-team Valley and received no first-place votes. They ended up winning the regular-season championship by two games with 17 conference wins, their most ever. Then they won the Valley tournament to run their overall win total to a school-record 30 in 33 games.",
      "Next was a 67-57 win over Missouri in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.",
      "McCollum coaches a grinding style. The Bulldogs\u2019 tempo was slowest in the nation. Offensive rebounding is emphasized. The defense allows 58.4 points per game, fewest in the nation. Just over 1 in 5 opponent possessions ends with a turnover.",
      "\u201cDeath by a thousand paper cuts,\u201d McCollum called his system.",
      "The Bulldogs knocked off Miami, Vanderbilt and Kansas State on their way to a 12-0 start. Drake dropped back-to-back games before reeling off 11 straight MVC wins.",
      "McCaffery was Iowa\u2019s all-time wins leader and, at 15 years, the longest-tenured coach in program history. The Hawkeyes dropped seven of nine games in February and didn't qualify for the Big Ten Tournament until the last day of the regular season.",
      "The program has struggled to attract elite talent because of its shallow pool of funds for name, image and likeness compensation.",
      "Since McCaffery\u2019s firing, seven players have announced they would enter the transfer portal.",
      "Iowa\u2019s men were 10th in the Big Ten in average paid attendance this season, at 9,161 per game, though actual crowds appeared significantly less. That\u2019s an 8% drop from last season and 26% drop from 2022-23.",

      "Viktor Hovland still isn't comfortable with his swing",
      "PALM HARBOR, Fla. -- Viktor Hovland was steady amid a wild Saturday of charges and collapses at the Valspar Championship, leaving him in a three-way tie for the lead at Innisbrook with two dozen players still very much in the mix.",
      "Jacob Bridgeman showed plenty of mettle in his first time as the 36-hole leader, falling four shots behind at the turn and rallying for a 1-under 70 to share the lead with Hovland (69) and Nico Echavarria (66).",
      "They were at 7-under 206 with seemingly everyone on their heels. That includes Justin Thomas, who left on Friday hopeful he would make the cut. He shot 30 on the back nine for a 65, his lowest round ever on the Copperhead course at Innisbrook, to finish two behind.",
      "Jordan Spieth was entertaining as ever, twice making birdie from deep in the woods, and along with missing a pair of short par putts, and having to settle for a 67. He still was only four shots behind going into a Sunday in which 23 players were separated by four shots.",
      "Byeong Hun An was the only player to reach 9 under with a birdie on the 11th hole, only to make five bogeys over the final seven holes for a 72. Even so, he was only three back.",
      "Hovland came into the week in search of his swing, returning to another coach and being willing to take as much time as he needed to figure out where the ball is going. It's working out in his favor so far.",
      "\u201cIt's fun to be in contention, but it is a little bit more stressful when you don't feel super comfortable over the ball,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cBut man, it's fun to see some putts go in and still see the ball end up close to the hole and put some good scores up there.\u201d",
      "Echavarria, who won in Japan last fall for his second PGA Tour title, finished well ahead of the final groups and played bogey-free for his 66, remarkably making birdie on all three of the par 3s on the back nine.",
      "The Colombian didn't expect to have a share of the lead when he finished, though he knew he would at least have a chance.",
      "\u201cThis is a golf course where you don\u2019t have to be one off the lead starting to get the leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen that it\u2019s a hard golf course. You have to drive your ball very well out here. You have to hit the greens. It\u2019s tough around the greens. So we\u2019re going to have a chance tomorrow having a good round.\u201d",
      "Most impressive was Bridgeman, a second-year player who began the third round by missing a 3-foot par putt. He also took two straight bogeys to finish the front nine and was falling behind. But then he hit wedge to 3 feet for birdie on the 10th and worked his way back. At one point, Bridgeman had seven straight holes without a par.",
      "\u201cI was just head down and grind the best I could,\u201d Bridgeman said. \u201cI wasn't hitting it great. I wasn't flustered, I wasn't really freaking out. But I knew if I could get the ball in the fairway I would be fine.\u201d",
      "He said after the birdie on 10 his caddie G.W. Cable slapped him on the behind and told him, \u201cLet's go.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I kept it up,\u201d Bridgeman said.",
      "Thomas and Spieth teed off some five hours before the leaders, longtime friends who took turns posting birdies. Thomas felt frustrated not to make up much ground until he holed an eagle putt from just inside 30 feet on the par-5 11th hole and was on his way. Thomas birdied the next three holes and at one point was one shot behind.",
      "\u201cWe got on a little four-hole run there and that can be the difference of sparking an entire week or not,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo hopefully that\u2019s the one that sparks the week.\u201d",
      "Ricky Castillo had a 68 and was one shot behind. Thomas and Shane Lowry (70) were among five players at 5-under 208, with An and Billy Horschel (69) in the large group another shot behind. Lucas Glover (69) was part of the group with Spieth at four behind.",
      "\u201cThe leaderboard is stacked. There\u2019s probably like 25 guys \u2014 30 guys maybe \u2014 that can still win this golf tournament,\u201d said Jeremy Paul of Germany, who shot 70 and was in the group two shots behind. \u201cTrying to put a good round together and see where it puts me.\u201d",

The scrappy Spartans trailed by just four early in the fourth quarter before a series of outside shots by Te-Biasu and Smikle gave Maryland some breathing room.",
      "\u201cI think one thing we focused on was calming down,\u201d Smikle said. \u201cI think we started the first half, and a lot of our shots were rushed or we weren\u2019t moving. We just weren\u2019t playing our basketball.\u201d",

As fouls piled up on the Spartans \u2014 including a couple on 3-point shooters \u2014 the Terps made all 12 of their free throws that period and took an eight-point advantage into the fourth.",
      "Norfolk State coach Larry Vickers was disappointed in the fouls and said afterward he felt his team deserves more respect, but he said his players did make some mental mistakes.",
      "\u201cEven though we were scoring, we gave up 30 points. That\u2019s not like us,\u201d he said. \"Was the moment too big for us? I don\u2019t believe so, but I do feel like we were a little undisciplined.\u201d",
      "Still, a couple quick Norfolk State baskets forced Maryland coach Brenda Frese to take a timeout with the score 60-56 and 8:36 remaining. Then Te-Biasu made another 3 and Smikle added two more. Yet another 3 by Te-Biasu made it 72-58 and suddenly it was the Spartans calling time.",
      "Norfolk State: This was the highest seed the Spartans have earned in this tournament, and they showed why, setting the tone early for a competitive game and repeatedly fighting back when the Terps tried to pull away. Fouls hurt badly in the second half, however.",
      "Maryland: The Terrapins turned the ball over 12 times in the first half \u2014 exactly what they wanted to avoid against a team with Norfolk State's quickness \u2014 but they took better care of the ball in the final two quarters to avoid an upset.",
      "\u201cTook a little longer than what I anticipated,\u201d Frese said. \u201cIt took a full 20 minutes and the halftime to be able to reset. So I\u2019m hopeful as we move forward we can get back to playing the way we\u2019re used to playing.\u201d",
      "Maryland shot 6 of 9 from 3-point range in the second half. Without that, the Terps would have been vulnerable.",

      "LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Auburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl began his postgame NCAA Tournament news conference on Saturday night by advocating for the release of Edan Alexander, the last living American being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.",
      "Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier who grew up in the United States, is one of 59 hostages still in Gaza, more than half of whom are believed to be dead. Last week, Hamas said it would release Alexander and the bodies of four other hostages held there since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel if Israel recommitted to a stalled ceasefire agreement.",
      "Pearl, who is Jewish, made the plea for Alexander's return after the top-seeded Tigers' 82-70 victory over No. 9 Creighton, saying he sought his players' permission to bring up the subject.",
      "\u201cI get asked a lot how this basketball program has become so competitive over the last eight years,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cBut for me, I believe it was God\u2019s plan to give us this success, success beyond what we deserve. To give us this platform. To give us an opportunity to start this conference briefly and remind the world that Edan Alexander is still held hostage in Gaza right now. An American held hostage and not enough people in this country know his name.\u201d",
      "Alexander\u2019s father, Adi, said on Friday that he was more optimistic about the chances that the U.S. could secure his son's safe return.",
      "Asked later what made him want to talk about the hostage situation and the Israel-Hamas war, Pearl \u2014 an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump \u2014 referenced his faith and family's migration to the U.S.",
      "\u201cOct. 7 was the worst day since the Holocaust for the Jewish people, and they say they want to do it again and again and again. We have American hostages in Gaza right now, and it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cAnd President Trump called it out, and said if they just free the hostages, the killing would stop. Free the hostages, and the killing will stop, and that\u2019s up to Hamas.\u201d",
      "Pearl has repeatedly voiced his support for Israel on social media, and during a radio interview last month with Dan Bongino, a conservative podcaster and Trump loyalist who has been named deputy director of the FBI, he said he supported Trump's proposal to resettle the 2 million Palestinians who live in Gaza.",
      "By discussing the subject during one of the year's most-watched sporting events, Pearl took his views to a broader audience.",
      "\u201cThis Jewish American loves his country more than anything else. At the same time, Israel, that is our ancestral homeland and it\u2019s under attack,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s under siege. All it wants to do is live in peace with its neighbors.\u201d",

      "WICHITA, Kan. -- It has been nearly two months since American Airlines Flight 5342 lifted off from a wintry runway in southeast Kansas, destined for Washington, D.C., with dozens of members of the tight-knit figure skating community aboard it.",
      "They were just kids, accompanied by parents and coaches, who had been attending a development camp that followed the U.S. championships in Wichita. Many had posted on social media what they had learned \u2014 those jumps and spins and techniques that form the foundation of their sport \u2014 and how eager they were to share their newfound knowledge back home.",
      "They never got that chance. On that January night, their regional jet was on approach to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport when it collided with an Army helicopter, killing all 67 people aboard the two aircraft.",
      "\u201cI'll always have them in my head and my heart,\u201d said world champion Ilia Malinin, the 20-year-old American wunderkind, who will be defending his title in Boston this week. Some of his fellow members of the Washington Figure Skating Club were aboard Flight 5342, and many of them had cheered him to victory at the U.S. championships.",
      "\u201cStill some days I have some of those thoughts, kind of thinking about it. It does upset me a little bit that some days I won't see them on the ice, training with me and looking up to me,\u201d Malinin continued. \u201cThis worlds, I really want to dedicate to everyone on that flight, and give my all to the performance, and really make it special for them.\u201d",
      "When the world championships begin Wednesday at TD Bank Garden, home of the Bruins and Celtics, they will be hosted by the renowned Skating Club of Boston, which produced such Olympic icons as Tenley Albright, Dick Button and Nancy Kerrigan.",
      "The club was rocked on Jan. 29 when it learned that three of its own young skaters \u2014 Jinna Han, Spencer Lane and Olivia Ter \u2014 and coaches Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov were killed in the crash. The next morning, flowers accumulated in the club\u2019s lobby in nearby Norwood, and a single white rose was placed on a table for each member who died.",
      "Kerrigan and Albright were among those who showed up at the club so they wouldn\u2019t have to grieve alone.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know everybody to feel that connection,\u201d Kerrigan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through the same thing \u2014 that training, that rigorous schedule of falling over and over and somehow picking yourself up, which is the main lesson learned in skating: You get back up, keep on trying. And even when it\u2019s hard, you get back up.\u201d",
      "Time has begun to heal some of the wounds. Others, no doubt, will never fully recover.",
      "The healing was aided in part by a gala celebration earlier this month in Washington that included performances by Malinin, U.S. champion Amber Glenn, and former Olympic champions such as Scott Hamilton, Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi.",
      "It was broadcast locally and streamed on Peacock, and NBC will be airing an encore performance next Sunday.",
      "During the 2-plus hour event, 13-year-old Isabella Aparicio skated in memory of her brother, Franco, and father, Luciano, who were on the flight. Maxim Naumov, who lost his parents in the crash, performed in their honor. The tears were flowing from the best figure skaters of past and present, and more than $1.2 million was raised for the families of those affected.",
      "Now, the world championships provide another chance for the skating community to heal.",
      "International Skating Union president Jae Youl Kim made a tearful announcement during the European championships in Estonia that those killed in the crash would be honored in Boston. The highlight comes Wednesday, on the opening night of competition, when a tribute and remembrance will take place between the women's and pairs short programs.",
      "\u201cThis is almost part of a process of recovery, of dealing with the grief and supporting the families, and then it's still focusing on competition as a way of dealing with all that,\u201d said Sam Auxier, the interim CEO of U.S. Figure Skating. \u201cBoston will be a bit of a peak of all that energy we're seeing now around this tragedy, and how it could become something very positive.\u201d",
      "In that respect, the skating community is rising en masse for the world championships this week. Malinin called it a coincidence \u2014 \u201can unfortunate coincidence,\u201d he said \u2014 that worlds would be taking place on American soil after the crash.",
      "Unfortunate that the crash occurred. Fortuitous that it can provide another chance to honor and remember.",
      "\u201cBoston is a great host,\u201d said Evan Bates, who along with his American partner and wife, Madison Chock, will be chasing their third consecutive ice dance world title. \"The Skating Club of Boston, it's steeped in history with U.S. Figure Skating. We have so much respect for the community. And we know the community has been through some hard times.",
      "\u201cWe're looking forward to a great event,\u201d Bates said. \u201cI think everybody is looking forward to something to cheer for.\u201d",

      "John Calipari is heading back to the Sweet 16 after sending a second straight Hall of Famer home from the NCAA Tournament\u2019s \u201cRegion of Coaches.\u201d",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- John Calipari is heading back to the Sweet 16 after sending a second straight Hall of Famer home from the NCAA Tournament\u2019s \u201cRegion of Coaches.\u201d",
      "One game after knocking out good friend Bill Self and the Kansas Jayhawks, Calipari's 10th-seeded Arkansas Razorbacks beat longtime nemesis Rick Pitino and St. John's 75-66 on Saturday.",
      "That earned Calipari an especially sweet 16th trip to the Sweet 16, with his fourth school. And, perhaps more deliciously, it ended Pitino's chances of a long March Madness run with his second-seeded Red Storm.",
      "\u201cRick did a great job with his team all year,\u201d Calipari said. \u201cIf they made a few shots, they would probably beat us. We were fortunate to get out.\u201d",
      "Pitino and Calipari have crossed paths for almost 50 years, with a rivalry that peaked when Calipari was at Kentucky, where Pitino had won an NCAA title, and Pitino was down the road in Louisville. Although the two Hall of Famers insist they have no ill will toward one another, they are most definitely not friends.",
      "The coaches shared a polite pregame handshake and met at center court when it was over, with the Arkansas\u2019 fans chants of \u201cWooo pig sooie!\u201d finally heard over the Pitino-loving crowd.",
      "\u201cThey outplayed us. They deserve to move on and we don\u2019t,\u201d Pitino said. \u201cThat\u2019s what March Madness is all about. No matter how good a regular season you have, you play this way, you\u2019re going to get beat.\u201d",
      "The scoreboard: Calipari is 17-13 against Pitino, including the six NBA matchups they split. Cal is now 3-2 against his elder in the NCAA Tournament; in fact, the Arkansas coach entered this year's brackets with 56 March Madness wins, tied for the most among active coaches with Michigan State's Tom Izzo. Both are still in the field.",
      "Calipari has now taken UMass, Memphis, Kentucky and Arkansas to the Sweet 16. Pitino made it with Providence, Kentucky and Louisville, but never got out of the first weekend with Boston University, Iona or \u2014 so far \u2014 St. John's.",
      "But Pitino has two national championships \u2014 with Kentucky and Louisville \u2014 to one for Calipari.",
      "\u201cYou know, he\u2019s on Chapter 2 of his new book and we\u2019re on Chapter 1,\u201d Calipari said this week. \u201cAs a matter of fact, we\u2019re probably on the first few pages of the chapter. It\u2019s both of us writing another story and being able to come back here.\u201d",
      "Calipari led the Wildcats to the 2012 national title \u2014 16 years after Pitino won in Lexington \u2014 but after a five-year span in which the Wildcats won just one March Madness game, he defected to Arkansas to start fresh.",
      "Beset by early injuries, the Razorbacks lost their first five games in an unprecedentedly deep Southeastern Conference before earning their way into the NCAA Tournament after missing just one year.",
      "\u201cWe had a long, up-and-down season,\u201d said Arkansas freshman Billy Richmond III, who scored 16 points on Saturday. \u201cWe all came together, put our egos to the side and became one heartbeat.\u201d",
      "Calipari tried to get in good with the fans in Providence by talking about all the Italian restaurants he\u2019s hit on Federal Hill \u2014 \u201c under the pineapple,\u201d in the local parlance. But that was a losing battle this weekend: Whatever split there might be in Kentucky over their popularity, Providence is all Pitino.",
      "The 72-year-old New Yorker remains beloved in the city where he led the Friars to the 1987 Final Four. He continued to vacation in tony Newport for years, even as he climbed the coaching ladder, slid to the bottom, and started his way back up again.",
      "Although Arkansas led most of the game, the Pitino fans outshouted the Razorback backers, rising to a thunderous cheer when Zuby Ejiofor responded to a flagrant foul with a rim-shaking dunk. Big East Player of the Year RJ Luis Jr. followed with a steal and a dunk of his own to tie it 24-all, and the crowd sent St. John\u2019s into a timeout with a chant of \u201cLet\u2019s go, Johnnies!\u201d",
      "Arkansas led by as many as 13 in the second half and still had an eight-point edge before the Johnnies cut it to 62-60 with 6:11 to play. But Pitino, who has built his career on full-court defense and 3-point shooting, could only summon one of them when he needed it.",
      "St. John\u2019s shot 2 for 22 from 3-point range \u2014 Arkansas was barely better, at 2 for 19 \u2014 and the Red Storm missed six straight from beyond the arc in the final minutes.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were championship-driven in our minds, but I have been disappointed before with this,\" Pitino said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind going out with a loss, I just hate to see us play that way offensively. It\u2019s just a bitter pill to swallow with that type of performance.\u201d",

      "Two years ago, Goldin was a key player on FAU's Final Four team. When Michigan fired coach Juwan Howard and hired Dusty May away from FAU a year ago, the new coach brought his old center with him to Ann Arbor.",

      "Goldin gave Michigan a 35-34 lead when he sank a pair of free throws coming out of a timeout with 2:18 left in the first half, but the Wolverines missed their last seven shots and trailed 39-35 at the break after a putback by Payne and a 3-pointer from C.J. Wilcher. They fell behind 60-50 before their comeback.",

      "BEIJING -- It's highly technical work in what looks more like a lab than a museum: A fragment of a glazed roof tile from Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City is analyzed in a state-of-the-art X-ray diffraction machine that produces images, which are then projected onto computer screens.",
      "The fragment being examined has a dark area on its surface that restorers want to understand. Their objective is to better preserve the artifacts at the sprawling imperial palace, the former home of China\u2019s emperors and its seat of power for hundreds of years.",
      "\u201cWe want to learn what the black material is,\" said Kang Baoqiang, one of the restorers at the complex, today a museum that attracts tourists from all over the world. \u201cWhether it\u2019s atmospheric sediment or the result of substantial change from within.\u201d",
      "About 150 workers on the team fuse scientific analysis and traditional techniques to clean, patch up and otherwise revive the more than 1.8 million relics in the museum's collection.",
      "They include scroll paintings, calligraphy, bronzes, ceramics \u2014 and, somewhat unexpectedly, ornate antique clocks that were gifted to emperors by early European visitors.",

      "In the corners of social media dominated by wellness content, influencers recommend an assortment of treatments and products to support weight loss, fight exhaustion or promote other desired health outcomes.",
      "Some of the endorsed approaches may be helpful. Many play into fads with scant evidence to back up enthusiasts' claims, medical experts say.",
      "Some influencers encourage their followers to avoid specific food items, such as seed oils, while others advocate going all in on certain foods, such as the meat-heavy carnivore diet. There are video pitches for berberine, a chemical compound that\u2019s been touted online as \u201cnature\u2019s Ozempic,\u201d and for non-medical IV vitamin therapy, which businesses popularly known as drip bars market as cures for hangovers or fatigue.",
      "To be sure, alternative health practices and cures that lacked the medical establishment's backing were a part of popular culture long before the internet age. But the plethora of advice shared online has both prompted calls for safeguards and found a measure of mainstream acceptance.",
      "The new U.S. health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had his Instagram account suspended in 2021 for posting misinformation about vaccine safety and COVID-19, but many of the ideas he champions have a widespread following. Critics of Dr. Mehmet Oz accused him of sometimes making misleading assertions on the talk show he used to host; Oz now is President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.",
      "A Netflix series released last month explored the story of Belle Gibson, a popular Australian wellness influencer who amassed a following talking about curing her terminal brain cancer with a healthy lifestyle and alternative medicine. In 2015, Gibson admitted to lying about having a cancer diagnosis. Australia\u2019s federal court later fined her for failing to donate money she said would go to charity through sales of her cookbook and app.",
      "With personal wellness remaining a hot topic, here are some tips health experts have for evaluating the material you see online:",
      "Most influencers have or want business relationships with companies that allow them to earn income by promoting products. The arrangements don't necessarily mean content creators don\u2019t believe in what they\u2019re marketing, but they do have a vested interest in publicizing products that may or may not work.",
      "Creators can get paid for pictures or videos that hype up a product and also earn commissions on sales through features such as affiliate links. Experts note it's therefore better to proceed with caution when someone inspires you to hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, whether it's for natural supplements, teas with purported weight loss benefits or any other wellness products that show up in your social media feed.",
      "Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a sizable amount of Instagram and TikTok posts that discussed five popular medical tests mostly came from account holders with \u201csome form of financial interest\u201d in promoting the screenings.",
      "After analyzing roughly 980 posts on the two platforms, researchers said most of the posts they found were misleading and failed to \u201cmention important harms, including overdiagnosis\u201d resulting from health people having full-body MRIs or tests to detect early signs of cancer, evaluate microorganisms in the gut or measure hormone levels.",
      "Promoting dietary supplements has been a particularly lucrative exercise for many influencers, said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta. He views the supplements industry as \u201cthe backbone\u201d of health misinformation aimed at consumers and designed to fuel billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where if someone is selling a supplement, it\u2019s a red flag,\u201d he said. \"I don\u2019t think it was always like that, but it certainly is now.\u201d",
      "In general, consumers should take all bold claims with a degree of skepticism, said Cedric Bryant, chief executive officer at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise. The goal of creators is to increase engagement with their content, and some influencers may be tempted to make unproven assertions to draw in more viewers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Bryant said.",
      "Some health and wellness influencers have medical training, but many do not. Before taking health tips from someone on social media, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure they have the proper expertise or at least able to share the data that led them to recommend certain products or lifestyle choices.",
      "In the fitness area, Bryant recommends checking to see if a creator holds certification from an accreditation organization and then confirming the information through the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals database.",
      "The American Medical Association and The American Board of Medical Specialties maintain searchable databases for medical doctors, which may help verify the qualifications of creators who share their legal names and general locations. States also operate databases that allow users to check if someone is licensed to practice medicine or has been disciplined for misconduct.",
      "If an influencer holding the appropriate credentials pushes certain products, consumers still may want to consider if a brand partnership or other factors are shaping their recommendations.",
      "Federal Trade Commission guidelines that reflected the agency's interpretation of federal law directed influencers featuring specific products or services to prominently disclose any endorsements. Yet sponsorships and potential conflicts of interest are not always revealed.",
      "In 2023, the year the guidelines were issued, the FTC issued warnings to a dozen online influencers for failing to adequately disclose paid social media posts that promoted \u201csugar-containing products\u201d and aspartame, a sweetener found in diet soda, ice cream and other foods. Some of the influencers were registered dieticians.",
      "If a creator cites studies to support health and diet claims, it\u2019s best to check and see if what they\u2019re saying aligns with the latest evidence-based medical consensus.",
      "\u201cJust because somebody has an \u2018M.D.\u2019 after their name doesn\u2019t make them entirely trustworthy,\u201d said Elias Aboujaoude, a psychiatrist and Stanford University professor who studies the intersection of psychology and technology.",
      "Aboujaoude suggests double-checking health claims with traditionally reputable sources, such as major academic institutions or government health agencies. He also advised looking at studies cited by creators and assessing whether they\u2019ve been published in reputable journals and subjected to peer review.",
      "In some cases, it might be too soon to know if promising results should be trusted or not, said Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian with the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. For example, a study might show the benefits of a specific type of herb. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the findings have been replicated in other research, a requirement for treatment methods to be considered proven effective, she said.",

House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.",
      "An earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.",
      "The result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams \u2014 some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.",
      "But while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party\u2019s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They\u2019re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we\u2019re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we\u2019ve only just begun.\"",
      "Booker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year \u2014 and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a fine line before we\u2019re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,\u201d said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing \u2018get ready with me\u2019 videos. It would look super cringe. But I\u2019m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,\u201d said Jacobs.",
      "Some Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it\u2019s communicated on.",
      "\u201cIf you know how to talk to people, it doesn\u2019t matter what medium is going to exist,\u201d said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. \u201cYou could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don\u2019t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it\u2019s just not going to translate.\u201d",

      "ROME -- Residents of the Tuscany beach enclave of Orbetello are seeking a state of emergency declaration to help combat an invasion of midges that are keeping people indoors and threatening businesses catering to tourists.",
      "Millions of the tiny bugs have invaded Orbetello, a speck of land that juts out into the Orbetello lagoon, a natural reserve off Tuscany's coast between the Tyrrhenian Sea and Monte Argentario.",
      "Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. Similar invasions have occurred in the past, and fishermen say the die-offs are the result of overall oxygen depletion in the lagoon ecosystem.",
      "On Thursday, Orbetello city hall allocated 300,000 euros ($327,000) and promised a series of specific emergency interventions to combat the invasion, following a meeting with key trade associations.",
      "A permanent commission was created and the emergency measures would aim to \u201cprotect citizens and economic activities in the area,\u201d Mayor Andrea Casamenti said in a statement. But no details were immediately released.",
      "Local residents want more, demanding that the Tuscan region declare a state of emergency to free up even further funding. A change.org petition \u201cSave the Orbetello Lagoon\u201d had registered more than 19,000 signatures by late Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe cannot take a walk in the open air. We cannot open the windows. We are segregated in the house\" like during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the petition read. It blamed ineffective management of the lagoon for the calamity.",
      "Pier Luigi Piro, president of the Orbetello fishermen cooperative, said that the lagoon ecosystem needs serious infrastructural investments to clean out canals and favor the exchange of water between the lagoon and the Tyrrhenian. He said that he hoped that the consortium of the mayor's office and trade groups that have come together to deal with the crisis gets to work as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cEverything we're doing, we hope to have a serene tourist season, otherwise beyond the damage a lot of activities will risk closure,\u201d he warned.",

      "An experimental treatment appears to postpone Alzheimer's symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease at a young age",
      "An experimental treatment appears to delay Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease in their 40s or 50s, according to new findings from ongoing research now caught up in Trump administration funding delays.",
      "The early results \u2014 a scientific first \u2014 were published Wednesday even as study participants worried that politics could cut their access to a possible lifeline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a study but it has given me an extension to my life that I never banked on having,\u201d said Jake Heinrichs of New York City.",
      "Now 50, Heinrichs has been treated in that study for more than a decade and remains symptom-free despite inheriting an Alzheimer\u2019s-causing gene that killed his father and brother around the same age.",
      "If blocked funding stops Heinrichs\u2019 doses, \u201chow much time do we have?\u201d asked his wife, Rachel Chavkin. \u201cThis trial is life.\u201d",
      "Two drugs sold in the U.S. can modestly slow worsening of early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s by clearing the brain of one of its hallmarks, a sticky gunk called amyloid. But until now, there haven't been hints that removing amyloid far earlier \u2013 many years before the first symptoms appear \u2013 just might postpone the disease.",
      "The research led by Washington University in St. Louis involves families that pass down rare gene mutations almost guaranteeing they\u2019ll develop symptoms at the same age their affected relatives did \u2013 information that helps scientists tell if treatments are having any effect.",
      "The new findings center on a subset of 22 participants who received amyloid-removing drugs the longest, on average eight years. Long-term amyloid removal cut in half their risk of symptom onset, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Lancet Neurology.",
      "Despite the study\u2019s small size, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d said Northwestern University neuroscientist David Gate, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Now participants have been switched from an earlier experimental drug to Leqembi, an IV treatment approved in the U.S., to try to answer the obvious next question.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to determine over the next five years is how strong is the protection,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Dr. Randall Bateman, who directs the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer\u2019s Network of studies involving families with these rare genes. \u201cWill they ever get the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease if we keep treating them?\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the worry: Bateman raised money to start that confirmatory study while seeking National Institutes of Health funding for the full project but his grant has been delayed as required reviews were canceled. It's one example of how millions of dollars in research have been stalled as NIH grapples with funding restrictions and mass firings.",
      "At the same time researchers wonder if NIH will shift focus away from amyloid research after comments by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, nominated as the agency's new director.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I think that we have not made progress in Alzheimer\u2019s, as much as we ought to have, is because the NIH has not supported a sufficiently wide range of hypotheses,\u201d Bhattacharya told senators, responding to one who brought up an example of earlier science misconduct unrelated to current research.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes Alzheimer\u2019s, a mind-destroying disease that affects nearly 7 million Americans, mostly late in life. What\u2019s clear is that silent changes occur in the brain at least two decades before the first symptoms -- and that sticky amyloid is a major contributor. At some point amyloid buildup appears to trigger a protein named tau to begin killing neurons, which drives cognitive decline.",
      "Tau-fighting drugs now are being tested. Researchers also are studying other factors including inflammation, the brain\u2019s immune cells and certain viruses.",
      "NIH\u2019s focus expanded as researchers found more potential culprits. In 2013, NIH\u2019s National Institute on Aging funded 14 trials of possible Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, over a third targeting amyloid. By last fall, there were 68 drug trials and about 18% targeted amyloid.",
      "Northwestern\u2019s Gate counts himself among scientists who \u201cthink amyloid isn\u2019t everything,\u201d but said nothing has invalidated the amyloid hypothesis. He recently used brain tissue preserved from an old amyloid study to learn how immune cells called microglia can clear those plaques and then switch to helping the brain heal, possible clues for improving today's modest therapies.",
      "For now, amyloid clearly is implicated somehow and families with Alzheimer's-causing genes are helping answer a critical question for anyone at risk: Can blocking amyloid buildup really stave off symptoms? Without NIH funding, Bateman said, that opportunity will be lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d said longtime study participant June Ward, who lives near Asheville, North Carolina, and plans to ask friends to complain to lawmakers.",
      "Ward turns 64 in June and is healthy, two years older than when her mother's symptoms appeared. \u201cIt is exciting to think about the possibility that Alzheimer\u2019s disease might not be what gets me,\u201d she said.",
      "In New York, Heinrichs said he has hope that his 3-year-old son won\u2019t \u201cexperience the stress and sorrow that I lived through as a young man to watch my father fade away.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need the NIH to be not politicized,\u201d added Chavkin, his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s just about keeping people alive or helping them live better. And in this case, it\u2019s helping my husband survive.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon has sued the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission for finding the e-commerce giant legally responsible for the recalls of hundreds of thousands of products sold on its site.",
      "The independent federal agency ordered Amazon in January to take several actions, including notifying customers who bought more than 400,000 items covered by recalls and giving refunds to those who could prove the products were properly disposed of or destroyed.",
      "The order followed the commission's unanimous determination last summer that Amazon was a \u201cdistributor\u201d of faulty items sold on its website by third-party sellers and shipped through the company\u2019s fulfillment service",
      "But Amazon has long disputed it qualifies as a \u201cdistributor\u201d of products offered by other sellers. In its lawsuit filed on March 14, the company maintained it serves as a \u201cthird-party logistics provider\" and therefore should not be held liable for recalls of products that were made, owned and sold by others.",
      "The commission sued Amazon in 2021 for allegedly distributing hazardous items, accusing the company of putting consumer safety at risk by failing to properly notify the public about recalled products that included defective carbon monoxide detectors and flammable children\u2019s pajamas.",
      "Amazon said in its lawsuit that it issued previous recall notices and some refunds shortly after the CPSC raised safety concerns several years ago. The company argues the commission is an \u201cunconstitutionally structured agency\u201d that overstepped its authority with the new directive.",
      "\u201cThe remedies ordered by the CPSC are largely duplicative of the steps we took several years ago to protect customers, which are the same steps we take whenever we learn about unsafe products,\u201d Amazon said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. The Seattle-based company said it could not comment further on its lawsuit filed last week.",
      "Amazon and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX also have active lawsuits challenging the structure of the National Labor Relations Board as unconstitutional. The two companies initiated the cases after the labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes about workers\u2019 rights and union organizing.",
      "The Consumer Product Safety Commission declined to comment Wednesday on Amazon's lawsuit complaint. In a Jan. 17 statement about the hazardous products order, Commissioner Richard L. Trumka Jr. said it was the CPSC's job to \u201chold companies like Amazon accountable\" and \u201cno company is above the law.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "States and cities across the country are grappling with how to stay on the right side of government transparency laws as the use of encrypted messaging apps becomes more widespread",
      "As a devastating wildfire burned through a Maui town, killing more than 100 people, emergency management employees traded dozens of text messages, creating a record that would later help investigators piece together the government's response to the 2023 tragedy.",
      "One text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.",
      "\u201cThat's what Signal was supposed to be for,\u201d then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.",
      "Signal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.",
      "While such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren't returned under public information requests.",
      "An Associated Press review in all 50 states found accounts on encrypted platforms registered to cellphone numbers for over 1,100 government workers and elected officials.",
      "It's unclear if Maui officials actually used the app or simply considered it \u2014 a county spokesperson did not respond to questions \u2014 but the situation highlights a growing challenge: How can government entities use technological advancements for added security while staying on the right side of public information laws?",
      "The AP found accounts for state, local and federal officials in nearly every state, including many legislators and their staff, but also staff for governors, state attorneys general, education departments and school board members.",
      "The AP is not naming the officials because having an account is neither against the rules in most states, nor proof they use the apps for government business. While many of those accounts were registered to government cellphone numbers, some were registered to personal numbers. The AP's list is likely incomplete because users can make accounts unsearchable.",
      "Improper use of the apps has been reported over the past decade in places like Missouri, Oregon, Oklahoma, Maryland and elsewhere, almost always because of leaked messages.",
      "Public officials and private citizens are consistently warned about hacking and data leaks, but technologies designed to increase privacy often decrease government transparency.",
      "Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Confide, Telegram and others use encryption to scramble messages so only the intended end-user can read them, and they typically aren\u2019t stored on government servers. Some automatically delete messages, and some prevent users from screenshotting or sharing messages.",
      "\u201cThe fundamental problem is that people do have a right to use encrypted apps for their personal communications, and have those on their personal devices. That\u2019s not against the law,\u201d said Matt Kelly, editor of Radical Compliance, a newsletter that focuses on corporate compliance and governance issues. \u201cBut how would an organization be able to distinguish how an employee is using it?\u201d",
      "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, has recommended that \u201chighly valued targets\u201d \u2014 senior officials who handle sensitive information \u2014 use encryption apps for confidential communications. Those communications are not typically releasable under public record laws.",
      "CISA leaders also say encrypted communications could be a useful security measure for the public, but did not encourage government officials to use the apps to skirt public information laws.",
      "Journalists, including many at the AP, often use encrypted messages when talking to sources or whistleblowers.",
      "While some cities and states are grappling with how to stay transparent, public record laws aren\u2019t evolving as quickly as technology, said Smarsh general manager Lanika Mamac. The Portland, Oregon-based company helps governments and businesses archive digital communications.",
      "\u201cPeople are worried more about cybersecurity attacks. They\u2019re trying to make sure it\u2019s secure,\u201d Mamac said. \u201cI think that they are really trying to figure out, \u2018How do I balance being secure and giving transparency?\u2019\u201d",
      "Mamac said Smarsh has seen an uptick in inquiries, mostly from local governments. But many others have done little to restrict the apps or clarify rules for their use.",
      "In 2020, the New Mexico Child, Youth and Families Department\u2019s new division director told employees to use the app Signal for internal communications and to delete messages after 24 hours. A 2021 investigation into the possible violation of New Mexico\u2019s document retention rules was followed by a court settlement with two whistleblowers and the division director's departure.",
      "But New Mexico still lacks regulations on using encrypted apps. The AP's review found at least three department or agency directors had Signal accounts as of December 2024.",
      "In Michigan, State Police leaders were found in 2021 to be using Signal on state-issued cellphones. Michigan lawmakers responded by banning the use of encrypted messaging apps on state employees\u2019 work-issued devices if they hinder public record requests.",
      "However, Michigan's law did not include penalties for violations, and monitoring the government-owned devices used by 48,000 executive branch employees is a monumental task.",
      "The best remedy is stronger public record laws, said David Cuillier, director of the Brechner Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. Most state laws already make clear that the content of communication \u2014 not the method \u2014 is what makes something a public record, but many of those laws lack teeth, he said.",
      "\u201cThey should only be using apps if they are able to report the communications and archive them like any other public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Generally, Cuillier said, there\u2019s been a decrease in government transparency over the past few decades. To reverse that, governments could create independent enforcement agencies, add punishments for violations, and create a transparent culture that supports technology, he said.",
      "\u201cWe used to be a beacon of light when it came to transparency. Now, we\u2019re not. We have lost our way,\u201d Cuillier said.",

      "Dozens of companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more",
      "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- From the grounds of a gas-fired power plant on the eastern shores of Canada, a little-known company is pumping a slurry of minerals into the ocean in the name of stopping climate change.",
      "Whether it\u2019s pollution or a silver bullet that will save the planet may depend on whom you ask.",
      "From shore, a pipe releases a mixture of water and magnesium oxide \u2014 a powdery white mineral used in everything from construction to heartburn pills that Planetary Technologies, based in Nova Scotia, is betting will absorb more planet-warming gases into the sea.",
      "\u201cRestore the climate. Heal the ocean,\u201d reads the motto stamped on a shipping container nearby.",
      "Planetary is part of a growing industry racing to engineer a solution to global warming using the absorbent power of the oceans. It is backed by $1 million from Elon Musk\u2019s foundation and competing for a prize of $50 million more.",
      "Dozens of other companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more. Nearly 50 field trials have taken place in the past four years, with startups raising hundreds of millions in early funds.",
      "But the field remains rife with debate over the consequences for the oceans if the strategies are deployed at large scale, and over the exact benefits for the climate. Critics say the efforts are moving too quickly and with too few guardrails.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West. Everybody is on the bandwagon, everybody wants to do something,\u201d said Adina Paytan, who teaches earth and ocean science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.",
      "Planetary, like most of the ocean startups, is financing its work by selling carbon credits \u2014 or tokens representing one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed from the air. Largely unregulated and widely debated, carbon credits have become popular this century as a way for companies to purchase offsets rather than reduce emissions themselves. Most credits are priced at several hundred dollars apiece.",
      "The industry sold more than 340,000 marine carbon credits last year, up from just 2,000 credits four years ago, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi. But that amount of carbon removal is a tiny fraction of what scientists say will be required to keep the planet livable for centuries to come.",
      "Those leading the efforts, including Will Burt, Planetary\u2019s chief ocean scientist, acknowledge they\u2019re entering uncharted territory \u2014 but say the bigger danger for the planet and the oceans is not moving quickly enough.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand if it\u2019s going to work or not. The faster we do, the better.\u201d",
      "Efforts to capture carbon dioxide have exploded in recent years.",
      "Most climate models now show that cutting emissions won\u2019t be enough to curb global warming, according to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The world needs to actively remove heat-trapping gases, as well \u2014 and the ocean could be a logical place to capture them.",
      "Money has already poured into different strategies on land \u2014 among them, pumping carbon dioxide from the air, developing sites to store carbon underground and replanting forests, which naturally store CO2. But many of those projects are limited by space and could impact nearby communities. The ocean already regulates Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing heat and carbon, and by comparison, it seems limitless.",
      "\u201cIs that huge surface area an option to help us deal with and mitigate the worst effects of climate change?\u201d asked Adam Subhas, who is leading a carbon removal project with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, based on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On a Tuesday afternoon along the edge of Halifax Harbour, Burt stashed his bike helmet and donned a hard hat to give two engineering students a tour of Planetary\u2019s site.",
      "A detached truck trailer sat in a clearing, storing massive bags of magnesium oxide mined in Spain and shipped across the Atlantic to Canada.",
      "Most companies looking offshore for climate solutions are trying to reduce or transform the carbon dioxide stored in the ocean. If they can achieve that, Burt said, the oceans will act \u201clike a vacuum\u201d to absorb more gases from the air.",
      "Planetary is using magnesium oxide to create that vacuum. When dissolved into seawater, it transforms carbon dioxide from a gas to stable molecules that won\u2019t interact with the atmosphere for thousands of years. Limestone, olivine and other alkaline rocks have the same effect.",
      "Other companies are focused on growing seaweed and algae to capture the gas. These marine organisms act like plants on land, absorbing carbon dioxide from the ocean just as trees do from the air. The company Gigablue, for instance, has begun pouring nutrients in New Zealand waters to grow tiny organisms known as phytoplankton where they otherwise couldn\u2019t survive.",
      "Still others view the deepest parts of the ocean as a place to store organic material that would emit greenhouse gases if left on land.",
      "Companies have sunk wood chips off the coast of Iceland and are planning to sink Sargassum, a yellowish-brown seaweed, to extreme depths. The startup Carboniferous is preparing a federal permit to place sugarcane pulp at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, also referred to as the Gulf of America as declared by President Donald Trump.",
      "Though Planetary's work can sound like some \u201cscary science experiment,\u201d Burt said, the company\u2019s testing so far suggests that magnesium oxide poses minimal risks to marine ecosystems, plankton or fish. The mineral has long been used at water treatment plants and industrial facilities to de-acidify water.",
      "Halifax Harbour is just one location where Planetary hopes to operate. The company has set up another site at a wastewater treatment plant in coastal Virginia and plans to begin testing in Vancouver later this year.",
      "According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the industry needs to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year by mid-century to meet climate goals set nearly a decade ago during the Paris climate agreement.",
      "\u201cThe whole point here is to mitigate against a rapidly accelerating climate crisis,\u201d Burt said. \u201cWe have to act with safety and integrity, but we also have to act fast.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s broad enthusiasm in the industry, coastal communities aren\u2019t always quick to jump on board.",
      "In North Carolina, a request to dump shiploads of olivine near the beachside town of Duck prompted questions that downsized the project by more than half.",
      "The company Vesta, formed in 2021, promotes the greenish-hued mineral as a tool to draw down carbon into the ocean and create mounds that buffer coastal towns from storm surges and waves.",
      "During the permitting process, officials at the state Wildlife Resources Commission, Division of Marine Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service raised a long list of concerns.",
      "\u201cAs proposed, the project is a short term study with the potential for long term impacts and no remediation plans,\u201d a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote. The agencies said olivine could smother the seafloor ecosystem and threaten a hotspot for sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon.",
      "Vesta CEO Tom Green said the company never expected its original application to be approved as written. \u201cIt\u2019s more the start of a dialogue with regulators and the community,\u201d he said.",
      "The project went forward last summer with a much smaller scope, a restoration plan, and more detailed requirements to monitor deep-water species. Eight thousand metric tons of olivine shipped from Norway are now submerged beneath North Carolina\u2019s waves.",
      "Green said he understands why people are skeptical, and that he tries to remind them Vesta\u2019s goal is to save the environment, not to harm it. It\u2019s the company\u2019s job, he says, \u201cto show up in local communities, physically show up, and listen and share our data and build trust that way.\u201d",
      "Fishing communities have opposed another climate project led by Subhas of the Woods Hole research center that has generated 10 months of conversation and debate.",
      "The project as proposed last spring would have poured 66,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide solution into ocean waters near Cape Cod. Woods Hole later proposed downsizing the project to use less than 17,000 gallons of the chemical, with federal approval still pending.",
      "In two separate reviews, the Environmental Protection Agency said it believes the project\u2019s scientific merit outweighs the environmental risks, and noted it doesn\u2019t foresee \u201cunacceptable impacts\u201d on water quality or fishing.",
      "But fifth-generation fisherman Jerry Leeman III wants to know what will happen to the lobster, pollock and flounder eggs that float in the water column and on the ocean surface if they are suddenly doused with the harsh chemical.",
      "\u201cAre you telling all the fishermen not to fish in this area while you\u2019re doing this project? And who compensates these individuals for displacing everybody?\u201d he said.",
      "Subhas\u2019 team expects the chemical\u2019s most potent concentrations to last for less than two minutes in the ocean before it\u2019s diluted. They\u2019ve also agreed to delay or relocate the project if schools of fish or patches of fish eggs are visible in the surrounding waters.",
      "Sarah Schumann, who fishes commercially for bluefish in Rhode Island and leads a campaign for \u201cfishery friendly\u201d climate action, said after attending four listening sessions she\u2019s still unsure how to balance her support for the research with the apprehension she hears in the fishing community.",
      "\u201cIf I was actually trying to decide where I land on this issue, I\u2019d be twisted in knots,\u201d she said.",
      "And Planetary, which has seen little pushback from locals along Halifax Harbour, faced a series of protests against a climate project it proposed in Cornwall, England.",
      "In April last year, more than a hundred people marched along a beach carrying signs that read \u201cKeep our sea chemical free.\u201d",
      "Sue Sayer, who runs a research group studying seals, said she realized in discussions with Planetary that \u201cthey had no idea about what animals or plants or species live in St. Ives Bay.\u201d The company\u2019s initial release of magnesium hydroxide into the bay, she said, fired up a community that is \u201cmassively, scientifically passionate about the sea.\u201d",
      "David Santillo, a senior scientist with Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, took issue with how Planetary proposed tracking the impact of its work. According to a recorded presentation viewed by AP, the company\u2019s baseline measurements in Cornwall were drawn from just a few days.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a baseline over a number of years and seasons,\u201d Santillo said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know whether you would even be able to detect any of your effects.\u201d",
      "An audit commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s Environment Agency found that Planetary\u2019s experiments posed a \u201cvery low\u201d risk to marine life, and a potential for significant carbon removal.",
      "Still, the company put its proposal to pump another 200 metric tons of minerals on pause. Following a government recommendation, Planetary said it would search for a source of magnesium hydroxide closer to the Cornwall site, rather than shipping it from China. It also assured locals that it wouldn\u2019t sell carbon credits from its past chemical release.",
      "Sara Nawaz, research director at American University\u2019s Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal, said she understood why scientists sometimes struggle to connect with communities and gain their support. Early research shows the public is reluctant to the idea of \u201cengineering\u201d the climate.",
      "Many people have a strong emotional connection to the ocean, she added. There\u2019s a fear that once you put something in the ocean, \u201cyou can\u2019t take it back.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just locals who have questions about whether these technologies will work. Scientists, too, have acknowledged major unknowns. But some of the principles behind the technologies have been studied for decades by now, and the laboratory can only simulate so much.",
      "During a recent EPA listening session about the Woods Hole project, a chorus of oceanographers and industry supporters said it\u2019s time for ocean-scale tests.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to move ahead and conduct this work,\u201d said Ken Buesseler, another Woods Hole scientist who studies the carbon captured by algae.",
      "Even so, the ocean is a dynamic, challenging landscape to work in. Scientists are still uncovering new details about how it absorbs and recycles carbon, and any materials they add to seawater are liable to sink, become diluted or wash away to other locations, challenging efforts to track how the ocean responds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get the ocean to do what you want it to,\u201d said Sarah Cooley, a carbon cycle scientist who has worked for the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy and the federal government.",
      "Katja Fennel, chair of the oceanography department at Dalhousie University, works on modeling how much carbon Planetary has captured in Halifax Harbour\u2014 a number that comes with some uncertainty.",
      "She co-leads a group of academics that monitors the company\u2019s project using water samples, sensors and sediment cores taken from locations around the bay. Some days, her team adds a red dye to the pipes to watch how the minerals dissolve and flow out to sea.",
      "The models are necessary to simulate what would happen if Planetary did nothing, Fennel said. They\u2019re also necessary because the ocean is so large and deep it\u2019s impossible to collect enough data to give a complete picture of it.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t measure everywhere all the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Questions also linger about how long the carbon capture will last.",
      "It\u2019s a point especially important to companies working with algae, wood chips, or other organic materials, because depending on where they decompose, they could release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.",
      "The deeper the plants and algae sink, the longer the carbon stays locked away. But that\u2019s no easy feat to ensure. Running Tide, a now-shuttered company that sank nearly 20,000 metric tons of wood chips in Icelandic waters, said carbon could be sequestered for as long as three millennia or as little as 50 years.",
      "Even if these solutions do work long term, most companies are operating on too small of a scale to influence the climate. Expanding to meet current climate goals will take massive amounts of resources, energy and money.",
      "\u201cThe question is, what happens when you scale it up to billions of tons every year?\u201d said David Ho, co-founder and chief science officer of the nonprofit (C)Worthy, which works on verifying the impact of ocean-based carbon removal. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d",
      "Planetary\u2019s Burt imagines a future in which minerals are pumped out through power plants and water treatment facilities on every major coastline in the world. But that would require a large, steady volume of magnesium oxide or similar minerals, along with the energy to mine and transport them.",
      "Seaweed and algae growth would need to expand exponentially. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has estimated that nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s coastline would need to be encircled by kelp to even begin to make a dent in global warming. The company Seafields, which is running tests in the Caribbean, says it envisions building a Sargassum farm between Brazil and West Africa more than 200 miles wide.",
      "There\u2019s the risk that these expansions exacerbate environmental harm that isn\u2019t detectable in small trials, and because of global water circulation, could be felt around the world.",
      "But the alternative to never trying, Ho said, is unabated climate change.",
      "Late last year, Planetary announced that its Nova Scotia project successfully captured 138 metric tons of carbon \u2013 allowing it to deliver exactly 138 carbon credits to two of the company\u2019s early investors, Shopify and Stripe.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous \u2014 it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful \u2014 it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, which scientists have long thought, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe\u2019s history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\u201cIt's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\u201d said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026. And other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency\u2019s Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.",
      "\u201cWe want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\u201d at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what\u2019s called the Big Crunch. It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\u201cNow, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cWould we consider that a good or bad thing? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "The government has claimed that Palestinian protester Mahmoud Khalil intentionally misrepresented information on his green card application and therefore is inadmissible to the United States.",
      "According to recent court filings, President Donald Trump's administration said Khalil failed to disclose when applying for his green card last year that his employment by the Syria Office at the British Embassy in Beirut went \"beyond 2022\" and that he was a \"political affairs officer\" for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees from June to November 2023.",
      "\"Khalil is now charged as inadmissible at the time of his adjustment of status because he sought to procure an immigration benefit by fraud of willful misrepresentation of a material fact,\" attorneys for the administration said in the filing.",

      "The government arrested Khalil on March 8 after invoking a rarely used provision of immigration law that they said allows the secretary of state to revoke the legal status of people whose presence in the country could have \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" The new accusations seem to represent an attempt to strengthen the administration's justification for detaining Khalil and denying his release.",
      "\"Khalil's First Amendment allegations are a red herring, and there is an independent basis to justify removal sufficient to foreclose Khalil's constitutional claim,\" the filing says.",
      "\"The additional charges the government filed last week are completely meritless,\" Marc Van Der Hout, whose legal firm represents Khalil, told ABC News in response to a request for comment. \"They show that the government has no case whatsoever on this bogus charge that his presence in the U.S. would have adverse foreign policy consequences. This case is purely about First Amendment protected activity and speech, and U.S. citizens and permanent residents alike are free to say what they wish about what is going on in the world.\"",
      "\"Regardless of his allegations concerning political speech, Khalil withheld membership in certain organizations and failed to disclose continuing employment by the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut when he submitted his adjustment of status application. It is black-letter law that misrepresentations in this context are not protected speech,\" the government said in the filing.",

    "summary": "Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's special envoy and lead negotiator tasked with ending the war in Ukraine, sat down for an interview with Tucker Carlson.",
    "story": [
      "\"I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,\" Steve Witkoff told Tucker Carlson.",
      "Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's special envoy and lead negotiator tasked with ending the war in Ukraine, has attracted criticism in Europe and Ukraine after an interview where he appeared to back a number of well-known Kremlin talking points on the conflict.",
      "The comments, in which Witkoff seemed to accept the results of sham referenda Russia has previously held in Ukraine to justify its seizure of land there -- including Crimea, will likely feed fears among European allies that the Trump administration is leaning too far toward the Kremlin's vision.",
      "In the interview for \"The Tucker Carlson Show,\" posted online on Friday, Witkoff talked about his efforts to negotiate with President Vladimir Putin, speaking warmly of the Russian leader. Witkoff said he believed the heart of the conflict was Russia's desire to control four regions of Ukraine it partially occupied and has claimed annexed since 2022: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.",
      "Talking about Putin's claims to the regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, Witkoff suggested Russia had a right to them because they were majority Russian-speaking and repeated a false Kremlin claim that fair referenda there showed residents wanted to be absorbed by Russia.",
      "\"They are Russian-speaking, and there have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule,\"\u00a0Witkoff told Carlson.",
      "However, Witkoff did not acknowledge that the supposed referenda held in those territories -- whether in 2014 in the case of Crimea or 2022 in the other regions -- were widely dismissed by Western powers, human rights organizations and international bodies as fraudulent and illegitimate.",
      "Russia conducted referenda in the areas it occupied in Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in the fall of 2022, several months after seizing them with its full-scale invasion launched in February that year. Putin used the referenda to justify Russia's subsequent annexation of the regions. Russia also held a similar referendum in Crimea in 2014 following its occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula.",
      "The referenda were staged after Russia's invasion had already forced hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to flee, and while Russian security forces were abducting and torturing anyone expressing opposition to its takeover. In some areas, Russian soldiers were filmed accompanying vote collectors as they went from house to house.",
      "No legitimate independent international observers monitored the referenda and they were widely dismissed as shams, including by the United States. The United Nations General Assembly rejected the referenda as illegal and violating the U.N. Charter.",
      "In September 2022, then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. \"does not, and will never, recognize any of the Kremlin's claims to sovereignty over parts of Ukraine that it's seized by force and now purports to incorporate into Russia.\"",
      "Witkoff made the remarks on the Russian referenda a day before a new round of talks between the U.S. and Russia in Saudi Arabia aimed at trying to make progress toward ending the war. His portrayal of the referenda as legitimate triggered some fierce criticism in Europe.",
      "\"Witkoff's repeating of Kremlin lies about 'russian-speakers' [sic] wanting to 'join Russia' is truly chilling,\" Lithuania's former foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, wrote on X. \"Hearing Americans talk like this should be an electric shock for Europe, not a wakeup call.\"",
      "Some Ukrainian members of parliament also condemned Witkoff's comments.",
      "Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the statements were \"shocking.\"",
      "\"I don't understand what this is about -- ignorance, naivety, unprofessionalism?\" said Merezhko, who suggested Witkoff should be removed from his negotiating role. \"Because we are talking about a representative of the president, who should professionally understand this issue and know some basic things. And he doesn't know this. He is relaying Russian propaganda.\"",
      "In the interview with Carlson, Witkoff appeared to struggle to remember the names of the Ukrainian regions. \"Donbas, Crimea. You know the names,\"\u00a0he told the conservative media personality, who prompted him to say \"Lugansk\" -- the Russian transliteration for Luhansk. \"Lugansk, and there's two others,\" Witkoff replied.",
      "Although Putin declared he had annexed the four regions, his troops still do not fully control most of the area. Much of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, including their regional capitals, remain unoccupied.",
      "A wealthy real estate developer, Witkoff has emerged as the lead negotiator for Trump's effort to end the war, twice now traveling to Moscow, where he has said he spent several hours talking with Putin.",
      "In his interview on Carlson, Witkoff was effusive in his praise for Putin, calling him a \"very smart guy\" and noting Putin told him he had prayed for Trump after the assassination attempt against him during last year\u2019s presidential campaign. Witkoff added that Putin had given him a portrait of Trump which he says the Russian leader had commissioned from a famous Russian artist.",
      "\"This is the kind of connection that we've been able to reestablish through a simple word called communication, which many people would say I shouldn't have had because Putin is a bad guy. I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,\" Witkoff said.",
      "Witkoff also told Carlson he believed Russia \"does not need to absorb Ukraine,\" saying, \"They've gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\" He also said he \"100%\" believes Russia does not want to invade Europe, saying he took Putin \"at his word\" on that.",
      "Witkoff also repeated an unsupported claim made by Putin that Russian forces have surrounded a significant number of Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk region. Although Ukraine was forced to retreat from Kursk earlier this month, no evidence has emerged to suggest many Ukrainian soldiers are encircled, and both independent researchers and Ukrainian officials have said it is false.",
      "\"Witkoff uncritically amplified a number of Russian demands, claims and justifications,\" the Washington D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) wrote.",
      "Witkoff's comments could feed deep unease in Europe that the Trump administration, which is moving fast to restore relations with Russia, is more aligned with the Kremlin than NATO allies over the war in Ukraine. European officials and observers have also warned the administration, in its hurry to reach a deal, is vulnerable to manipulation by Putin.",
      "The White House has argued its reengagement with Russia brings peace closer, but critics point out that the Kremlin has, so far, yet to make any significant concessions. Trump has claimed he isn't \"aligned\" with Putin. \"I'm not aligned with Putin. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world,\" Trump said last month.",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Monday defended Witkoff, writing on X he was doing an \"incredible job.\"",

      "Boasberg is at the center of the admin's legal fight over deportation flights.",
      "As President Donald Trump's battle with the judiciary escalates, House Republicans are eyeing ways to rein in judges from blocking parts of his agenda.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan said on Monday his panel will hold hearings next week on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who is at the center of the administration's legal fight over deportation flights and the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Trump accused Boasberg -- an Obama appointee who was first named to a lower Washington, D.C., court by President George W. Bush -- of bias and called for his impeachment after he blocked the administration from using a centuries-old law to deport more than 200 alleged gang members to El Salvador.",
      "Trump and his Republican allies, including Jordan, have also taken issue with the use of injunctions and temporary restraining orders to halt Trump policies nationwide as the courts weigh the merits of each case.",
      "\"It really starts to look like Judge Boasberg is operating purely political against the president, and that's what we want to have hearings on -- this broad issue and some of what Judge Boasberg is doing,\" Jordan said on Fox News.",
      "Jordan said he thought Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, will do the same.",
      "In addition to hearings, Jordan said he expects House Republican leadership to move forward with a bill from California Rep. Darrell Issa aimed at limiting some judges' power to issue nationwide injunctions.",
      "Issa's bill -- entitled the \"No Rogue Rulings Act\" -- would put restrictions on federal judges issuing orders providing injunctive relief that impacts the entire country outside their districts.",
      "Jordan called it a \"good piece of legislation.\" The bill was voted out of the House Judiciary Committee before lawmakers broke for recess earlier this month.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson appears to be warming up to the idea of potentially impeaching judges who rule against Trump, saying \"everything is on the table.\"",
      "\"Impeachment is an extraordinary measure. We're looking at all the alternatives that we have to address this problem. Activist judges are a serious threat to our system,\" Johnson said Monday afternoon.",
      "Johnson confirmed that the GOP-led House will hold hearings to \"highlight the abuses\" of federal judges -- saying lawmakers \"may wind up questioning some of these judges themselves to have them defend their actions.\"",
      "\"We'll see about limiting the scope of federal injunctions,\" he added. \"One judge should not be able to suspend and uphold everything that a president does on their issues. I think the American people agree with that.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Johnson appeared to endorse the measure, writing on X that the House is \"working overtime to limit the abuses of activist federal judges.\"",
      "\"Speaker Johnson's indicated he'd like to get this bill to the floor next week and move it through the process,\" Jordan told Fox News. \"So, we think there's some things we can do legislatively, and then, frankly, there's the broader issue of all these judges' injunctions and then decisions like Judge Boasberg ... what he's trying to do, and how that case is working.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the push from Trump, Elon Musk and several Republican hardliners to impeach Boasberg and other judges faces steeper obstacles.",
      "Johnson has not said where he stands on pursuing impeachment, but given the slim House majority, it would be extremely difficult to get the House Republican conference together to vote to impeach a judge.",
      "If the House were to successfully impeach a judge, the Senate would be compelled to act in some way, but the odds of a Senate conviction are almost zero, as it would require support from at least 14 Democrats.",
      "As the rhetoric ramps up between the Trump administration and the courts, the U.S. Marshals Service is warning federal judges of an increase in threats, ABC News reported. Chief Justice John Roberts last week issued a rare public statement amid Trump's attacks on Boasberg, saying impeachment was not \"an appropriate response\" to legal disagreements and that the correct path forward was the appeals process.",

    "story": [
      "The case could have potential implications for the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday grappled with whether or not to send Louisiana legislators back to the drawing board in a high-stakes dispute over the Voting Rights Act and an election map with two majority-black U.S. congressional districts -- which the state's Republican leaders want to keep.",
      "The state's current map, which was used in the 2024 election, was drawn after two lower courts found an earlier version with only one majority-black district had violated Section 2 of the VRA by disenfranchising minority voters, who make up more than a third of the state's population. The layout of Louisiana's congressional districts could have potential implications for the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\"We'd rather not be back at this podium defending a new map this fall,\" Louisiana Solicitor General Benjamin Aguinaga told the justices on Monday.",
      "Aguinaga said the state was happy with the ultimate layout of six congressional districts -- four of which are held by Republicans, two by Democrats -- because it protected key Republican incumbents, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "\"We're in the business of complying with federal court decisions,\" Aguinaga said. \"When they said 'draw a second majority-black,' that's what we did.\"",
      "A group of non-black voters sued the state, alleging the Louisiana legislator's use of race to draw a second majority-black district -- as ordered by the courts -- violated the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, which ensures that everyone is treated equally under the law. They won a favorable decision from a different district court, which wants the state to start over again.",
      "Much of the oral argument in the case, Louisiana v. Callais, focused on how a state was supposed to comply with competing demands from the law -- balancing respect for the VRA and rights of minority voters with the command from the Constitution that treatment of Americans be race-blind.",
      "The Supreme Court has previously given states significant breathing room to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Its rulings have also said race cannot \"predominate\" as a factor in how election maps are drawn, but that politics is a permissible factor.",
      "Several justices indicated that Louisiana's map should stand precisely because it was following court orders.",
      "\"Having a likely Voting Rights Act violation [as the two lower courts initially found], you don't need to engage in the thought process of what if the court order is wrong,\" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. \"It seems to me Louisiana had to follow it.\"",
      "Justice Samuel Alito suggested the high court should scrutinize the lower court mandates that the state create a second majority-black district in the first place. He voiced skepticism that it was necessary.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, frequently a swing vote in close cases, suggested that he believes the use of race in any map drawing should have an expiration date.",
      "\"In our Equal Protection law, the court has said race-based remedial action must have an end point,\" Kavanaugh said. \"How does that apply to Section 2 [of the Voting Rights Act]?\"",
      "The decision in the case could have consequences for who controls power in Washington.",
      "Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the House, which means every single seat could be key to the balance of power after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "A decision is expected by the end of June.",

      "Tom Homan, President Donald Trump's border czar, vowed Sunday that the Trump administration would not defy court orders stemming from legal challenges over its invocation of the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport undocumented migrants from the United States.",
      "For the past week, a federal judge in Washington, James Boasberg, has tried to determine whether the Trump administration ignored an earlier order to temporarily halt deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act when it flew Venezuelan detainees to El Salvador even after the judge ordered their flights to be turned around.",
      "According to Homan, all of those sent to El Salvador were known gang members, and -- he claimed -- most were members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang that the Trump administration has labeled a terrorist organization.",
      "\"That plane removed 240 terrorists from the United States,\" Homan claimed, speaking exclusively on ABC's \"This Week.\"",
      "But family members of some of those flown to El Salvador insist they had no affiliation with any gang. And on Sunday, Homan refused to provide any specific information supporting the Trump administration's claims.",
      "\"Look that's that will be litigated in the courts with this judge,\" Homan said, referring to Boasberg. \"I'm not going to get into every specific case.\"",

      "Trump has publicly blasted Boasberg as \"crooked\" and called for his impeachment.",
      "Here are additional highlights from Homan's interview:",
      "On following court orders",
      "Karl: \"I want to start with something you -- you said last week that caused a big stir. You said, I quote, 'I don't care what judges think.\" Now, I know you have since said the administration will abide by court orders. We heard Donald Trump say the same thing. So, what -- what do you mean when you say, \"I don't care what judges think?\"",
      "Homan: \"Well, I don't care what that judges think, as far as this case. We're going to continue to arrest public safety threats and national security threats. We're going to continue to deport them from the United States. I understand this case is in litigation through the Alien Enemies Act and we'll abide by the court order as litigated. But my point was, despite what he thinks, we're going to keep targeting the worst of the worst, which we've been doing since day one, and deporting them from the United States through the various laws on the book. We're not making this up. The Alien Enemies Act was actually a federal law, it's a statute, enacted by Congress and signed by a president. Now that's our litigation.\"",
      "On people on deportation flights with no criminal history",
      "Karl: \"So, how do you determine -- or how do your people in the field determine that somebody is a gang member?\"",
      "Homan: \"Look, there are various methods. Now, it's not been -- I've noticed in the media, 'Oh, a lot of them don't have criminal histories.' Well, a lot of gang members don't have criminal histories. Just like a lot of terrorists in this world, they're not in any terrorist database, right? We only know information what's in databases based on -- for instance, most terrorists we arrest that are identified by the U.S. government are later identified through a Title Three investigation or through an undercover operation. They're not in any terror screening database, we know that.\"",
      "On due process",
      "Karl: How do you -- I mean, what we've heard from lawyers representing some of these people is that they deny that they're members of -- of this -- of this gang or either, you know, Tren de Aragua, or MS-13. Do they get a chance to prove that before you take them out of the country and put them into a notorious prison in a country that they're not even from? I mean, do they have any due process at all?",
      "Homan: \"But the bottom line is, that plane was full of -- of people designated as terrorists, number one. Number two, every -- every Venezuelan migrant on that flight was a TDA member based on numerous criminal investigation, on intelligence reports, and a lot of work by ICE officers. Matter of fact, two days after that flight took off, I even had a discussion with the acting director of ICE and we -- he reiterated that every person, every Venezuelan on that plane was a known member of the TDA.\"",
      "On verifying every person on flights to El Salvador was a gang member",
      "Karl noted the case of Jerce Reyes Barrios, whose lawyer alleges that he was deported because of his tattoo of the Real Madrid soccer team's logo. Barrios' lawyer said that he had no prior criminal charges or has ever been involved in a gang. Karl asked if the administration would release information on those deported.",
      "Homan: \"Look, that's going to be -- that -- look that would be litigated in the courts with this with this judge. I'm not going to get into every specific case because, you know, there's 260 cases. We got to count on the men and women who do this every day for a living, who -- who -- who designated these people as a members of TDA, through like, I said, various law enforcement methods. This will be litigated.\"",
      "On securing the border",
      "Karl: \"Alright, let me turn to the situation at the border itself. You have now more than 10,000 U.S. troops deployed to support your mission at the border and two Navy destroyers that have been deployed to patrol the waters around the border as well. How long do you expect you are going to need that level of force, military force, at the border, because, as you just mentioned, the numbers are way down? I mean they are dramatically down.\"",
      "Homan: \"We're going to secure the border and make sure no public safety threats or national security threats cross the border and get away. So, look, you know, like \u2013 like we knew what would happen as we secure the southern border, the land border, some of these groups are going to take to maritime, they're going to take to the water. So, we're -- you know, we've got the Coast Guard, we've got CBP maritime patrol, and we're going to have the Navy out there looking at the maritime.\"",

      "\"Pell Grants, Title 1, funding resources for children with disabilities and special needs will be preserved, fully preserved,\" Trump said Thursday before signing the bill. \"They're going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them.\"",
      "The president did not offer any details about how exactly those portfolios would be transferred to other agencies, saying only that it would happen \"immediately.\"",
      "Student Borrower Protection Center Executive Director Mike Pierce condemned the president's announcement, which education advocates have said has created chaos and confusion across the education landscape.",
      "\"Moving the student loan program to the SBA is illegal, unserious, and a clear attempt to distract the public from the fact that Trump has broken the student loan system and is actively cheating millions of borrowers out of their rights,\" Pierce said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "At least one component of the plan -- moving the student loan system to another department -- is likely to face significant legal pushback.",
      "The central legal issue is likely to focus on the Higher Education Act of 1965, which stipulates that the Federal Student Aid Office should be under the purview of the secretary of education.",
      "\"Congress has charged the secretary of education with administering the federal student aid program by issuing student loans and grants to support students' attainment of higher education,\" said Andrew Crook, press secretary for the American Federation of Teachers. \"The department's office of Federal Student Aid is statutorily mandated to do so and has the unique expertise to manage the complex student aid program.\"",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten was more blunt: \"See you in court,\" she said in a statement after Trump signed the executive order on Thursday.",
      "Even conservative policy experts such as Rick Hess, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he expects to see legal challenges because of the Higher Education Act.",
      "Hess supports dismantling the department and has said the Federal Student Aid Office would be a better fit for a different agency with more of a financial background.",
      "This comes as the Department of Education slashed nearly half its workforce recently, gutting large chunks of the Federal Student Aid Office, which handles the student loan portfolio.",
      "At the same time, Education Secretary Linda McMahon pledged either to dismantle the agency altogether, in coordination with Congress, or reallocate its key functions to other agencies.",
      "James Kvaal, who worked in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, told ABC News that his higher education portfolio under President Barack Obama included moving some loan functions to the Treasury Department.",
      "\"Treasury had its own authority to collect on debts, and they wanted to see if they could do a better job with student loans than the Department of Education was doing,\" Kvaal told ABC News on Friday.",
      "\"And the answer was, no, they ended up having higher costs and collecting fewer dollars for Treasury. So, you know, the pilot was abandoned,\" he added.",
      "Because of this, Kvaal said the current dilemma has a bit of a grey area.",
      "Meanwhile, he stressed rehoming the student loan portfolio again could lead to real-world consequences.",
      "\"We're at a point now where millions of borrowers are late on their student loans,\" he said. \"For the department to be focused on laying off half its staff and going through a fundamental reorganization of how it administers these programs, you know, in really critical weeks for borrowers who are trying to get into repayment plans or get loan forgiveness, I think it's very dangerous and puts a risk millions of borrowers of going into default on their loans.\"",
      "Jessica Thompson, senior vice president of The Institute for College Access and Success, underscored borrowers are already experiencing a \"mountain of problems\" with repaying their debts.",
      "\"This can only result in borrowers facing problematic, inaccurate, and inconsistent servicing of their federal student loans,\" Thompson said in a statement to ABC News. \"Errors will prove costly to borrowers and, ultimately, to taxpayers. All of which is preventable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Judges have blocked his transgender military ban, funding freezes and more.",
      "In President Donald Trump's escalating battle with the judiciary, he and his Republican allies have zeroed in on a similar message.",
      "No single judge, they argue, should be able to use an injunction to block the powers of the country's elected chief executive.",
      "\"That's a presidential job. That's not for a local judge to be making that determination,\" Trump said on Fox News earlier this week as he railed against a judge who issued a limited order to stop deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members to other countries after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, peppered with questions after the administration did not turn the planes around, on Wednesday preemptively offered her own rebuke of judges who've recently ordered injunctions taking effect nationwide.",
      "\"The judges in this country are acting erroneously,\" she said. \"We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slow walk this administration's agenda, and it's unacceptable.\"",
      "The White House argues that's especially the case when it comes to immigration matters, foreign affairs, national security and the president exercising his constitutional powers as commander in chief.",
      "Judges have, so far, temporarily blocked Trump's efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military, freeze federal funding and bring an end to birthright citizenship.",
      "Supporters of nationwide injunctions say they serve as an essential check to potentially unlawful conduct and prevent widespread harm. Critics say they give too much authority to individual judges and incentivize plaintiffs to try to evade random assignment and file in jurisdictions with judges who may be sympathetic to their point of view.",
      "In general, legal experts told ABC News an injunction is meant to preserve the status quo while judges consider the merits of the case. (Judges also issue temporary restraining orders -- with similar impact -- as short-term emergency measures to prevent irreparable harm until a hearing can be held.)",
      "\"Often the nationwide injunction, or universal injunction, is put in place right at the start of a litigation,\" said Amanda Frost, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.",
      "\"All of these can be appealed, and they are,\" Frost said. \"It's appealed to a three-judge court and then the Supreme Court after that. So, when people say one district court is controlling the law for the nation, well maybe for a few weeks. The system allows for appeals, and the Trump administration has appealed.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts said the same in a rare statement after Trump attacked the federal judge in the deportation flight case as a \"Radical Left Lunatic\" and called for him to be impeached.",
      "In fact, Trump was handed a win when an appeals court last week lifted an injunction on his executive orders seeking to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the federal government.",
      "Nationwide injunctions are also not new, though scholars agree they've been used far more in recent decades.",
      "\"We saw them with Obama, we saw them with the first Trump administration, and saw them with Biden,\" Frost said. \"And now we're seeing them even more with President Trump but they go in lockstep with the sweeping executive orders that seek to change and upend vast swaths of our legal structure.\"",
      "According to a study by the Harvard Law Review, President Barack Obama faced 12 injunctions, the Trump administration faced 64 and President Joe Biden 14 injunctions.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have either urged the judiciary to rein in injunctions or celebrated their outcomes, depending on whether they align with their political goals.",
      "In 2023, when a federal judge in Missouri issued an injunction limiting contact between the Biden administration and social media sites, then-candidate Trump called it a \"historic ruling\" and the judge \"brilliant.\" The U.S. Supreme Court eventually sided with the Biden administration on the issue.",
      "Now, the Trump administration is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to curb injunctions after three different federal judges temporarily blocked the president's birthright citizenship order, saying it likely violated the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"At a minimum, the Court should stay the injunctions to the extent they prohibit agencies from developing and issuing public guidance regarding the implementation of the Order. Only this Court's intervention can prevent universal injunctions from becoming universally acceptable,\" Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in an application to the high court last week.",
      "Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said he understands the \"frustration\" that can stem from nationwide injunctions but ultimately \"judges are there to make sure that the government doesn't violate the Constitution.\"",
      "\"Trump is really taking a sledgehammer to everything government related,\" he said. \"These norms have been around for decades, so you have to allow some time for the courts, particularly the Supreme Court, to weigh in and say whether this is appropriate or not.\"",
      "The White House has said Trump will comply with the courts, but his intensifying rebukes of judges and rulings have raised the question: What happens if he doesn't?",
      "\"That would completely undermine the integrity of our system,\" Rahmani said.",

But some time between the publication of The New York Times story on Thursday and Musk's visit to the Pentagon Friday morning, the visit turned into just a meeting with Hegseth.",

But I certainly wouldn't want -- you know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible perhaps to that. But it was such a fake story,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday.",

      "\"There was no war plans. There was no Chinese war plans. There was no secret plans. That's not what we were doing at the Pentagon,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Musk arrived at the Pentagon just before 9 a.m. and remained in Hegseth's office for the duration of his visit.",
      "The meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did take place as scheduled, but Paparo did not join the meeting as previously scheduled. One of the officials said the meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the in the conference room known as \"The Tank\" went on for about two hours.",
      "Musk left the Pentagon at 10:21 a.m. -- about 20 minutes after it appeared that the meeting in The Tank actually got underway.",
      "As Musk departed Hegseth's office on Friday, he was asked by reporters how the meeting went and responded that \"it's always a great meeting.\"",
      "\"I've been here before, you know,\" Musk added as both he and Hegseth walked together. Musk did visit the Pentagon in 2016 to meet with then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter.",
      "When they were outside the Pentagon, Hegseth and Musk shook hands and Musk was overhead to say, \"If there's anything I can do to be helpful, I'd like to see you.\"",
      "Neither responded to questions at that time about whether they had discussed China or if was a classified briefing.",
      "Hegseth previously posted on X that the meeting was not about \"China war plans,\" but rather described it as an \"informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production.\"",

Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office, there have been other high-profile incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions\u201d they endured.",
      "\u201cThe only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios said.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren't simply denied entry.",
      "The incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries. Noting the \u201cevolving\u201d federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of non-essential travel for spring break, warning \u201cre-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.\u201d",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Br\u00f6sche, who was held for 45 days, \u201cwere deemed inadmissible\u201d by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but \u201cif statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\" The agencies did not comment on the other cases.",

Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization.",
      "But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, they can still be barred from entering the country.",
      "Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler's dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.",

      "\u201cEnglish is not Lucas' first language and so he said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Las Vegas,' and the agent says, \u2019Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can't do that,'\" Tyler said, recounting what happened.",
      "Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.",
      "After four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts.",
      "During questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.",

      "He was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5.",
      "\u201cWhat happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol\u2019s power,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Br\u00f6sche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11.",

      "The detentions come amid legal fights over the Trump administration's arrests and deportations of other foreigners with valid visas and green card holders, including a Palestinian activist who helped organize campus protests of the war in Gaza.",

It will serve as a crucial barometer of enthusiasm in both parties heading into next year's midterm elections and is happening in a critical battleground state that Trump won by less than a percentage point.",

The Tesla CEO's nascent political operation, which spent more than $200 million to help Trump win in November, is canvassing and advertising in Wisconsin on behalf of the conservative candidate.

      "\u201cIt might not seem important, but it\u2019s actually really important. And it could determine the fate of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis election is going to affect everyone in the United States.\u201d",
      "April 1\u2019s election will determine majority control of a court facing critical issues: abortion rights, collective bargaining and voter access. They include decisions that could have major implications for the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election, particularly if they end up hearing challenges to the state\u2019s congressional maps, which could theoretically swing the balance of power in Washington if they are considerably redrawn.",
      "In 2020, the court rejected Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his election loss in the battleground state in a 4-3 ruling. Trump had sought to have 221,000 ballots disqualified in the state\u2019s two most Democratic counties.",
      "The Supreme Court race is officially nonpartisan, but the campaign has been anything but. Brad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate, has openly courted Trump's endorsement, which he received on Friday night, as he campaigns against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, the Democrat-backed candidate.",
      "The Waukesha County judge and former Republican attorney general attended the president\u2019s inauguration in January, has said that he would be part of a \u201csupport system\u201d for Trump. Earlier this month, he attended a \u201cMega MAGA rally\u201d where he posed for a picture in front of a giant inflatable version of the president, which had a \u201cVote Brad Schimel Supreme Court\u201d poster plastered on its chest.",
      "He spoke on Musk's get-out-the-vote call on Saturday. And he joined the president\u2019s eldest son on stage at a get-out-the-vote rally, where Donald Trump Jr. said a Schimel win would protect his father\u2019s agenda and keep up GOP momentum.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just show up when Trump\u2019s on the ticket,\u201d he said at a brewery in the Milwaukee suburbs. \u201cYou have to engage because it\u2019s not just about now, it\u2019s about that future. This presidency could be put to a halt with this vote.\u201d",
      "Schimel has also resurfaced long-debunked conspiracies about voter fraud that Trump has embraced, urging his supporters to vote early to \u201cmake this too big to rig so we don\u2019t have to worry that at 11:30 in Milwaukee, they\u2019re going to find bags of ballots that they forgot to put into the machines.\u201d",
      "Still, he pledged to judge any case that comes before him on its merits \u2014 including potential cases involving Trump and Musk.",
      "Republicans have cast the race as a chance for Trump\u2019s loyal supporters to rally around their leader and push back against liberal judges they accuse of working to stymie his agenda.",
      "Mailers from Musk\u2019s America PAC feature photographs of the president. \u201cPresident Donald Trump needs your vote,\u201d they read. Others warn that \u201cLiberal Susan Crawford will stop President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "America PAC is also offering Wisconsin voters $100 to sign a petition in opposition to \u201cactivist judges\u201d \u2014 and another $100 for each signer they refer.",
      "Republicans have argued that if even 60% of the voters who cast ballots for Trump in November turn out, Schimel can win, helping to drive momentum for the party heading into next year's midterms.",
      "\u201cIn theory, the opposition party should be energized, but we\u2019re feeling very good about the energy on our side of the aisle,\u201d said Andrew Iverson, Wisconsin GOP executive director.",
      "Andrew Romeo, senior adviser to the Musk-backed group Building America\u2019s Future, which has spent millions on the race, issued a recent memo advising Schimel\u2019s campaign to remind voters that he is \u201ca strong conservative and Trump ally.\u201d",
      "Two groups funded by Musk have so far spent more than $14 million on the race, according to a tally by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice \u2014 with plans to spend around $20 million total.",
      "Musk donated another $2 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party on Thursday, the same day the party gave $1.2 million to Schimel\u2019s campaign.",
      "Under Wisconsin law, contributions to candidates are capped, but candidates can accept unlimited cash from state parties, which in turn can accept unlimited cash from donors.",
      "His spending has helped make the race the most expensive judicial election in the nation\u2019s history, with more than $73 million spent so far, according to the Brennan Center, breaking the record set by another Wisconsin Supreme Court race two years ago.",
      "Crawford has also received her own support from billionaires, including philanthropist George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "Democrats are hoping to channel their voters\u2019 outrage at the Trump administration by casting the race as an opportunity to stand up to Musk. After nearly a decade of running against the president, they see Musk as a potentially more divisive figure who can motivate their base voters to turn out.",
      "\u201cThis race is the first real test point in the country on Elon Musk and his influence on our politics, and voters want an opportunity to push back on that and the influence he is trying to make on Wisconsin and the rest of country,\u201d said Crawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman.",
      "State Democrats have hosted a series of anti-Musk town halls, including one featuring former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, and featured Musk heavily in ads.",
      "Crawford has also seized on Musk, going as far as to refer to her opponent as \u201cElon Schimel\u201d during a recent debate.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let Elon buy the Supreme Court,\u201d read billboards paid for the state Democratic party that depict Musk as Schimel\u2019s puppeteer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many people who are desperate for a way to fight back against what Trump and Musk are doing nationally,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic Party chair, and see the race as an \u201copportunity to punch back.\u201d",
      "Wikler said the party had seen an \u201cexplosive surge\u201d in grassroots and small-donor fundraising from across the country tied to Musk\u2019s involvement. Both in Wisconsin and nationally, Democrats are packing town halls and angrily protesting the Trump administration\u2019s firings of thousands of workers and shutdown of agencies. They have also show disillusionment with their party\u2019s own leaders.",
      "\u201cMost voters still don't know who Crawford and and Schimel are, but they have extremely strong feelings about Musk and Trump,\" he said.",
      "Musk said Saturday that he became involved in the race because it \u201cwill decide how the Congressional districts are drawn in Wisconsin,\u201d echoing Schimel\u2019s claims that Crawford would push through new congressional maps that could favor Democrats.",
      "Schimel\u2019s campaign has relentlessly attacked Crawford for participating in a call with Democratic donors that was advertised in an email as a \u201cchance to put two more House seats in play for 2026,\u201d a reference to the state's redistricting fights that have played out for years.",
      "Crawford has said that she didn\u2019t know that that was how the call had been billed when she joined and that nothing of that nature had been discussed while she was on the line.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, that\u2019s the most important thing, which is a big deal given that the Congressional majority is so razor-thin,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt could cause the House to switch to Democrat if that redrawing takes place, and then we wouldn\u2019t be able to get through the changes that the American people want.\u201d",
      "Musk has also been giving money to Republican members of Congress who have echoed his calls to impeach federal judges whose decisions he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "He has other interests at play.",
      "Democrats and Crawford have noted that, just days before Musk\u2019s groups started spending on the race, Musk\u2019s electric car company Tesla sued Wisconsin over a rule banning car manufacturers from operating dealerships \u2014 forcing buyers to purchase Teslas out of state.",
      "The case could ultimately go before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",

    "story": [
      "Prosecutors in New Mexico's busiest judicial district have been pleading with state lawmakers to amend the children's code to address what they call an unbelievable spike in juvenile crime in Albuquerque",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Behind the wheel of the stolen car was a 12-year-old boy. In the front passenger seat was a boy who just days earlier had marked his 11th birthday. He was waving a handgun as a 15-year-old boy in the backseat recorded video of what police described as a deliberate hit-and-run.",
      "A voice believed to be the 15-year-old\u2019s says, \u201cJust bump him, brah.\u201d The driver asks, \u201cLike bump him?\u201d The rear passenger responds, \u201cYeah, just bump him. Go like \u2026 15 \u2026 20.\u201d",
      "The car smashed into a bicyclist on his way to work. The windshield shattered and the car sped away in the predawn hours that May morning.",
      "Months passed with no arrests. Then in February a video of the deadly crash surfaced on social media. Remarkably it led police back to an 11-year-old who last June was arrested and placed in custody for a series of break-ins and burglaries in northeast Albuquerque. Police also accused the boy of shooting and wounding another teen, which prompted an investigation that turned up firearms and a bullet-proof vest that had been stolen from a police vehicle.",
      "But the allegations of running down and killing a person were on another level, one seldom dealt with in New Mexico's juvenile justice system.",
      "The 11-year-old and the other boys in the car, now ages 13 and 16, were arrested last week in connection with the death of Scott Dwight Habermehl, a father of two and a successful engineer.",
      "Prosecutors said Friday that all three boys will face the same charges: counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, leaving the scene of an accident involving great bodily harm or death and unlawful possession of a handgun by a person under 19. Prosecutors are seeking to have the oldest boy charged as an adult.",
      "The spike in juvenile violence \u2014 particularly this latest case \u2014 has shaken the community, further frustrated law enforcement and added to the pressure on policymakers to reconsider the limitations of a juvenile justice system that wasn't designed to deal with children as young as 11.",
      "Authorities say there's a perception among juveniles that they won't face consequences for violent crimes.",
      "Albuquerque police have arrested numerous teens, most being 15 or older, in homicide cases over the last year. Legal experts and authorities can't recall a case in which someone as young as 11 has faced a murder charge.",
      "Under state law, the 11-year-old cannot be held in a juvenile detention center but will remain in the custody of the state child welfare agency. The other two boys were ordered to remain in a juvenile detention center as their cases proceed, with children's court judges finding they were a danger to themselves and the community.",
      "Santa Fe-based attorney John Day said New Mexico\u2019s juvenile justice system was meant to intervene and get help for children so they wouldn't commit crimes as adults. It was designed with the assumption that kids this young weren't competent to engage in this kind of violent behavior, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously when you have 11-year-olds who are being accused of participating in running over bicyclists and brandishing guns, that\u2019s something that when they were drafting these laws was really not taken into consideration because it was a different time,\u201d Day said.",
      "There is a minimum age for prosecuting juveniles in 26 states, with statutes spelling out various exceptions, according to the National Juvenile Justice Network. But New Mexico is among the many states without a minimum age and state law allows for teenagers as young as 14 in some instances to be tried in adult court only for first-degree murder.",
      "Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman says the streets have changed dramatically since 1993, the last time New Mexico's children's code was meaningfully updated, but the Democratic-controlled Legislature has failed to consider changes that include expanding the types of violent crimes juveniles could be charged in as adults.",
      "Without modernizing the system and pairing meaningful consequences with behavioral health support, Bregman said things will only get worse. He pointed to a proliferation of guns and social media, saying it's out of control.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how they all communicate. This is how they settle grudges. It\u2019s not taking a fistfight behind the high school anymore. They\u2019re pulling out a gun and shooting at an unsanctioned car show,\" he said, referring to a deadly shooting at a park in Las Cruces on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWe need to have our laws catch up with the times,\u201d Bregman said.",
      "Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Saturday reiterated her disappointment that lawmakers failed to pass legislation to address juvenile justice and what she described as a crime crisis. She said lawmakers should expect to be called back for a special session.",
      "Before the creation of juvenile courts more than a century ago, children who were older than 7 were processed and incarcerated under common law just as adults would be. Younger children were considered incapable of possessing criminal intent.",
      "Along with that history, the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention notes on its website that the juvenile court system also was established to provide positive social development for children who lack support at home.",
      "Juvenile justice advocates say cases in which young children are accused of murder are rare but not unheard of. In 2008, Arizona prosecutors handled the case of an 8-year-old boy who shot and killed his father and his father's friend. He pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the death of the friend. Prosecutors dropped the charge for killing his father, saying it was best for the boy not to have to acknowledge killing his father.",
      "Some advocates have pushed for setting the minimum age for prosecution at least 14, citing research suggesting children who enter the juvenile justice system earlier in their lives have more adverse outcomes than older teens.",
      "Before knowing the hit-and-run in New Mexico was deliberate, authorities had warned in a criminal complaint naming the 11-year-old in other crimes that the pattern of misconduct was escalating in violence. The document went on to suggest the boy was a danger to himself and the public.",
      "Cases like this beg questions about how children end up in situations like this and what systems failed them along the way, said Amy Borror, a senior youth policy strategist with The Gault Center, a Washington, D.C.-based youth rights advocacy group.",
      "Another consideration, she said, is that adolescents' brains are wired differently. Borror pointed specifically to the part of the brain that controls reasoning, rational thought and the ability to comprehend the effects of actions.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why kids and teenagers act exactly like kids and teenagers act,\u201d she said, referring to risk-seeking behavior that intensifies while in groups.",
      "The difficulty comes with figuring out how to hold someone accountable when they don't have the same level of rational decision making that adults do, said Joshua Kastenberg, a former lawyer and judge in the U.S. Air Force who now teaches at the University of New Mexico Law School.",
      "\u201cKids in the criminal justice system are one of the more difficult questions in the law,\u201d Kastenberg said. \u201cUnlike adults, where you can simply say, \u2018Well, this person intentionally ran down a cyclist in their car, they\u2019re a danger to society.\u2019 Whether they have anger management problems or they hate cyclists or whatever, they completely disregarded the right of another human being to simply live. ... But when you\u2019re talking about kids, none of that sinks in.\u201d",

      "Troopers said a group of snowmachiners were riding Saturday on the backside of Seattle Ridge in Turnagain Pass, a popular winter recreation area about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southeast of Anchorage.",
      "\u201cWitnesses stated that a juvenile male triggered an avalanche and died after being buried,\u201d troopers said in a statement.",
      "Challan was buried about 10-feet (3-meter) deep in the slide that measured about 500 feet (152 meters) wide, said Wendy Wagner, director of the Chugach National Forest Avalanche Center.",
      "Conditions are worrisome because a weak layer is located about 3 feet (0.91 meters) beneath the snow surface, with newer snow falling on top of the weak layer.",
      "Challan rode over a weak layer of snow that was buried under newer snow, about mid-slope, Wagner said.",
      "When the slide happened, the center's staff was conducting an avalanche awareness day in a parking lot on the other side of Seattle Ridge, she said.",
      "\u201cThese types of avalanches, they can be triggered when you\u2019re on this slope. They can be triggered when you\u2019re on the bottom of the slope and even the side or the top of a slope, because all you have to do is break that weak layer, and then that weak layer shoots out like dominoes and breaks into the slopes,\" she said.",
      "The weak layer can be broken on a flat track, but that wouldn't cause an avalanche because there is no slope for the snow to come down.",
      "\u201cWhen we have avalanche conditions like this, as avalanche professionals, we recommend people just stay on slopes that aren\u2019t steep enough to slide, and then they don\u2019t have to worry about triggering an avalanche, and sadly, this person was not in that scenario,\" Wagner said. \u201cThey were on the edge of the slope and ended up being caught.\u201d",
      "The avalanche center has been warning people of this weak layer for weeks, and there were similar conditions on March 4, when three heli-skiers were killed. That accident happened when they were caught in an avalanche near Girdwood, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Anchorage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still unsafe,\u201d Wagner said Monday. \"We are still recommending that people stick to the lower angle slopes because this is not something we want to mess with.\u201d",

      "The top U.N. official in South Sudan is warning that the country is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- South Sudan is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war, the top U.N. official in the world\u2019s youngest nation warned on Monday, lamenting the government\u2019s sudden postponement of the latest peace effort.",
      "Calling the situation unfolding in the country \u201cdire,\u201d Nicolas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if President Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage \u201cand put the interests of their people ahead of their own.\u201d",
      "There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict. But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer.",
      "More than 40,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a government of national unity. Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 \u2014 and again until 2026.",
      "The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country\u2019s north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, which is widely believed to be allied with Machar.",
      "Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire. Days earlier on March 4, the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir and government troops responded by surrounding Machar\u2019s home in the capital, Juba, and arresting several of his key allies.",
      "Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating \u201cparticularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players.\u201d",
      "He said Kiir and Machar don\u2019t trust each other enough to display the leadership needed to implement the 2018 peace deal and move to a future that would see a stable and democratic South Sudan.",
      "\u201cRampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,\u201d Haysom said.",
      "\u201cGiven this grim situation,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war.\u201d",
      "Haysom, who heads the nearly 18,000-member U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, warned that a relapse into open war would lead to the same horrors that ravaged the country, especially in 2013 and 2016.",
      "He said the U.N. takes the threat of the \u201cethnic transformation\u201d of the conflict very seriously.",
      "To try to prevent a new civil war, the U.N. special envoy said the peacekeeping mission is engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy with international and regional partners, including the African Union.",
      "Haysom said the collective message of the regional and international community is for Kiir and Machar to meet to resolve their differences, return to the 2018 peace deal, adhere to the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve tensions \u201cthrough dialogue rather than military confrontation.\u201d",

      "Federal prosecutors are trying to block the release of a former Minnesota state senator who resigned after he was charged with soliciting a minor for prostitution",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Federal prosecutors are trying to block the release of a former Minnesota state senator who resigned after he was charged with soliciting a minor for prostitution, leveling fresh allegations that he tried to obstruct the FBI's investigation from jail and lied to court personnel when he said he didn't have a gun at his apartment.",
      "Prosecutors asked the court in a filing Sunday for a quick ruling that Justin Eichorn be kept in jail instead of released to a halfway house as scheduled on Tuesday.",
      "Eichorn's new attorneys, whose hiring was first noted in a court filing Sunday, did not immediately reply to voicemails and emails from The Associated Press seeking comment on Monday. The 40-year-old former Republican lawmaker from Grand Rapids has not publicly commented since his arrest during a sting operation in Bloomington last Monday. He was charged in federal court last Wednesday with attempted coercion and enticement of a minor to engage in prostitution, a felony that carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.",
      "In their motion to reopen a detention hearing that was held Thursday, prosecutors said they learned afterward that he had several phone calls in jail with a Grand Rapids woman \u2014 identified only as Individual A but described as a close associate \u2014 and arranged with her to retrieve a computer and other items from the St. Paul apartment where he lived alone during legislative sessions. They said both had been warned that the call was not private and would be recorded.",
      "According to Eichorn\u2019s profile, which was removed from the Senate website last week, he is married with four children.",
      "\u201cEichorn\u2019s conduct evidences a willingness to conceal material facts from the Court and to do so at the expense of public safety,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cEven more concerning, given his and Individual A\u2019s prompt attempt to clear out the St. Paul apartment, is the possibility that Eichorn lied because he thought his associate could clear out the apartment before pretrial services or law enforcement could get there.\u201d",
      "By the time the woman got to his apartment around 9:50 a.m. Friday, the motion said, FBI agents had already secured the unit in preparation for a search. She asked them whether she could go in to retrieve a computer that she said was used for her business. The agents declined and she left. An agent called her a few minutes later and asked her to return for an interview. She declined.",
      "The search warrant, according to the filing, authorized the FBI to look for evidence related to the enticement of a minor charge, as well as evidence of actual or attempted production, receipt, distribution or possession of child sexual abuse images.",
      "During the search, agents found a red computer-type bag on the counter that contained $1,000 in cash, a handgun and ammunition, a laptop computer, an SD memory card, an iPhone and several of Eichorn's Senate business cards, prosecutors said.",
      "They added that the iPhone appeared to have been reset to its factory settings, which can erase all content on the device. While an initial forensic analysis suggested that the phone may have been reset before Eichorn's arrest, they said, the analysis isn't complete and the timing of the reset hasn't been confirmed.",
      "One of the conditions for Eichorn's release to a halfway house was that he not possess firearms. But prosecutors allege he deliberately lied when he told a pretrial services officer after his first court appearance last Thursday that he had no firearm in his apartment.",
      "Prosecutors also argued that Eichorn should remain jailed because the text messages that he exchanged leading up to his arrest with an undercover officer who purported to be a 17-year-old girl demonstrated his \u201cclear familiarity with soliciting commercial sex from minors,\u201d saying they \u201cdepict someone who knows the lingo of the trade.\" When officers arrested him, they seized two cellphones found in his truck, an unopened condom and $129 in cash.",
      "\u201cEichorn\u2019s messages and conduct reveal an experienced operator,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHis pretrial release brings with it a real risk that he would attempt to victimize other minors in the community.\u201d",
      "Eichorn listed his profession as entrepreneur on his former profile and was first elected in 2016. He got some national attention earlier this month as one sponsor of a not-very-serious bill that would have designated \u201cTrump derangement syndrome\u201d as a mental illness.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a petition filed by young climate activists who argued that the federal government's role in climate change violated their constitutional rights, ending a decadelong legal battle that saw many of the plaintiffs grow from children and teenagers into adults.",
      "The landmark case was filed in 2015 by 21 plaintiffs, the youngest 8 years old. They claimed the U.S. government's actions encouraging a fossil fuel economy violated their right to a life-sustaining climate.",
      "The case \u2014 called Juliana v. United States after one of the activists, Kelsey Juliana \u2014 was challenged repeatedly by the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations, whose lawyers argued it sought to direct federal environmental and energy policies through the courts instead of the political process.",
      "Julia Olson, chief legal counsel for Our Children's Trust, the nonprofit law firm that represented the plaintiffs, said the impact of the lawsuit \u201ccannot be measured by the finality of this case alone.\u201d",
      "\u201cJuliana sparked a global youth-led movement for climate rights that continues to grow,\" Olson said in a statement Monday. \u201cIt has empowered young people to demand their constitutional right to a safe climate and future. We\u2019ve already secured important victories, and we will continue pushing forward.\u201d",
      "The plaintiffs wanted the court to hold a trial on whether the U.S. government was violating their fundamental rights to life and liberty by operating a fossil-fuel based energy system.",
      "The case wound its way through the legal system for years. At one point in 2018, a trial was halted by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts just days before it was to begin.",
      "In 2020, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the case dismissed, saying the job of determining the nation\u2019s climate policies should fall to politicians, not judges. But U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken in Eugene, Oregon, instead allowed the activists to amend their lawsuit and ruled the case could go to trial.",
      "Last year, acting on a request from the Biden administration, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel issued an order requiring Aiken to dismiss the case, and she did. The plaintiffs then sought, unsuccessfully, to revive the lawsuit through their petition to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Our Children's Trust, responding to new developments at the federal level, is now preparing a new federal action that is \u201crooted in the same constitutional principles that guided the Juliana case,\" Olson said.",
      "The plaintiffs now range from 17 to 29 years old and have continued their climate advocacy to various degrees, Olson said, adding that some are still in university. About half are from hometowns in Oregon, according to Our Children's Trust's website.",
      "\u201cThey all have incredible stories,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThey're all doing incredible work.\u201d",
      "Juliana, who is now 29, became a primary school teacher in Oregon, said Helen Britto, associate communications director for Our Children's Trust. Other plaintiffs include Alex Loznak, who became a lawyer focused on environmental and immigration work, and Nathan Baring, who now serves as the program director of a reindeer herding association in Alaska.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re part of a wave, so this is not the end of the road by any means,\u201d Baring said of the high court's move.",
      "Miko Vergun, who was born in the Marshall Islands and grew up in Beaverton, Oregon, is fighting for a future where the Pacific island nation can stay above sea level, according to Our Children's Trust's website. She recently graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in cultural anthropology, Britto said.",
      "In Monday's statement, Vergun said the U.S. Supreme Court decision wasn\u2019t what the plaintiffs had hoped for, but there had been \u201cmany wins along the way.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor almost ten years, we\u2019ve stood up for the rights of present and future generations, demanding a world where we cannot only survive, but thrive,\" she said. \"All great movements have faced obstacles, but what sets them apart is the perseverance of the people behind them. We\u2019ve shown the world that young people will not be ignored, and I\u2019m incredibly proud of the impact Juliana v. United States has made.\u201d",
      "Our Children's Trust has filed climate legal actions on behalf of young people in all 50 states, including active cases in Florida, Utah and Alaska.",
      "In a Montana case, the state Supreme Court in December upheld a landmark climate ruling that said the state was violating residents\u2019 constitutional right to a clean environment by permitting oil, gas and coal projects without regard for global warming, and that regulators must consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions when issuing permits for fossil fuel development.",
      "The case, brought by 16 youth plaintiffs, had gone to trial in state district court in 2023. The Montana Constitution requires agencies to \u201cmaintain and improve\u201d a clean environment.",
      "The Montana Department of Environmental Quality, which issues permits for fossil fuel projects, has to abide by the state Supreme Court decision, Olson said, adding that Our Children's Trust will seek to enforce the ruling in the event it is violated.",
      "In a Hawaii case brought by 13 youth over the threat of climate change, both sides reached a settlement last year that requires the state government to achieve zero emissions in its transportation system by 2045. The settlement agreement applies to ground transportation, as well as sea and air transportation between islands. The court will supervise the implementation of the agreement for the next 20 years.",
      "Internationally, the Oregon case has inspired over 60 youth-led climate lawsuits across the world, according to Our Children's Trust.",

      "A Cornell University student involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests has been asked to surrender to immigration authorities",
      "NEW YORK -- An international student at Cornell University involved in pro-Palestinian protests has been asked to surrender to immigration authorities as he seeks to block deportation actions by the Trump administration.",
      "The government action against Momodou Taal comes as President Donald Trump ratchets up efforts to arrest and deport noncitizens who participate in such protests or who demonstrate against Israel's military actions in Gaza. In one of the most high-profile cases, the Justice Department recently lodged new accusations against a Columbia University graduate student who has been detained and targeted for deportation because of his participation in protests.",
      "Taal, a Ph.D. student in Africana studies at Cornell, filed a federal lawsuit March 15 seeking to block enforcement of executive orders by Trump that he feared could lead to his deportation. Taal is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia.",
      "On Friday, just six days later, the 31-year-old international student was asked to surrender to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to his attorneys.",
      "In its court filing, the DOJ said Taal's student visa was revoked before he filed his lawsuit but ICE agents had trouble locating him. The revocation is based on Taal's alleged involvement in \u201cdisruptive protests,\u201d disregarding university policies and creating a hostile environment for Jewish students, the government said.",
      "An attorney for Taal, Eric Lee, said Monday that his client is not being required to surrender before Tuesday's scheduled hearing on the lawsuit in Syracuse.",
      "Taal was temporarily suspended from Cornell for a second time last fall after a group of pro-Palestinian activists disrupted a campus career fair. He has limited access to the upstate New York campus as he continues his studies remotely.",
      "In his lawsuit, Taal and his co-plaintiffs argue that Trump's executive orders violate the free speech rights of international students and scholars. Taal claims he was at the career fair protest for five minutes and had faced no criminal charges.",
      "\u201cIf the First Amendment does not protect the right to attend a demonstration, what\u2019s left?\u201d Lee said. \u201cNot much.\u201d",
      "In the case involving Columbia University, federal prosecutors on Thursday lodged new allegations against graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, saying he had not disclosed his work with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees and his continued employment with the British embassy for Syria, based in Beirut. Prosecutors also said he did not disclose his involvement with Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a coalition group of anti-Israel student organizations.",
      "Ramzi Kassem, an attorney for Khalil, called the allegations \u201cplainly thin,\u201d noting the government would have to prove any omission was both willful and materially important.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very obviously a rearguard action to shore up their immigration case,\u201d he said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is still a case about Mr. Khalil\u2019s pro-Palestinian speech and the fact that the government doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration had previously also argued that Khalil's prominent role in the Columbia University protests amounted to antisemitic support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. Khalil, who received his master\u2019s degree from Columbia\u2019s school of international affairs last semester, served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring.",
      "The administration's argument rests on a seldom-invoked legal statute that authorizes the secretary of state to revoke the visa of any noncitizen whose presence in the United States could be considered a threat to the country\u2019s foreign-policy interests.",

      "\u201cHelene just dropped tons of fuel on the ground,\u201d Scheller said. \u201cThen these flash droughts allow that fuel to dry out very fast.\u201d",

      "Three fires burned at least 7.5 square miles (19.5 square kilometers) in the county and the two larger blazes were completely uncontained, Cannon said in a social media update Monday morning. The Black Cove Fire, one of the larger ones, was moving toward neighboring Henderson County, Cannon said.",

      "A downed power line sparked the Black Cove Fire, but the causes of the other two fires in Polk County were under investigation, according to North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Jeremy Waldrop.",
      "A number of other wildfires burning across the state including one that damaged 500 vehicles at a salvage yard in Burke County, officials said.",
      "Two fires in the South Carolina mountains have led Gov. Henry McMaster to declare a state of emergency.",
      "One fire was in Table Rock State Park in Pickens County and the other was on Persimmon Ridge in Greenville County. Winds and difficult mountainous terrain allowed blazes to grow, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said.",
      "The Table Rock Fire expanded to more than 2 square miles (5.3 square kilometers), including several hundred acres that firefighters intentionally burned to try to contain the flames, officials said.",
      "The Persimmon Ridge Fire, which started Saturday, spread to more than 1.25 square miles (3.2 square kilometers) despite many dozens of water drops, the commission said.",
      "Human activity ignited both the Table Rock and Persimmon Ridge fires. No injuries had been reported, and while no structures were imminently threatened, voluntary evacuations of about 100 homes remained in place.",
      "Scheller, the North Carolina State University professor, predicted this busy fire season if the region saw dry weather following Helene.",
      "Scientists saw something similar in 2022 when a fire burned more than 51 square miles (133 square kilometers) of timberland in the Florida Panhandle. The Bertha Swamp Road Fire almost directly followed the eye pattern from 2018's Hurricane Michael and the fallen pine trees left behind.",
      "Pines and their waxy needles dry out and become very flammable, Scheller said. The fallen trunks can also block roads and paths used to fight fires, experts said.",
      "The last ingredient to fuel wildfires is dry weather. Despite recent rain, the Carolinas are undergoing an extreme drought, according to federal monitors.",
      "The common denominator for many fires on the East Coast is human activity, whether people burn debris, light a campfire that isn\u2019t well watched or toss out cigarette, Scheller said.",
      "And more people living next to areas that can burn make fires a bigger threat, he said.",
      "A forest fire burning in New Jersey\u2019s million-acre Pinelands region was 100% contained on Monday morning, the New Jersey Forest Fire Services said in a post on X. The fire was first spotted Saturday and burned through about 3.5 square miles (5.8 kilometers).",
      "That blaze led authorities to evacuate two campgrounds in Wharton State Forest, officials said. The cause was under investigation.",
      "A front moving off the East Coast brought rain and more humidity to the area, helping firefighters Monday.",

      "Although Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson advised his members to skip the town halls and claimed that they were being filled with paid protesters, some Republicans were still holding them and trying to respond to the criticism.",
      "\u201cIt looks radical, but it\u2019s not. I call it stewardship, in my opinion,\u201d Republican Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida said on a tele-town hall. \u201cI think they\u2019re doing right by the American taxpayer. And I support that principle of DOGE.\"",
      "Still, some Republicans have expressed unease with the seemingly indiscriminate firings of veterans, especially when they have not been looped in on the administration's plans. At a town hall on Friday, Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw told the audience, \u201cWe\u2019re learning about this stuff at the speed of light, the way you are. I think there\u2019s been some babies thrown out with the bath water here, but we\u2019re still gathering information on it.\u201d",
      "Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, added, \u201cIf you\u2019re doing a job that we need you to do, you\u2019re doing it well, yeah, we\u2019ve got to fight for you.\u201d",
      "The Republican chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Rep. Mike Bost, assured listeners on a tele-town hall last week that he and Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins are talking regularly. As the VA implements plans to cut roughly 80,000 jobs, Bost has said he is watching the process closely, but he has expressed support and echoed Collins' assurances that veterans' health care and benefits won't be slashed.",
      "\u201cThey've cut a lot, but understand this: Essential jobs are not being cut,\u201d Bost said, but then added that his office was helping alert the VA when people with essential jobs had in fact been terminated.",
      "Two federal judges this month ordered the Trump administration to rehire the probationary employees who were let go in the mass firings. At the VA, some of those employees have now been put on administrative leave, but a sense of dread and confusion is still hanging over much of the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all kind of wondering what\u2019s next,\u201d said Dan Foster, a Washington state Army veteran who lost his job when the VA canceled a contract supporting a program that educates service members on how to access their benefits and VA programs.",
      "Others are angry they have been portrayed as deadweight and cut from jobs they felt played a direct role in helping veterans get health care.",
      "\u201cFor somebody to go on the news and say we are incompetent or lazy \u2014 that is just false,\u201d said Future Zhou, an Army veteran who had a job managing medical supply inventories for operating rooms at the VA facility in Puget Sound, Washington, before she was fired in February.",
      "As Democrats search for their political footing and a rallying point to unify them, they have zeroed in on the cause of protecting veterans. In both the House and the Senate, Democrats have introduced legislation that would shield veterans from the mass layoffs. And when Trump spoke to Congress this month, many lawmakers invited veterans as their guests.",
      "\u201cThey are outraged,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who is an Iraq War veteran and former assistant secretary at the VA. \u201cThey said Donald Trump promised to watch out for them. And the first thing he does is fire them.\"",
      "Democrats are already pressing their Republican colleagues to show their support for veterans. In negotiations to allow passage of a Republican-backed government funding bill this month, Democrats secured a vote to amend the package to include language that would protect veterans from the federal layoffs. But it failed on party lines in part because the last-minute change would have ensured that Congress missed the deadline to avert a shutdown.",
      "With an eye on the midterm elections, VoteVets, a left-leaning veterans' advocacy group, is already launching video ads that feature veterans sharing their stories of being fired and accusing congressional members of doing \u201cabsolutely nothing.\u201d The ads are directed to five potential swing districts held by Republicans who are veterans themselves.",
      "Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who is also a veteran, said he was unsure whether veterans would shift their political allegiance.",
      "But he said it is at least clear veterans are \u201cpissed.\u201d",
      "Gallego said there's an opportunity for Democrats to hammer home the message that \u201cElon Musk and his buddies would rather just deal with the bottom line and try to save billions of dollars so they can have more tax cuts at the expense of veterans.\u201d",

      "AURORA, Colo. -- With members of a trailblazing Black Air Force unit passing away at advanced ages, efforts to remain true to their memory carry on despite sometimes confusing orders from President Donald Trump as he purges federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "Col. James H. Harvey III, 101, is among the last few airmen and support crew who proved that a Black unit \u2014 the 332nd Fighter Group of the Tuskegee Airmen \u2014 could fight as well as any other in World War II and the years after.",
      "He went on to become the first Black jet fighter pilot in Korean airspace during the Korean War, and a decorated one after 126 missions. He was one of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the first U.S. Air Force Gunnery Meet in 1949, a forerunner of today\u2019s U.S. Navy \u201cTop Gun\u201d school.",
      "\u201cThey said we didn\u2019t have any ability to operate aircraft or operate heavy machinery. We were inferior to the white man. We were nothing,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cSo we showed them.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Trump's January inauguration, the Air Force removed new recruit training courses that included videos of the Tuskegee Airmen.",
      "The removal drew bipartisan outrage and the White House\u2019s ire over what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described as \u201cmalicious implementation\u201d of Trump's executive order.",
      "The Air Force quickly reversed course.",
      "Announcing the reversal, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin said in a statement that the initial removal was because the service, like other agencies, had to move swiftly to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order with \u201cno equivocation, no slow-rolling, no foot-dragging.\u201d",
      "The videos were shown to troops as part of DEI courses taken during basic military training. Some photos of Tuskegee Airmen were also among tens of thousands of images in a Pentagon database flagged for removal.",
      "\u201cI thought there was progress in that area, but evidently there isn't,\" said Harvey, who blamed Trump for contributing to what he sees as worsening prejudice in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll tell him to his face. No problem,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him, \u2018You\u2019re a racist,\u2019 and see what he has to say about that. What can they do to me? Just kill me, that\u2019s all.\u201d",
      "The Tuskegee Airmen unit was established in 1941 as the 99th Pursuit Squadron based at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. The 99th became the 332nd Fighter Group, which by war's end destroyed or damaged more than 400 enemy aircraft in North Africa and Europe during the war and sank a German destroyer in action.",
      "Of the 992 Tuskegee Airmen trained as pilots starting in 1942, 335 were deployed, 66 were killed in action and 32 who were shot down became war prisoners.",
      "In 1949, two months after the airmen's gunnery meet victory in the propeller-driven class, the U.S. Air Force integrated Black and white troops and the Tuskegee Airmen were absorbed into other units.",
      "It took the Air Force almost half a century to recognize 332nd's last achievement: Its success in aerial bombing and shooting proficiency in the gunnery meet at what is now Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.",
      "For decades, the winners were listed as \u201cunknown\u201d and their trophy was missing.",
      "\u201cWe won them all,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t supposed to win anything because of the color of our skin.\u201d",
      "Harvey trained during World War II but was not deployed to combat before the war ended. In Korea, he flew the F-80 Shooting Star jet fighter and earned medals including the Distinguished Flying Cross.",
      "He retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1965 and received an honorary promotion to colonel in 2023.",
      "Trump in 2020 promoted another of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, Charles McGee, to brigadier general. McGee died in 2022 at age 102.",
      "Harvey still regards the Air Force Gunnery Meet as his biggest accomplishment, one the Air Force finally recognized in 1993.",
      "Their missing trophy was found in a museum storeroom not long after.",
      "\u201cWe were good, and they couldn\u2019t take it away from us,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cWe were good. And I\u2019ll repeat it until I die.\u201d",

      "Second lady Usha Vance is set to travel to Greenland this week as President Donald Trump continues to suggest the U.S. could take control of the mineral-rich Artic island",
      "WASHINGTON -- Second lady Usha Vance plans a trip to Greenland, at a time when President Donald Trump has suggested the United States should take control over the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of American ally Denmark.",
      "Vance will leave on Thursday and return Saturday, according to her office. Vance and one of her three children will be part of a U.S. delegation that will \u201cvisit historic sites\u201d and \u201clearn about Greenlandic heritage.\u201d",
      "Media outlets in Greenland and Denmark reported that Vance would be accompanied by Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz. The White House and the National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump had mused during his first term about buying the world\u2019s largest island, even as Denmark, a NATO ally, insisted it wasn\u2019t for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump's plans.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that Trump \u201cdoesn't care\u201d what the Europeans think.",
      "He said Denmark is \u201cnot doing its job\u201d with Greenland and \u201cnot being a good ally,\u201d and \u201cif that means that we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland that is what President Trump is going to do,\u201d Vance said on Fox News' \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d",
      "\"Because he doesn\u2019t care about what the Europeans scream at us, he cares about putting the interests of American citizens first,\" Vance said.",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. will come to control Greenland while insisting he supports the idea for strategic national security reasons \u2014 not with an eye toward American expansionism.",
      "\u201cI think we will have it,\u201d Trump said of Greenland shortly after beginning his second term on Jan. 20. The U.S. already has a military base on Greenland and the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., visited it in January.",
      "On her visit, Usha Vance will attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland\u2019s national dogsled race, featuring about 37 mushers and 444 dogs. The statement said Vance and the U.S. delegation \u201care excited to witness this monumental race and celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity.\u201d",
      "During a recent Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said \u201cDenmark\u2019s very far away\u201d from Greenland, and questioned whether that country still had a right to claim the world\u2019s largest island as part of its kingdom.",
      "\u201cA boat landed there 200 years ago or something. And they say they have rights to it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think it is, actually.\u201d",
      "All five parties in Greenland\u2019s parliament issued a joint statement last week rejecting Trump's remarks. Denmark has recognized Greenland\u2019s right to independence at a time of its choosing.",
      "Beyond his focus on Greenland, Trump has refused to rule out military intervention in Panama to retake that country's canal, said that Canada should be America's 51st state and suggested that U.S. interests could assume control of the war-torn Gaza Strip from Israel and redevelop it as a \u201cRiviera\u201d-like seaside resort.",

      "WELCH, W.Va. -- Veronica Taylor doesn't know how to turn on a computer, let alone use the internet.",
      "The 73-year-old can't drive and is mostly housebound in her mountainous and remote West Virginia community, where a simple trip to the grocery store can take an hour by car.",
      "A new rule that Social Security recipients access key benefits online or in person at a field office, rather than on the phone, would be nearly impossible without help.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s the only way I had to do it, how would I do it?\u201d Taylor said, talking about the changes while eating a plate of green beans, mac and cheese and fried fish with a group of retirees at the McDowell County Senior Center. \u201cI would never get nothing done.\u201d",
      "The requirements, set to go into effect March 31, are intended to streamline processes and combat widespread fraud within the system, according to President Donald Trump and officials in his administration.",
      "They say that's why it's vital for people to verify their identity online or in person when signing up for benefits, or making a change like where the money is deposited.",
      "But advocates say the changes will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable Americans. It will be harder to visit field offices in rural areas with high poverty rates. Often these are the same areas that lack widespread internet service.",
      "Many Social Security field offices are also being shut down, part of the federal government's cost-cutting efforts. That could mean seniors have to travel even farther to visit, including in parts of rural West Virginia.",
      "Donald Reed, who runs a local nonprofit that operates two senior centers, said he has serious concerns about the policy change, and how it\u2019ll affect the people his group serves.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not anti-Trump \u2014 let me say that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the general public greatly supports looking for waste in government. I do not think the general public understands the consequences of the current actions of the government.\u201d",
      "One in three people live in poverty in McDowell County, once one of the nation\u2019s largest coal producers. Around 30% of the population receives Social Security benefits and 20% lack broadband access. People already face huge challenges in accessing basic needs like food and clothing.",
      "Non-profit groups like The Commission on Aging receive money from the federal government to provide rides to the grocery store, medical appointments and free lunch at the county senior center, and could in theory add a stop to the local Social Security office said Reed, who is the group\u2019s director.",
      "But the transportation grant money is already not enough to meet the need. Last year, Reed ran out of money during the last three months of the fiscal year and had to dip into the Commission\u2019s savings. This year, he said he won\u2019t be able to do so.",
      "Then, last Friday, he found out the Commission had lost an almost $1 million grant he expected, again because of the federal government\u2019s cost cutting.",
      "He had planned to use the money to rebuild one of the two county senior centers, an aging 1980s-era doublewide trailer with limited seating.",
      "\u201cOnce the money\u2019s gone, you know, the money\u2019s gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Seniors at the center gather each weekday for lunch. Usually, they might play bingo or cards. On this day, because of the presence of a reporter from The Associated Press, the conversation turned to politics.",
      "Many are Trump supporters. Every county in West Virginia supported Trump in three presidential elections.",
      "Yet all agreed that the recent flurry of executive orders had been difficult to follow, especially since the county\u2019s last local newspaper shuttered, and they weren\u2019t sure what effect they\u2019d have on their lives.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand a lot of the stuff that\u2019s going on right now, and I just can\u2019t pinpoint things together, you know,\u201d said Brenda Hughes, 72, who said she usually goes to the Social Security office in person anyway because she said she\u2019s found it difficult to get a hold of the call center. \u201cBut maybe it\u2019s meant to be like that.\u201d",
      "Mary Weaver, 72, said she doesn\u2019t approve of Trump giving Elon Musk so much leeway to cut and change services, and she doesn\u2019t see those measures helping McDowell County.",
      "\u201cHe gone run for president, and he\u2019s going to get the presidency, but he\u2019s going to let someone else tell him how to run the country?\u201d she asked, criticizing Trump\u2019s relationship with Musk.",
      "Other residents aren't concerned. Barbara Lester, 64, said she wishes she could sit down with Trump and Musk and tell them they\u2019re doing a fantastic job.",

      "\u201cIf I ask people more than two times to take me somewhere, it\u2019s like begging. And I don\u2019t beg nobody to do nothing for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m independent like that. I don\u2019t beg nobody for nothing.\"",

      "Investigators had named Yolanda Olejniczak Marodi as the prime suspect in the Feb. 17 stabbing death of Cal Fire Capt. Rebecca Marodi, 49, in Ramona, near San Diego.",
      "Olejniczak Marodi was arrested Saturday at a hotel in the city of Mexicali, just south of the U.S. border, according to officials in Mexico. Mexican state security agents transferred her to U.S. marshals and she was returned to the United States, according to a statement from the San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "It wasn't known Sunday if Olejniczak Marodi, 53, has an attorney.",
      "She will be booked into custody in San Diego, and the investigation into Marodi\u2019s killing remains ongoing, the statement said.",
      "Marodi, a decorated captain with the state agency, was part of the battle against the Eaton fire in January near Los Angeles. She and Olejniczak Marodi had been married for just over two years.",
      "Olejniczak Marodi was previously convicted in the fatal stabbing of her then-husband, James Joseph Olejniczak, the Los Angeles Times reported. She pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter after the stabbing in 2000 and served nearly a decade in prison.",
      "Olejniczak Marodi had been at large since Marodi\u2019s death and had driven into Mexico the night of her death, according to the statement from the sheriff\u2019s office. She was seen on surveillance video earlier in the evening \u201carguing with Rebecca and physically assaulting her\u201d before leaving the house, the statement said.",
      "Home security footage from a surveillance camera at the couple\u2019s home depicted a brutal scene on the evening of Feb. 17, according to an arrest warrant obtained by the Times. A woman believed to be Marodi can be heard in the video screaming \u201cYolanda! Please ... ! I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d before appearing on video with blood on her back, according to the warrant.",
      "The footage shows Olejniczak Marodi packing items into a silver SUV, which is seen about an hour later crossing the border into Mexico, according to the warrant.",

      "A jury in Georgia has ordered Monsanto parent Bayer to pay nearly $2.1 billion in damages to a man who says the company\u2019s Roundup weed killer caused his cancer",
      "NEW YORK -- A jury in Georgia has ordered Monsanto parent Bayer to pay nearly $2.1 billion in damages to a man who says the company's Roundup weed killer caused his cancer, according to attorneys representing the plaintiff.",
      "The verdict marks the latest in a long-running series of court battles Monsanto has faced over its Roundup herbicide. The agrochemical giant says it will appeal the verdict, reached in a Georgia courtroom late Friday, in efforts to overturn the decision.",
      "The penalties awarded include $65 million in compensatory damages and $2 billion in punitive damages, law firms Arnold & Itkin LLP and Kline & Specter PC said in a statement. That marks one of the largest verdicts in a Roundup-related case to date.",
      "Plaintiff John Barnes filed his lawsuit against Monsanto in 2021, seeking damages related to his non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Arnold & Itkin attorney Kyle Findley, the lead trial lawyer on the case, said the verdict will help put his client in a better position to get the treatment he needs going forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road for him ... and he was happy that the truth related to the product (has) been exposed,\u201d Findley told The Associated Press on Sunday. He called the verdict an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d after \"another example of Monsanto\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for poisoning people with this toxic product.\u201d",
      "Germany-based Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in 2018, has continued to dispute claims that Roundup causes cancer. But the company has been hit with more than 177,000 lawsuits involving the weedkiller and set aside $16 billion to settle cases.",
      "In a statement, Monsanto said Friday's verdict \u201cconflicts with the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and the consensus of regulatory bodies and their scientific assessments worldwide.\u201d The company added that it continues \u201cto stand fully behind the safety\u201d of Roundup products.",
      "For a variety of crops \u2014 including corn, soybeans and cotton \u2014 Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist the weedkiller\u2019s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less.",
      "Some studies associate Roundup\u2019s key ingredient, glyphosate, with cancer, although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. Still, numerous lawsuits over the weedkiller allege glyphosate does cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma, arguing that Monsanto has failed to warn the public about serious risks for years.",
      "Findley said that evidence relating to Barnes' case show \u201cmany years of cover-ups\" and \u201cbackroom dealings.\u201d He accused Monsanto of ignoring several scientific studies related to the toxicity of Roundup and said the company \u201ctried to find ways to persuade and distract and deny the connection between this product and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\u201d",
      "Friday's decision marks the fourth Roundup-related verdict that Findley's team has won to date \u2014 the largest of which was awarded in Philadelphia in January 2024, with damages totaling $2.25 billion. And he said his law firm has \u201cmany more clients who are similarly situated as Mr. Barnes.\u201d",
      "Monsanto, meanwhile, also maintains that it \u201cremains committed to trying cases\u201d \u2014 and argues its wider record of Roundup-related litigation continues to reinforce the safety of its products. The company said it has prevailed in 17 of the last 25 related trials and \u201cjury verdicts were reduced 90% overall\u201d in past cases that have been finalized.",
      "Bayer has recently renewed and expanded an effort across a handful of U.S. states to protect pesticide companies from claims they failed to warn that a product causes cancer, if labeling otherwise complies with EPA regulations. The company and other industry supports argue that litigation costs are unstainable and could impact Roundup\u2019s future availability. But opponents stress that such legislation would limit accountability.",

      "Abortion has been top of mind for many voters casting early ballots in the race for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court",
      "MILWAUKEE -- As the candidates for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat squared off in a recent debate before early voting, one issue came up first and dominated at the start.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s talk about abortion rights,\u201d the moderator said.",
      "The winner of the April 1 election could hold the power to determine the fate of any future litigation over abortion because the outcome of the race for a vacancy on the state's highest court will decide whether liberals or conservatives hold a majority.",
      "Abortion has become a central plank of the platform for the Democratic-backed candidate, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, in part because of its effect on voter turnout, although to a lesser extent than during a heated 2023 state Supreme Court race that flipped the court to a liberal majority. Brad Schimel, a former state attorney general, is the Republican-supported candidate.",
      "\u201cAbortion of course remains a top issue,\u201d said Charles Franklin, a Marquette University political scientist. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t seen either candidate be as outspoken on hot-button issues as we saw in 2023.\u201d",
      "Democrats are hoping voters will be motivated by the potential revival of an abortion ban from 1849, which criminalizes \u201cthe willful killing of an unborn quick child.\u201d The Wisconsin Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to reactivate the 175-year-old ban.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the court to rule on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state.",
      "The 19th century law was enacted just a year after Wisconsin became a state, when lead mining and the lumber industry formed the bedrock of the state\u2019s economy as white settlers rushed into areas left vacant by forced removals of Native American tribes.",
      "It also was a time when combinations of herbs stimulating uterine contractions were the most common abortion method, said Kimberly Reilly, a history and gender studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.",
      "\u201cDuring this time, there were no women in statehouses,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cWhen a woman got married, she lost her legal identity. Her husband became her legal representative. She couldn\u2019t own property in her name. She couldn\u2019t make a contract.\u201d",
      "This is the latest instance of long-dormant restrictions influencing current abortion policies after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, which had granted a federal right to abortion.",
      "The revival of an 1864 Arizona abortion law, enacted when Arizona was a territory, sparked a national outcry last year. Century-old abortion restrictions passed by all-male legislatures during periods when women could not vote \u2014 and scientific knowledge of pregnancy and abortion were limited \u2014 have also influenced post-Roe abortion policies in Alabama, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia.",
      "Those laws tend to be more severe. They often do not include exceptions for rape and incest, call for the imprisonment of providers and ban the procedure in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Some have since been repealed, while others are being challenged in court.",
      "During the state Supreme Court debate March 12, Crawford declined to weigh in directly on the 1849 abortion case but promoted her experience representing Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and \u201cmaking sure that women could make their own choices about their bodies and their health care.\u201d In an ad released Wednesday, she accused Schimel of not trusting \u201cwomen to make their own healthcare decisions.\u201d",
      "Schimel calls himself \u201cpro-life\u201d and has previously supported leaving Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban on the books. He dodged questions about abortion during the debate, saying he believes the issue should be left up to voters, although Wisconsin does not have a citizen-led ballot initiative process, which voters in several other states have used to protect abortion rights.",
      "Anthony Chergosky, a University of Wisconsin-La Crosse political scientist, said Schimel has been \u201cborrowing from the Republican playbook of avoiding the issue of abortion\u201d by leaving the question to voters in individual states.",
      "The message has still gotten across to many Democratic voters, who cited abortion as a top issue while waiting in line for early voting this past week.",
      "Jane Delzer, a 75-year-old liberal voter in Waukesha, said \u201ca woman\u2019s right to choose is my biggest motivator. I\u2019m deeply worried about what Schimel may do on abortion.\u201d",
      "June Behrens, a 79-year-old retired teacher, spoke about a loved one\u2019s abortion experience: \u201cEveryone makes their own choice and has their own journey in life, and they deserve that right.\u201d",
      "Republican voters primarily cited immigration and the economy as their top issues, essentially the same ones that helped propel Republican Donald Trump's win over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris last November in the presidential election. But others said they also wanted conservative social views reflected on the court.",
      "Lewis Titus, a 72-year-old volunteer for the city of Eau Claire, said restricting abortion was his top issue in the Supreme Court race: \"I believe that Brad Schimel is the one to carry that on.\u201d",
      "While it's one of the key issues this year, abortion played a much larger role two years ago, when a race for Wisconsin\u2019s highest court demonstrated how expensive and nationalized state Supreme Court races have become.",
      "This year\u2019s campaigns have focused primarily on \u201ccriminal sentencing and attempting to paint one another as soft on crime,\u201d said Howard Schweber, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor emeritus.",
      "Crawford also has tried to make the race a referendum on Trump after his first months in office and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is running Trump\u2019s massive federal cost-cutting initiative and has funded two groups that have together spent more than $10 million to promote Schimel.",
      "\u201cTwo years ago, abortion was a hugely mobilizing issue, and we saw that clearly in the lead-up to the election,\u201d Schweber said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing some of this but not to the same extent, which really makes no sense. The issues and stakes are exactly the same.\u201d",
      "The decision to elevate other issues might be the result of anxiety among Democrats that abortion may not resonate as deeply as they once believed after significant election losses in November, despite Harris using abortion as a pillar of her campaign, several Wisconsin politics experts said.",
      "Charles Franklin, a Marquette University political scientist, said he believes abortion will motivate Democrats, but the issue may not rank high in the priorities of independent voters, who he says will be central to the race's outcome.",
      "\u201cIn the early days after Roe v. Wade was overturned, it was still a very hot issue for voters,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as states have codified their abortion laws, the issue doesn\u2019t seem to motivate voters to the same extent. In the fall, many Democrats believed abortion was still this magic silver bullet and would win them the presidential and Senate races. But the outcomes didn\u2019t seem to support that.\u201d",

      "The case, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, was brought by Voice of America reporters, Reporters Without Borders and a handful of unions against the U.S. Agency for Global Media and Kari Lake, the failed Arizona candidate who is President Trump's representative there.",
      "\u201cIn many parts of the world, a crucial source of objective news is gone, and only censored state-sponsored news media is left to fill the void,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "Lake has described the broadcast agency as a \u201cgiant rot\u201d that needs to be stripped down and rebuilt.",
      "Voice of America dates to World War II as a source of objective news, often beamed into authoritarian countries. Funded by Congress, it is protected by a charter that guarantees its product pass muster for journalistic rigor.",
      "The lawsuit charges that the Trump administration has effectively shut it down unlawfully in the past week. Republicans have complained that the news source is infected by left-wing propaganda, a contention its operators say isn't backed up factually.",
      "\u201cThe second Trump administration has taken a chainsaw to the agency as a whole in an attempt to shutter it completely,\u201d the lawsuit said. There was no immediate response Friday to a request for comment from the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and a handful of sister networks.",
      "In an interview with Newsmax earlier this week, Lake described Voice of America as \u201clike having a rotten fish and trying to find a portion that you can eat.\u201d",

      "The phrase \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d",
      "The phrase \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d has been expressed by protesters from the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising in China to those who opposed COVID-19 restrictions in the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Malcolm X referenced it in his 1964 \u201cBallot or the Bullet\u201d speech, demanding equal rights for Black Americans. President Donald Trump quoted it on his Truth Social platform last year, lambasting a judge during his criminal hush money trial.",
      "The phrase was reportedly first used 250 years ago Sunday by lawyer and legislator Patrick Henry to persuade Virginia colonists to prepare for war against an increasingly punitive Great Britain, just weeks before the American Revolution.",
      "Tensions were coming to a boil, particularly in Massachusetts, where the British replaced elected officials, occupied Boston and shuttered the harbor.",
      "\u201cThe entire episode was about helping our brethren in Massachusetts,\u201d said historian John Ragosta, who wrote a book on Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s about the community. It\u2019s about the nation. It\u2019s not about, \u2018What do I get out of this personally?\u2019\u201d",
      "The printed version of Henry\u2019s galvanizing speech in a crowded church was about 1,200 words. And yet those seven words have survived the centuries like a line from a Shakespeare play.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very malleable phrase,\u201d said Patrick Henry Jolly, a fifth great grandson of Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s something that can be applied to many different circumstances. But I think it\u2019s important that people understand the original context.\u201d",
      "Jolly is set to reenact Henry\u2019s speech Sunday in the same church where his ancestor delivered it. The presentation, which will be streamed online, is part of Virginia's commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the nation's birth.",
      "Here's more information on Henry and his speech:",
      "Born to an influential Virginia family in 1736, Henry became a successful trial lawyer in his 20s.",
      "According to the Library of Congress, he once astonished a courtroom with an argument that \u201cman is born with certain inalienable rights,\u201d an idea echoed in the Declaration of Independence.",
      "In 1765, Henry won a seat in Virginia's colonial legislature. He was instrumental in opposing Great Britain's Stamp Act, which levied a direct tax on the American colonies to raise money for Britain.",
      "As tensions increased, many Americans felt like second-class citizens with no representation in parliament, Ragosta said. By the time of Henry's speech, many were thinking: \"The king won\u2019t listen to us. They\u2019ve invaded Boston. What should we in Virginia do about that?\"",
      "In his 2004 book, \u201cFounding Myths,\u201d historian Ray Raphael wrote \u201cit is highly unlikely\u201d Henry said, \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d",
      "Henry did not write down the speech and the version we know today was published 42 years later in an 1817 biography of him. The biographer, attorney William Wirt, pieced together Henry's words from the decades-old recollections of people who were there.",
      "The printed version, Raphael wrote, \u201creflects the agendas of 19th century nationalists who were fond of romanticizing war.\u201d",
      "But other historians said there is ample evidence Henry uttered those words.",
      "\u201cWe have multiple people, years later, saying, \u2018I remember like it was yesterday,'\" Ragosta said, adding that Thomas Jefferson was one of them.",
      "They recalled Henry lifting a letter opener that looked like a dagger and plunging it under his arm as if into his chest before saying the famous phrase.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s 18th century oratory,\" Ragosta said. \u201dIt\u2019s very impassioned.\"",
      "Jon Kukla, another historian who wrote a book on Henry, cited other evidence. Men in Virginia's militias soon embroidered their heavy canvas shirts with \u201cliberty or death.\u201d",
      "The popular 1712 play \u201cCato\u201d about a Roman senator also contains the line, \u201cIt is not now a time to talk of aught, but chains or conquest, liberty or death.\"",
      "\u201cIt would have been part of the literate culture of the age,\u201d Kukla said.",
      "The most immediate impact of Henry's speech was more support for independence and the expansion of Virginia's militias.",
      "In the months afterward, Henry and others also were driven by fears that the British would free enslaved people, Raphael suggests in \u201cFounding Myths.\"",
      "Virginia\u2019s royal governor, Lord Dunmore, offered freedom to enslaved people who fought for the British.",
      "But Ragosta said that was not a primary motivation for Henry, who enslaved dozens of people.",
      "\u201cThat does move a lot of people off the fence into the patriot column, undoubtedly,\u201d Ragosta said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really what\u2019s going on with the Jeffersons, the Washingtons, the Henrys. They had already been very committed to the patriot movement.\u201d",
      "Following independence, Henry served as Virginia's governor five times. He also became known as an anti-federalist, opposing ratification of the U.S. Constitution and a strong central government.",
      "But Henry later spoke in support of the founding document at George Washington's urging in 1799, the year Henry died.",
      "\u201cHe says, \u2018Look, I voted against the Constitution, but we the people voted for it. And so we have to abide by it,\u2019\u201d Ragosta said.",
      "Jolly, Henry's descendant, said most people react positively to his ancestor's famous words and acknowledge their historical significance.",
      "\u201cAnd there are some people that react thinking that it's a rallying cry for them today to defend their rights \u2014 on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Jolly said.",
      "Yet Henry and his contemporaries were careful to distinguish liberty from license, said Kukla, the historian.",
      "\u201cLiberty, as they understood it, was not the freedom to do anything you damn well pleased,\" Kukla said.",

    "story": [
      "As President Donald Trump's administration seeks to roll back funding for transit, walking and biking projects, some states are trying to advance them on their own",
      "CHICAGO -- Hundreds of bicycle advocates were at an annual summit this month in Washington, D.C., when their cellphones lit up over breakfast with an urgent email warning that President Donald Trump's transportation department had just halted federal grant funding for bike lanes.",
      "As the administration targets green energy projects championed by former President Joe Biden that boosted transit, recreational trails and bicycle infrastructure, several states are banding together to advance those priorities on their own.",
      "California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Pennsylvania joined forces for a national organizing effort dubbed the Clean Rides Network. The group gained momentum in various statehouses this year on environmentally friendly transportation projects it contends the federal government has abandoned.",
      "\u201cThese are changes we need to make anyway, but they\u2019re more urgent than ever,\u201d said Justin Balik, senior state program director for the environmental advocacy group Evergreen Action and one of the organizers of the Clean Rides Network. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling the state departments of transportation the next frontier of climate advocacy.\u201d",
      "Although Colorado wasn't among the seven charter members of the Clean Rides Network, a policy enacted there set the framework for one of its most ambitious goals.",
      "In 2021, Gov. Jared Polis committed to a dramatic reduction in Colorado's greenhouse gas emissions and employed a novel approach to accelerate the timeline. Whenever the state's transportation department commits money to a large-scale project that increases vehicle traffic such as a new highway, it must also pursue a corresponding project to offset the environmental harms.",
      "Two major highway expansion projects were canceled because of the policy, said Matt Frommer of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. The group advocated for the change.",
      "Colorado used the savings to expand an intercity bus service that has soared in popularity for urban residents and tourists traveling to ski resorts.",
      "Polis' vision lined up with the multimodal transportation aims under the $1.1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law Biden signed that year. In the final months of Biden's administration, the city of Denver won a $150 million federal grant to build a rapid transit bus line along one of its busiest corridors.",
      "Frommer, a transportation and land use policy manager, said there are fears that states will now have to pursue projects like that on their own.",
      "\u201cIf your state cares about climate change, you need to take the reins and step up and direct your transportation funds to projects that are going to reduce emissions,\" Frommer said. \u201cWe may not be able to rely on the federal government to put that policy in place or to really help you in many ways.\u201d",
      "Minnesota followed Colorado's lead and adopted a similar rule to offset greenhouse emissions. Other states that are part of the network are pushing proposals this session.",
      "The Maryland House recently passed its version of the Colorado law, and Senate sponsor Shelly Hettleman said she's cautiously optimistic it will win final passage before lawmakers adjourn.",
      "In trying to persuade her colleagues, Hettleman has focused less on the environmental benefits than what she sees as economic ones. A study commissioned by the Colorado transportation department projected up to $40 billion in savings through improved air quality, road safety and reduced traffic congestion, among other things.",
      "Lawmakers in the Clean Rides states of Illinois and Massachusetts have advanced similar proposals, but they've encountered resistance from some business leaders and advocates for road construction.",
      "\u201cThis is another ill-advised piece of legislation, not based upon science, that will defer needed improvements to our crumbling transportation infrastructure in Illinois,\" said Mike Sturino, president and CEO of the Illinois Road and Transportation Builders Association. \u201cCommuters will have to wait for improvements to our existing interstate system, as this bill would delay addressing unsafe conditions on our roads and bridges.\u201d",
      "Although most of the state leaders who have pushed alternative transportation options have been Democrats, the Clean Rides Network said more conservative states have shown interest in some of the topics, too.",
      "Just as Colorado's anticipated cost savings helped spur legislation in Maryland, economic concerns continue to be foremost in the minds of residents, with some studies showing that transportation ranks second to housing in consumer costs.",
      "\u201cForget about the cost of eggs. It\u2019s never been more expensive to drive a car,\u201d said Miguel Moravec with the nonprofit climate think tank RMI, which created a calculator to help states project the money they could save through policies that reduce emissions.",
      "Virginia employs a scale that scores potential transportation projects based on factors such as safety, congestion relief, and environmental impacts.",
      "Utah launched an ambitious transit plan for the rapidly growing state, while Montana implemented land use and zoning reforms that made cities more walkable.",
      "Muhammed Patel, senior transportation advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Chicago, said states are at least rethinking some of their policy priorities.",
      "\u201cWe do live luckily in a country where states have authority over their own transportation systems,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThere\u2019s flexibility innately built in.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Pizza Hut workers are accusing a franchise of ''blatantly unlawful'' behaviour alleging it has altered timesheets, docked wages and stopped payments per delivery.",
      "Glenshire Group which runs all 22 Pizza Hut delivery outlets in Scotland has been served with a grievance by the Unite union on behalf of drivers who claim they were told of changes by text with no consultation.",
      "Delivery driver, Cian, told the BBC that Glenshire had shown ''a complete disdain for their staff and their customers'' and said it was ''quite honestly abysmal''.",
      "Glenshire said it is \"absolutely committed to robust employment practices\" and said it is \"listening to our colleagues, to understand where there are concerns\".",
      "Cian, 30, has been delivering pizzas in the west of Glasgow for more than two years. An employee of Pizza Hut franchise, Glenshire Group, he has always been paid the National Living Wage plus a fee of \u00a31.45 per delivery.",
      "But he said his terms and conditions were changed without consultation or warning.",
      "He said two weeks ago he and several other drivers were told via text message that his pay had increased to \u00a312.21 an hour but he had lost his \u00a31.45 delivery payments, or what the company calls \"discretionary driver commissions\".",
      "''The \u00a31.45 would pay for my fuel and a tiny bit of the running cost of my car but I've been living paycheque to paycheque,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We had multiple drivers just quit because they simply can't afford to do this job if they're having to pay for their own fuel. There's one shop that has lost every single one of their drivers.''",
      "In a letter to staff dated 10 March, seen by the BBC, Glenshire said: \"We have removed discretionary driver commissions with effect from today. This change is necessary to ensure the sustainability of our operations.\"",
      "The letter does not state that the company has any plans in place to ensure drivers' expenses will be paid by Glenshire.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the company said that ''driver commissions have not been reduced, rather the remuneration model has changed from a 'per delivery' amount to a 'per mile' basis\".",
      "'Attempt to offload drivers'",
      "Unite's head of hospitality, Bryan Simpson has accused Glenshire of ''a cynical attempt to offload over 100 drivers'' before the rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs), the National Minimum Wage (NMW) and the National Living Wage on 1 April.",
      "Among the increases next month, the National Living Wage for people aged 21 and over will rise from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21.",
      "\"I have never seen something so blatantly unlawful occur, even in an industry, frankly, that is not known for decent workers rights. This is the worst that I've came across in over a decade,\" Mr Simpson said.",
      "He said the loss of drivers' commission per delivery could effectively mean that \"these workers are going to be brought below the minimum wage.",
      "\"They're going to be losing thousands of pounds a year. So, as far as we are concerned, this is fire and rehire under a different name.''",
      "'Not worth me keeping my job'",
      "Unite's grievance, seen exclusively by the BBC, also accused Glenshire of acting ''fraudulently'' by going into old staff timesheets and retroactively adding unpaid 20 minute rest breaks.",
      "In a text message seen by the BBC, Glenshire director Zibby Ghafoor told store managers ''all time sheets have been deleted for last week..can we please add breaks in.\"",
      "Unite claims Glenshire unlawfully deducted these breaks from their wages.",
      "In its statement, Glenshire said that there have been \"no changes to break policies\".",
      "A manager called Adam, not his real name, said he works for hours on his own in his store. He said it's simply not possible to take breaks.",
      "\"You do not get your 20 minutes of uninterrupted time ever...so not only do we not get breaks, we now get charged for the breaks that we don't take.''",
      "Cian says it's his ''civic duty'' to speak out even though he knows it could put him at risk of losing his job. ''I'm trying to help people who can't stand up for themselves, because the way the Glenshire group have treated everyone is abysmal. The long term ramifications of what they are doing, it's just not worth me keeping my job.''",
      "Glenshire Group employs more than 200 staff including more than 100 delivery drivers although over the last few days, the BBC understands several have quit.",
      "In the 10 March letter to staff, Glenshire said that with the increases in employer NICs and the National Living Wage rise on 1 April it was having to \"reassess our driver delivery model in order to retain business viability\".",
      "It also said drivers could choose to switch from being employed to self-employed.",
      "The letter stressed this would be a voluntary choice and would not be compulsory. Glenshire last night told the BBC there were \"no blanket changes to self-employed contracts taking place\".",
      "Call to investigate",
      "Employment lawyer Joanne Moseley of Irwin Mitchell warned that from 1 April, when the new National Living Wage is introduced, Glenshire could be in breach of minimum wage regulations.",
      "\"If Glenshire doesn't reimburse its drivers for payments they've incurred in connection with their employment - in this case their petrol expenses - they will be in breach of the NMW regulations. HMRC will investigate and has the power to impose financial penalties,\" she says.",
      "Adam called on bosses of the Pizza Hut company to investigate the Glenshire franchise.",
      "\"Please be aware of what this company are doing to your brand. Please be aware of what they're doing to the staff and all for their own benefit, all to save them money,\" he said.",
      "A spokesperson for Pizza Hut UK said: \"Pizza Hut is deeply committed to ensuring a safe and fair working environment for all employees and as such has strict policies in place that its franchise businesses must adhere to.",
      "\"Although Glenshire Group operates as an independent franchisee and is ultimately responsible for its own employment practices, we take these allegations seriously.",
      "\"Glenshire will be actively engaging in the coming days with any concerned employees, and we will continue to investigate this situation.\""

      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about Wednesday's economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before President Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",

      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",
      "What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving.",
      "On Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and artificial intelligence.",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",

    "story": [
      "The prime minister has said he is \"deeply concerned\" about the closure of Heathrow Airport as a result of a power cut caused by a fire at a nearby electrical substation.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC \"there are questions\" for bosses of the UK's largest airport to answer over the 18-hour long closure on Friday, which disrupted the journeys of some 200,000 passengers.",
      "On Monday, Heathrow defended its decision to shut down following claims that it did have enough power to operate after the substation fire.",
      "The airport said it had to ground flights due to the time it took to switch from the damaged substation to two alternative power supplies, but added \"lessons can and will be learned\".",
      "The impact of Friday's fire from a single power source has raised questions over Heathrow's resilience and disaster plans, which sees thousands of passengers and millions of pounds worth of trade pass through its four terminals on a daily basis.",
      "The airport, along with National Grid, which oversees the UK's electricity network, agreed the impact of fire which broke out at the substation in Hayes was unprecedented.",
      "But John Pettigrew, chief executive of National Grid, told the Financial Times that two other substations remained operational and capable of powering the airport.",
      "He said he could not recall a transformer failing to such an extent in his 30-year career, but said there was a \"level of resilience\" provided by two other substations.",
      "\"Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow,\" he said.",

      "\"I don't want to see an airport as important as Heathrow going down in the way it did on Friday, so I'm not comfortable with that for one second,\" he added.",
      "An investigation has been ordered by the government to establish what happened, with initial findings to be provided within six weeks.",
      "An internal review of the airport's crisis management plans and its response will also be undertaken by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, who is an independent member of Heathrow's board.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told the BBC the airport's \"well designed\" resilience plans had worked as intended, but added they were never designed to protect the entire energy supply for the whole airport.",
      "Asked if she had confidence in Heathrow's leadership team after reports some senior management went back to bed, leaving the decision to close the airport to more junior executives, Alexander said it was \"not a matter for me\".",
      "She said she understood Heathrow's chief operating officer, Javier Echave, was \"taking some of the critical decisions\" early on Friday, but that she got a \"pretty much instantaneous response\" when she requested to speak to the chief executive Thomas Woldbye.",
      "\"The individuals who need to ask themselves whether they have full confidence in Heathrow management are the Heathrow board,\" the transport secretary added.",
      "The BBC has contacted the airport regarding the reports.",
      "Investigation ordered into power outage that closed Heathrow",
      "National Grid boss says Heathrow had 'enough power'",
      "Heathrow has emergency back-up power supplies, which use diesel generators and batteries, but these only keep crucial safety systems running, such as landing equipment and runway lights.",
      "A separate biomass power generator also provides heat and electricity to Terminal Two.",

      "\"Given Heathrow's size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge,\" a spokesperson said on Monday.",
      "\"Our objective was to reopen as soon as safely and practically possible after the fire.\"",

      "Heathrow closure: What are my rights?",
      "Willie Walsh, the former British Airways boss and head of the airline organisation IATA said on Friday it was a \"clear planning failure by the airport\".",
      "The BBC has since contacted the major airlines operating out of Heathrow's terminals to ask how much Friday's closure cost, but all approached have declined to comment or not responded.",
      "It is understood there are concerns within the industry however that there is no mechanism of recouping such costs from the airport responsible, when disruption to flights is out of the control of airlines."

      "English councils will be ranked according to their pothole fixing progress under government plans, with those who fail to publish updates losing out on millions in funding.",
      "The Department for Transport (DfT) said local authorities' road maintenance pot would be boosted by \u00a3500m from mid-April, but councils must publish annual reports detailing progress on potholes or lose a quarter of that extra funding.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC this would produce a rating system \"so we know who is the best and who is not the best\".",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said the government should focus on preventative measures rather than \"reactively\" fixing potholes.",
      "Clearing the country's backlog of road repairs would take more than a decade and cost almost \u00a317bn to fix, the LGA said, citing a survey from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.",
      "According to data from the RAC, there are six potholes for every mile of road in England and Wales.",
      "All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.",
      "The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.",
      "The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC a RAG (red, amber, green) rating system would be produced for councils on pothole maintenance.",
      "He said that \"until now, nobody has known how many potholes are being filled and where they're being filled\".",
      "\"We all have the experience of driving from one place to the next and we know some places are better than others,\" he said, adding that the RAG system will help to avoid \"the lottery that we have now\".",
      "'Not helpful'",
      "However, Lucy Nethsingha, leader of Cambridgeshire County Council and chair of the LGA's Liberal Democrat group, said the amount of money was \"nowhere near the amount that is needed\".",
      "\"The implication that we are not spending it well is not helpful,\" she said, adding that the government was announcing \"stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics\".",
      "\"It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful,\" she said.",
      "She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall \u00a3410m while the money the government was \"re-announcing\" for the whole of England was \u00a3500m.",
      "\"Our roads are like a worn out pair of trousers, you can keep fixing the holes, but what you actually need is a new pair of trousers - or in this case a proper resurfacing.\"",
      "But the prime minister said \"any council that says to me it's not enough money, I'd say come back to see me in June when you've actually filled these potholes in with your RAG rating and then we'll see if we can release more money to you\".",
      "\"Don't start the exercise complaining that you haven't got enough money.\"",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"not pretending that the money we're making available will fill every pothole\".",
      "Asked whether withholding cash from some councils would just make things worse for drivers in some areas, she said she expected most local authorities would be able to \"comply with these requirements\".",
      "\"We want councils to be open and honest about how they are using that money so that the public can go onto their local council's website and see what action is being taken,\" she said.",
      "Under the government's rules, councils must say how much they are spending, how many potholes have been filled and detail long-term road maintenance plans in reports that have to be published by the end of June.",
      "By the end of October, councils must also demonstrate that communities have been consulted on where repairs should take place.",
      "The DfT added that councils who \"fail to meet these strict conditions\" will see 25% of the funding withheld.",
      "During the election campaign, Labour pledged to repair up to a million potholes a year in England.",
      "'Preventative measures'",
      "The LGA said it was in \"everyone's interests to ensure that public money is well spent\".",
      "\"This includes the government playing its full part by using the Spending Review to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures rather than reactively fixing potholes, which is more expensive,\" it added.",
      "Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon described the government's announcement as a \"pothole sticking plaster\".",
      "He said: \"Labour like to talk a big game on fixing roads but they are more interested in chasing headlines.\"",

      "Welfare spending",

      "Tax changes",

      "However, the OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "The pressure on Reeves grew on Friday, when it was announced that UK government borrowing was higher than expected in February, at \u00a310.7bn.",

      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",

    "story": [
      "UK government borrowing was higher than expected in February, adding pressure to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her Spring Statement next week.",
      "Borrowing - the difference between spending and income from taxes - was \u00a310.7bn last month, according to official figures.",
      "The government's independent forecaster had predicted that borrowing would be \u00a36.5bn for the month.",
      "Reeves is expected to announce spending cuts next week to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy, which the Treasury reiterated were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "\"We must go further and faster to create an agile and productive state that works for people,\" said Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, adding that the government \"will never play fast and loose with the public finances\".",
      "However, economists have warned the higher-than-expected borrowing last month \"puts more pressure\" on the Chancellor ahead of the Spring Statement on Wednesday.",
      "What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?",
      "Dennis Tatarkov, senior economist at KPMG, said the latest borrowing figures raised the risk of Reeves missing her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Most governments in wealthy nations have such rules, which are designed to reassure investors and maintain credibility with financial markets.",
      "Reeves's two main rules are: not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending; and to get debt falling as a share of the UK economic output by 2029/30.",
      "Isabel Stockton, senior researcher for the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said Reeves had \"boxed herself in with promises to meet her fiscal targets, not to raise taxes further and not to return to austerity for public services\".",
      "She added that \"easy or risk-free options for the Chancellor are in short supply\".",
      "Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics, said he expected further spending cuts \"on top of the welfare cuts already unveiled\".",
      "At the Budget in October, the government's official forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) indicated Reeves had \u00a39.9bn available to spend against her borrowing rules.",
      "But next week the OBR will be likely to conclude the chancellor's buffer has been \"wiped out\", Mr Kerr added.",
      "Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the UK's \"weak public finances mean spending cuts in the Spring Statement\", and added that \"taxes will rise in October\".",
      "This week the government revealed plans for major changes to the benefits system aimed generating savings of \u00a35bn a year in response to the UK's growing welfare bill.",

      "The prime minister has also announced NHS England will be scrapped, along with some other arms-length government bodies.",
      "But aside from spending cuts, the government has said it will increase defence spending, though the funds are being reallocated from the international aid budget.",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said the latest borrowing figures were \"yet another major blow to the Chancellor's faltering plan for growth, and show her approach is simply not working\".",
      "She added National Insurance increases for employers, set to come into effect in April, would \"hammer small businesses\".",

      "They will be able to use the allowance through a nannying and babysitting app for the rest of 2025.",
      "\"We really, really would like to attract more female drivers onto the Uber platform,\" said Uber UK General Manager Andrew Brem.",

      "\"If Uber really wanted to support families, they would pay drivers enough money so that they could afford time off to be with their children,\" it told the BBC in a statement.",
      "\"Instead Uber's insultingly low fees force drivers to spend so long on the roads that in many cases relationships rupture and families are broken up,\" it added.",
      "Uber said it trialled free childcare with 1,000 drivers and had an overwhelmingly positive response - with 96% of those who took part saying it made it easier to take on work.",
      "Now, the scheme will be extended to the more than 100,000 Uber drivers in the UK.",
      "\"Like some other occupations, [Uber driving] happens to be predominantly male - that's not something that we'd like,\" Mr Brem told BBC News.",
      "He expects the free childcare to initially be used by existing drivers rather than new ones, \"but it's more, I think, to get drivers into the habit of doing this.\"",

      "In October, Uber drivers in Glasgow told the BBC their wages had fallen in 2024, despite price increases being passed on to customers.",
      "Then in January, striking drivers said they were working \"too many hours\" despite having families at home.",
      "\"I haven't yet come across an employee survey, including our own, where people don't say that they want to earn more,\" said Mr Brem.",
      "\"I do understand that our main role in helping them more, though, is to is to keep the platform super busy, so our focus is on actually growth of demand,\" he said.",
      "Mr Brem said drivers could now see a weekly breakdown of how much money they earned compared to how much of the fare Uber takes.",
      "He added that, coming out of lockdowns, there was a period of \"unusually higher earnings\" for drivers, as demand outstripped supply of available rides.",
      "\"We're more in a sort of normal situation now, but that probably affects some of the experiences that [drivers] have had,\" he says.",
      "Uber has also highlighted the experience of one mother of three who participated in its childcare pilot and said it had been a \"massive boost\".",
      "Tania Naseer said she used the childcare during work and also to go out with friends.",
      "\"As a mother, it's important for me to have my own batteries charged in order to be there for my children,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"Now, I can hire a sitter for the weekend and then I can work the weekend, and they are the busiest hours.\"",
      "She added: \"Ideally, yes, a pay rise would be great, but right now it seems to be working how it is.\"",
      "The childcare will be offered through a babysitting and nannying app called Bubble, which matches parents with childminders.",
      "Drivers can use the free hours whenever they want, not just when they are working for Uber.",

      "This filter appeared on my TikTok \"For You\" page the other day despite me not engaging with any weight-related or health content.",
      "After I watched the video and read the comments, TikTok began to suggest similar videos from other people using the filter, and even another where AI can turn you thinner.",

      "\"Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that Boeing's conduct would result in PTSD and John's unbearable depression... Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death,\" it says.",

      "It describes how he was allegedly harassed, denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn and contempt, as well as being removed from investigations he was working on and blacklisted from transferring to other quality control positions within the company.",
      "Mr Barnett took early retirement from Boeing in March 2017, at a time when the claim says he had been suffering from symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, and knew he was going to be fired. The lawsuit alleges the company continued to put pressure on him, for example by preventing friends who continued to work there from having any contact with him.",

      "The Bank of England has warned economic and global trade uncertainty has \"intensified\" as it held UK interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "US trade tariffs and retaliation to the import taxes from the likes of the EU have created uncertainty for countries, the Bank said.",
      "Its decision to hold rates was widely expected, but governor Andrew Bailey said the Bank still believed rates were \"on a gradually declining path\".",
      "Economists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year, with many suggesting the next could come in May.",
      "Mr Bailey reiterated it was the Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\". Inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, currently remains above the Bank's 2% target, at 3%.",
      "The Bank's Monetary Policy committee (MPC), which sets rates, voted by a majority of eight to one in favour of holding at 4.5%.",
      "The base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The relatively higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so the latest decision will not have any immediate impact on monthly repayments.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, so they face higher repayment costs when deals end.",
      "Mortgage rates have been edging down recently. On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.33%, while the average five-year fix was 5.18%.",

      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "While inflation is much lower than in recent years, households are still feeling the pain of higher prices and are set to be hit by a host of higher bills for water, energy and council tax from April.",
      "Direct debit failures increased by 2% in February compared with January, driven in part by people missing loan and mortgage repayments, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "'Exporters are nervous'",
      "Trade tariffs imposed by the US also threaten to push up prices for UK businesses exporting across the Atlantic. The Bank said most firms were in \"wait and see\" mode, as they also face a hike in National Insurance contributions (NICs) next month.",
      "The Bank said UK exporters were \"nervous\" of the potential impact of tariffs.",
      "\"We'll be looking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving,\" Mr Bailey said.",
      "US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners, sparking a trade war with the likes of the EU and Canada.",
      "Trump has argued the measures will boost American industry but with tariffs being paid by the domestic company importing goods, economists say the measures could lead to price rises for consumers.",
      "The Bank said more firms were pausing or freezing hiring in the wake of tax rises and some had cut back on investment plans. It added pay growth for workers was set to ease over the year.",
      "There have been three rate cuts since August 2024 after previous hikes to try to combat high inflation, which was driven by energy and food prices soaring in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr Bailey said the Bank expected a \"bit of a pick-up\" in inflation this year but added it would gradually fall over time.",
      "\"We have to be quite careful at this point,\" he said, when questioned why rates had not been cut on Thursday.",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank has forecast inflation to rise further this year to 3.7%, and stay above its 2% target until the end of 2027.",
      "It previously halved its economic growth estimate for the year in a blow to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said there was \"still work to do to ease the cost of living\", adding she was \"determined to go further and faster\" to kickstart economic growth.",
      "But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget in October was to blame for inflation remaining above the Bank's target.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",

      "Internationally embarrassing",
      "Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.",
      "A source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.",
      "The systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.",
      "A Heathrow source said its back-up diesel generators and uninterruptable power supplies in place all operated as expected.",
      "The problem lay with the National Grid, the source said, pointing out thousands of homes had been left without power, not just the airport.",
      "There are two National Grid substations close to Heathrow: one at North Hyde, north of the airport, and one at Laleham, south of the airport, according to energy analysis firm Montel Group.",
      "It appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.",
      "\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"",
      "However, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports \u2013 Gatwick is the other \u2013 that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.",
      "\"These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,\" he said.",
      "In 2023, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended to the government that it should set standards for some key sectors of infrastructure such as telecoms, water, transport and energy by 2025.",
      "It followed up with a further report at the end of last year detailing how the government could do that for those sectors.",
      "\"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added.",
      "A Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated.",
      "Sometimes - like now -  a chain is only as important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow.",
      "Questions over whether additional back-ups are worth the additional cost will continue long after the passengers and cargo delayed by Friday's disruptive, and internationally embarrassing, failure have got where they are going.",
      "Additional reporting by Tom Espiner, Theo Leggett, Ben King, and Oliver Smith.",
      "Update 22 March: This article has been corrected to amend a reference to the amount of trade goods affected by the closure of Heathrow. It was millions of pounds worth of trade goods, not millions of tonnes as we originally stated."

    "summary": "Robo-taxi services and driverless trucks are gaining ground but progress is painstaking.",
    "story": [
      "Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral.",
      "To get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on.",
      "But he got much more attention than he bargained for.",
      "Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.",
      "The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.",
      "Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.",
      "\"Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?\" Mr Johns filmed himself asking.",
      "Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.",
      "Waymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem.",
      "The company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".",
      "Nevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.",
      "Last year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole.",
      "And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .",
      "The road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.",
      "In December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.",
      "GM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\".",
      "In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.",
      "Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.",
      "Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020.",
      "But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.",
      "Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.",
      "So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?",
      "\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.",
      "He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.",
      "\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"",
      "So what's next?",
      "Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.",
      "That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.",
      "\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.",
      "He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.",
      "\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says.",
      "It will be a slow process.",
      "\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker.",
      "\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds.",
      "And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.",
      "\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.",
      "For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.",
      "\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.",
      "\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.",
      "\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.",
      "\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.",
      "\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"",
      "To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China.",
      "In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.",
      "Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.",
      "\"There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.",
      "Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.",
      "\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0nr05yxmzo",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:27:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Could this be a chance for the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy to shed protectionism and open up further?",
    "story": [
      "India has usually turned to economic reforms in times of distress, with the most famous example being 1991, when the country embraced liberalisation in the face of a deep financial crisis.",
      "Now, with US President Donald Trump's tit-for-tat tariff wars and the global trade upheaval that has followed, many believe that India finds itself at another crossroad.",
      "Could this be a major opportunity for the world's fifth largest economy to shed its protectionism and further open up its economy? Will India seize the moment, just as it did more than three decades ago, or will it retreat further?",
      "Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. The problem is that India's trade-weighted import duties - the average duty rate per imported product - are among the highest in the world. The US average tariff is 2.2%, China's is 3% and Japan's is 1.7%. India's stands at a whopping 12%, according to data from the World Trade Organization.",
      "High tariffs increase costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hindering their ability to compete in international markets. They also mean that Indians pay more on imported goods than foreign consumers. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. However, with India's share of global exports at a mere 1.5%, the challenge becomes even more urgent.",
      "The jury is out on whether Trump's tariff war will help India break free or double down on protectionism. Narendra Modi's government, often criticised for its protectionist stance, already seems to have shifted gears.",
      "Last month, ahead of Prime Minister Modi's meeting with Trump in Washington, India unilaterally lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products.",
      "Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has made two trips to the US to discuss a potential trade deal, following Trump's threatened retaliatory tariffs, looming on 2 April. (Citi Research analysts estimate India could lose up to $7bn annually from reciprocal tariffs, primarily affecting sectors like metals, chemicals and jewellery, with pharmaceuticals, automobiles and food products also at risk.)",
      "Last week, Goyal urged Indian exporters to \"come out of their protectionist mindset and encouraged them to be bold and ready to deal with the world from a position of strength and self-confidence\", according to a statement from his ministry.",
      "India is also actively pursuing free trade deals with several countries, including the UK and New Zealand, and the European Union.",
      "In an interesting turn of events, homegrown telecoms giants Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have teamed up with Trump ally Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch satellite internet services via Starlink in India. The move surprised analysts, especially after Musk's recent clashes with both companies, and came as US and Indian officials negotiate the trade deal.",
      "India's rapid growth from the late 1990s to the 2000s - 8.1% between 2004-2009 and 7.46% from 2009-2014 - was in large part driven by its gradual integration into global markets, particularly in pharmaceuticals, software, autos, textiles and garments, alongside a steady reduction in tariffs. Since then, India has turned inwards.",
      "Many economists believe that protectionist policies over the past decade have undermined Modi's Make in India initiative, which prioritised capital- and technology-intensive sectors over labour-intensive ones like textiles. As a result, it has struggled to boost manufacturing and exports.",
      "High tariffs have also fostered protectionism in several Indian industries, discouraging investments in efficiency, according to Viral Acharya, a professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business.",
      "This has allowed \"cosy incumbents\" to gain market power by consolidating their positions without facing much competition. As Mr Acharya, a former central banker, noted in a paper by Brookings Institution, restoring industrial balance in India requires \"reducing tariffs to increase the country's share of global goods trade and reduce protectionism\".",
      "With India's tariffs already higher than those of most countries, further increases could be especially damaging.",
      "\"We need to boost exports and a tit-for-tat tariff war won't help us. China can afford this strategy due to its massive export base, but we can't, as we hold only a small share of the global market,\" Rajeswari Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said.  \"A trade conflict could hurt us more than others.\"",
      "In light of this, India finds itself at a crossroad. As the world undergoes a major shift, India has a \"unique opportunity to shape a new vision\" for global trade, says Aseema Sinha, a trade expert at Claremont McKenna College.",
      "By lowering protectionist barriers in South Asia and strengthening ties with Southeast Asia and the Middle East, India has the chance to lead in shaping a new trade vision, positioning itself as a key player in a \"re-globalised\" world, Ms Sinha, author of Globalising India, says.",
      "\"By reducing tariffs, India could become the regional and cross-regional magnet for trade and economic activity, drawing in varied powers in its orbit,\" she adds.",
      "That could help India create the jobs it desperately needs at home. Agriculture, which makes up 15% of its GDP, accounts for a whopping 40% of employment, reflecting extremely low productivity. Construction remains the second-largest employer, absorbing casual daily workers.",
      "India's challenge isn't in expanding its thriving service sector, which already makes up nearly half of total exports, but in dealing with the large pool of unskilled workers who lack the basic skills needed for service jobs.",
      "\"While high-end services are thriving, the majority of the workforce remains uneducated and underemployed, often relegated to construction or informal jobs. To provide meaningful employment to millions entering the workforce each year, India must ramp up its manufacturing exports, as relying solely on services won't address the needs of the unskilled labour force,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "One concern is that reducing tariffs could lead to dumping, where foreign companies flood the market with cheap goods, potentially harming domestic industries.",
      "According to Ms Sengupta, India's ideal approach to trade would involve a \"universal reduction\" in import tariffs, as it currently has some of the highest tariffs among its trading partners.",
      "However, there is a caveat: China's trade struggles, particularly with the US due to the ongoing trade war, could lead to Chinese dumping in India in the \"short run\".",
      "\"To protect against this, India can use non-tariff barriers against China but only against this one country and only in cases of proven dumping. Barring that, it is in India's interest to do a wholesale slashing of tariffs,\" she says.",
      "There's also a growing concern that India may be overcompensating in its efforts to flatter the US.",
      "Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), believes that India's tendency to soften trade policies \"based on rhetoric rather than economic pressure\" shows a lack of assertiveness in global trade talks.",
      "If this trend continues, he says, India may end up making even more compromises in its trade deal with the US, further \"eroding its bargaining power\".",
      "\"In comparison to other major economies, India's pre-emptive surrender on multiple trade fronts - without the US imposing a single country-specific tariff - makes it appear exceptionally vulnerable to pressure tactics.\"",
      "The broader consensus seems to be that India should capitalise on what could be the unintended consequences of Trump's tariff wars. Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, believes that \"potential US tariffs may have become a catalyst for reforms.\".",
      "\"If supply chains are rejigged again during the second Trump presidency due to higher tariffs on large exporters, and the world looks for new producers, India may get a second chance,\" she writes.",
      "Creating jobs that manufacture goods for the world won't be easy. India has largely missed the bus on low-end, unskilled factory work - jobs China dominated for decades. Automation is taking over. Without deeper reforms, India risks being left behind.",

      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in this month. Now he will fight to stay in the job after calling a snap general election which will see Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.",
      "Carney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.",
      "Unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March.",

      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",

      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.",
      "Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

    "story": [
      "Teachers unable to get divorced because of delays getting their pensions valued are taking legal action against the government.",
      "Hundreds of teachers have been frustrated by long delays that left them \"in limbo\", unable to move on with their lives or plan for their future.",
      "Construction skills lecturer David Quinton, from Gloucestershire, said the legal action was not just about financial compensation but making the government \"realise that they have affected people's mental well being\".",
      "The government, which issued an apology in December, has told the BBC there are now 620 people - including recent applicants - waiting for valuations, down from 3,062 in October 2024.",
      "\"I know a statement has been issued with an apology, but I don't think that apology is worth anything truthfully. It's a bit too little, too late,\" Mr Quinton said.",
      "In December, Teachers' Pensions - which runs the scheme on behalf of the Department for Education - said it aimed to clear most of the backlog by the end of February, with the government describing the calculations as \"extremely complex\".",
      "The value of a pension is needed by the courts to decide whether it should be shared with an ex-partner, and without which it is almost impossible to reach a financial settlement.",
      "A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is usually provided within three months of  a request being submitted but some teachers have been waiting much longer.",
      "Mr Quinton applied for a CETV in October 2023 as part of divorce proceedings and got it on 29 January this year, 15 months after applying.",
      "Although he has now received his valuation, he said there is \"still a long way to go\" to finalise his divorce.",
      "'Made accountable'",
      "He now wants to join a group action being brought by the teaching union NASUWT and legal firm Leigh Day against the pension provider and the Department for Education.",
      "\"I think it's important that the government need to realise that they have affected people's mental well being. They have affected them financially. And there has to be an impact on them for not doing that,\" he said.",
      "\"It's important that those thousands of people [affected] have a voice and the way that we have a voice is by joining this action.\"",
      "Mr Quinton estimates that the \"elongated\" process of getting the CETV has now cost him upward of \u00a38,000 in solicitors' bills.",
      "Wendy Dopheide, 60, is an English and drama teacher from Warminster, Wiltshire, and said she would also consider legal action.",
      "\"I can't overstate just how stressful this is for people like me in this situation,\" she said.",
      "\"By the age of 60, which I am now, many people are starting to look forward to retirement. I can't do that because I have no idea about what my financial situation will be when I do retire and whether I'll be able to afford to live.\"",
      "She originally applied for her CETV in August 2023 but is still waiting. She said the December update claiming that the backlog would be cleared by the end of February made her \"hopeful\", but that since then she has been met with a \"stony silence\".",
      "\"When I heard about it, I thought 'wow, I can start to move on and get the information that I need',\" she said.",
      "\"And I heard nothing back, nothing at all.\"",
      "A similar feeling of being left in the dark is shared by Philip Hawkins, a 57-year-old retired art teacher, from Exeter.",
      "He first contacted Teachers' Pensions about a CETV in October last year.",
      "He was told he would have to pay for the valuation and that he would be sent an invoice. It took five months for that invoice to arrive.",
      "\"Each time I was calling up, I was told I would get a response within a certain number of days, 10 days, and never would get that response,\" he said.",
      "\"When I'd phone up again, I would say 'what's happened to my previous request?' I would get the same answer, that this is being escalated and we'll get back to you and each time no one ever gets back to me.",
      "\"I've felt like throwing my phone out the window and knocking my head against the wooden table because I felt there's nothing I can do here.\"",
      "He received and paid an invoice for the CETV earlier this month, but said that he is \"very anxious\" that he could be waiting another year or two for the valuation.",
      "\"It's very tiring and it's something that wears away at you.\"",
      "Ryan Bradshaw, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, is leading the lawsuit.",
      "\"There's a clear statutory obligation within the legislation that states that Teachers' Pensions must provide CETV calculations within three months of any request,\" Mr Bradshaw said.",
      "\"We've got people who've been waiting in excess of 12 months for a calculation.",
      "\"They've been let down by the pension scheme administrators. They've been let down by the Department for Education... and then they're let down by the regulators and the (Pensions) Ombudsman, who've allowed this situation to persist for so long.\"",
      "Complex calculations",
      "In an update to its members last week, Teachers' Pensions again apologised for the ongoing delays.",
      "It had previously explained that a judgement, known as the McCloud pension remedy, resulted in the government making changes to public service pension schemes, and calculating valuations in a new way.",
      "Teachers' Pensions said that it had been waiting on guidance to be produced and that preparing that took \"a long time to agree for consistency [across all public service pension schemes] and to ensure calculations don't need to be revisited\".",
      "In December, the Department for Education said the delays were not a result of having too few staff.",
      "Teachers' Pensions has now confirmed that 80% of that backlog has been cleared, and that it is looking at other options to provide the remaining applicants with their valuations in lieu of a CETV.",
      "'Wider impact'",
      "Capita, who is the current administrator of the Teachers' Pensions scheme, said the delays have been outside of its control and it is \"continuing to work closely with the Department for Education to complete the remaining cases\".",
      "Meanwhile Mr Bradshaw recommends that any teachers affected by the delays pay attention to the outcome of the case.",
      "\"The main thing is that this is being brought as a collective action and.... the changes that arise as a result of any legal action can have a wider impact than just the group of those people that we're representing.\"",
      "He urged people to speak to their own union representatives and keep up pressure on Teachers' Pensions and the Secretary of State for Education.",
      "\"It's just a case of creating pressure from every single angle. It's not just about bringing legal action, it's also about bringing to bear some form of political pressure as well to try and get a resolution to the wider issues.\"",

      "However, some nurseries and childminders say they may have to drop out of the scheme as government funding struggles to meet rising costs, including National Insurance increases from April.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson says the survey highlights \"the real difference the expanded childcare entitlements are making\".",
      "In England, the government has been rolling out a scheme to help working parents with the high annual cost of childcare, which peaked at more than \u00a315,000 last year.",
      "However, currently parents of children under three years old can access 15 hours a week of childcare paid for by the government.",

      "Ms Kenyon says, on one hand, the government is telling parents they can expect cheaper bills, but she believes they are not paying enough to nurseries to provide them.",
      "Last month, the Department for Education (Dfe) sent a letter to nurseries saying parents should be able to opt out of paying for chargeable extras including lunches, \"to ensure no family is priced out\".",

      "\"The government has decided to impose stricter rules on us, and I think some nurseries are just saying, 'We can't do it - if we want to keep our businesses and our staff employed we're going to have to pull out'.\"",

      "So what's more intimidating - playing to a small room of punks, or an arena with thousands of people?",
      "\"The more the merrier,\" he replies. \"If you're selling tickets for a living, the more the merrier.\"",

      "However, Clarke's stream of consciousness dried up as he fell into heroin addiction in the 80s. He says he almost died as a result, and was fortunate to make it through those years.",
      "\"Well, I died four times. I came back but medical action was called for. I'm the luckiest guy alive. Somebody up there likes me.\"",

      "Turner turned him into Britain's most listened-to poet by using his words in the Arctic Monkeys' 2013 song I Wanna Be Yours.",
      "The original I Wanna Be Yours is a rare example in Clarke's catalogue of an unabashed love poem, albeit an unconventional one. \"I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust / I wanna be your Ford Cortina, I will never rust,\" it begins.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 02:06:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Funding problems meant Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light was almost axed weeks before filming began.",
    "story": [
      "The director of acclaimed period drama Wolf Hall says filming of last year's second series was nearly called off weeks before it was due to begin because of budget pressures.",
      "Peter Kosminsky told BBC Two's Newsnight they eventually opted to axe costly exterior scenes in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light, meaning almost everything in the Tudor drama, screened by the BBC, became \"conversations in rooms\" instead.",
      "He argues public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV can no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "The Bafta and Golden Globe-winning director is calling for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund.",
      "Kosminsky told the BBC that six weeks before shooting began, having already cut certain props, locations, costumes and cast members, he and the producer decided the gap was still \"too great\" to go ahead with making The Mirror and The Light.",
      "\"That's not something that has ever happened to me before, in all the years I've been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.\"",
      "Kosminsky has previously revealed that he - alongside Sir Mark Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell,  executive producer Colin Callender and Oscar-winning writer Peter Straughan - took significant pay cuts to get the programme over the line.",
      "He said the original script \"had many scenes set outside, many scenes involving horses, we had a whole joust, an extraordinary scene as conceived by Hilary Mantel, the original novelist \u2013 and we had to cut everything\".",
      "He said he was still \"incredibly proud of what we've achieved, and the response overwhelmed us all\".",
      "But the original concept was a programme with \"more fresh air in it, where you got more of a sense of Tudor society out in the world, and the lives these people lived when they weren't in the throne rooms, palaces and beautiful dining rooms\".",
      "Kosminsky said things had got worse since he filmed the drama, which was broadcast in November.",
      "Now, he argues, public service broadcasters would not be able to afford to commission Wolf Hall or Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the landmark ITV drama about the Post Office scandal.",
      "One day in the not too distant future, he warns, British audiences will notice these types of programmes are \"gone\".",
      "Kosminsky also believes there is \"no way\" the BBC or ITV could afford to make Adolescence, the current hit show from Netflix about a teenager accused of murder.",
      "Adolescence writer Jack Thorne thinks traditional broadcasters could have made the drama, but they would have had to cut some of the most expensive scenes.",
      "\"It would have been a slightly different version of it,\" Thorne told the BBC.",
      "\"In episode two, I wrote a fire drill that involved 300 extras. Those 300 extras had to be employed for 10 days. That is an awful lot of money. So all these things would have been difficult on a public service budget.",
      "\"I think we could have done it, it just would have been very different. And truthfully, it probably would have needed co-finance from abroad, and the problem at the moment is that finance has disappeared.\"",
      "The impact of Covid and the 2023 US actors' and writers' strikes, as well as higher energy costs, are some of the reasons often given for the increasing costs of TV production.",
      "And Kosminsky is not alone in arguing that the advent of streaming platforms has inflated prices so dramatically that the public service broadcasters have been unable to keep up.",
      "Patrick Spence, the executive producer behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, told the BBC this was \"a serious issue\".",
      "\"Not only would Mr Bates not get funded today, but I wouldn't even have started developing it,\" he said.",
      "Former subpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, whose story was central to the programme named after him, said it would be \"a real shame\" if these kinds of dramas could no longer be made.",
      "Mr Bates vs the Post Office meant \"a lot of people saw for the first time the sort of hell going on in the background in the Post Office, the real miscarriage of justice going on right across the country\", he said.",
      "Spence said the price of making dramas had risen at the same time as the international funding model had dried up for these types of shows. Later this year, his ITV drama The Hack, about the phone hacking scandal, by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne, will air in the UK.",
      "Spence said there was \"no way\" he could raise the money to fund that programme now.",
      "Streaming levy",
      "Figures out last month from the BFI showed \u00a35.6bn was spent on high end TV and film production in the UK in 2024. But domestic UK programmes accounted for \u00a3598m, down 22% on the previous year.",
      "Kosminsky argues that a levy on the streamers would put the UK in line with some other European countries that use the proceeds to fund domestic content, such as France and Denmark.",
      "But with many streamers based in the US, would the UK government take on Donald Trump's administration?",
      "In February, a White House memorandum referenced levies on US streaming services, calling them \"one-sided, anti-competitive policies\" that \"violate American sovereignty\".",
      "On Thursday, as she accepted an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild, Jayne Featherstone, executive producer of Netflix's Black Doves, said the UK was \"at risk of losing the very stories that define us\".",
      "\"We are in the 45th minute of the pilot episode, and we've got five minutes left to stop the bomb from going off,\" she said.",
      "She recently told a House of Commons committee she would like to see an uplift in tax relief for high end television, similar to the one already given to the film sector.",

    "summary": "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 could the lasting impact of the pandemic play a part?",
    "story": [
      "In an old gun barrel factory in Sheffield's industrial heartland, hundreds of people are raving under the fluorescent lights of Hope Works club for one of the last times before it closes. One young woman has dressed all in black to signify the loss of her \"favourite place\".",
      "\"This is a landmark of Sheffield,\" says one reveller. \"It's the reason a lot of people come to university here,\" adds another.",
      "Its owner Liam O'Shea believes that nightlife venues like this are \"the vital underbelly of everything\".",
      "\"It's where people find themselves,\" he says. \"It's where people find their tribe.\"",
      "Mr O'Shea, who calls himself a child of the \"rave generation\", started Hope Works because he wanted to tap into that original spirit. Only now, Hope Works has gone. It closed its doors permanently in February after 13 years.",
      "And according to Mr O'Shea, grassroots clubs in the UK - places where up and coming artists often perform live - are \"dropping like flies\".",
      "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 more than a third of the total number.",
      "In London, a dedicated taskforce is being launched by the mayor's office to help boost nightlife and save venues at risk of closing.",
      "\"A complex matrix of factors are all conspiring against and placing pressure on the sector, making for a perfect storm for nightclubs,\" says Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and programme leader at the University of Lancashire.",
      "There are many factors that could be at play - among them, rising costs, less disposable income and changing lifestyle choices.",
      "But the closures prompt broader questions too. Some experts have suggested, for example, that the lasting impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns may have led to people going out less than they once did",
      "And if that is the case, could the closure of so many clubs nod to a wider cultural shift, particularly among Generation Z?",
      "Did the pandemic change a generation?",
      "For several years during the pandemic, young people were unable to experience nightlife in the same way previous generations had, so perhaps it is not surprising that there have since been shifts in the way they socialise.",
      "A recent Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) study of more than 2,000 people aged between 18 and 30 found that nearly two thirds were going out less frequently than the year before.",
      "Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Feigin of Dr Elizabeth Consultancy says Gen Z is being driven by a number of factors \u2013 both offline and online. Part of this seems to be a rising consciousness around health, both physical and mental - and \"we are seeing less of a drinking culture\".",
      "A YouGov survey of 18 to 24-year-olds shows Gen Z continue to be the most sober group overall, with 39% of them not drinking alcohol at all.",
      "Dr Meg Jay, author of The Defining Decade, suggests there are several factors driving this change. \"Although some might imagine that young people are going out less post-Covid because depressed Gen Zers are still sitting around in their rooms, I don't think this is the case.\"",
      "There is more awareness about the dangers of substances as well as messaging on social media around healthy lifestyles, she says.",
      "Socialising less - or just differently?",
      "When lockdown restrictions were in place, Dr Jay recalls some young clients saying they'd have to find new ways to have a good time. \"[I had] clients telling me how much happier they were as they spent less time feeling drunk, hungover, or broke and more time feeling in charge of their lives.\"",
      "Of course social media is also playing a role in how people socialise. For some, \"social media and texting with friends scratches some of the itch of meeting up\".",
      "This rings true with Mr Rigg. \"We have a massive dependence on social media that has taken us away from more social pastimes,\" he argues.",
      "But Dr Feigin believes that the lag in social communication across the younger generations predates the lockdowns. \"I think it's been exacerbated by the pandemic. But I think it was already declining on the back of social media and technology and also helicopter parents.\"",
      "There might be some healthy reasons for the decline in night life, she points out - but she also thinks that there's \"some damage as well\".",
      "\"[This is] potentially around mental health, of social anxiety, loneliness and people actually not having the skills \u2013 not even bravery \u2013 to go out and socialise anymore because so much has become dependent online.\"",
      "\"It's getting harder and harder for young people to socialise face to face... I do think that we are seeing higher rates of social anxiety and high rates of loneliness\".",
      "A 'storm' coming for clubs?",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this is the reason for the club closures. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, thinks that finances play a big role. \"The reality is, is people can't afford it\".",
      "Entry fees vary depending on the club. Early release tickets in some city centres can be around \u00a310, while on-the-door entry or last-minute tickets will likely be more. Then comes the cost of any drinks, taxis, late-night trips to the kebab shop.",
      "In an NTIA study, 68% of people reported that the current economic climate had reduced how much they go out.",
      "\"Clubbing is becoming a luxury, and that's just crazy,\" says Sherelle Thomas, DJ on BBC 6 Music. \"You should be able to enter a club and be with friends at any time you want because it's something that makes you happy.\"",
      "Mr Rigg suggests there is a \"storm\" coming for clubs, as a result of new economic challenges such as national insurance hikes.",
      "If clubs cannot absorb economic challenges and so put prices up, this could make them less affordable and a less attractive proposition still, argues Mr Rigg - particularly at a time when consumers are burdened with rising living costs.",
      "In 2024, the company which owned Pryzm and Atik, two well-known nightlife chains, went into administration. It closed 17 and sold 11 venues (which included clubs and bars), citing changing student habits as the reason for closures.",
      "Russell Quelch, CEO of Neos, which runs the remaining venues, believes students have less money than they used to. \"People really care about how they spend their money,\" he argues. \"Gone are the days of students going out four or five nights a week\".",
      "The company now has several \"party bars\" which are open in the day too, meaning the trading window is longer. Many are themed, with events such as bingo, and they are not as alcohol orientated.",
      "The places bucking the trend",
      "The Acapulco in Halifax has seen thousands of people on its dancefloor since it opened in 1961. It is thought to be the UK's oldest nightclub. Its bar is lit in red and blue, and the beat of the music ebbs through its doors as people spill in to dance, often several nights in a row.",
      "But its owner Simon Jackson has noticed some shifts in the way people go clubbing. Some will come before the night properly begins and film themselves dancing for TikTok, he explains.",
      "The Acca, as it is known locally, is defying its environment. In Yorkshire, 40 percent of clubs have shut down since 2020 - the most out of any region in Britain. Mr Jackson attributes the club's longevity - in a challenging market - to, among other things, \"value for money\".",
      "There are also other models of clubbing that are seeing some success.",
      "Gut Level, a queer-led community project in Sheffield that runs inclusive club nights, is built on a membership model with reduced prices for those on low incomes.",
      "Co-founder Katie Matthews says: \"The music scene was run a lot by guys and it maybe didn't think about the safety of people like women and queer people as much.\"",
      "Then there is the safety aspect. In 2023, more incidents of drink spiking occurred in bars (41%) and clubs (28%) than anywhere else, and many people say they have experienced sexual violence during a night out.",
      "\"It's about safety of members,\" says Katie Matthews - at Gut Level, people have to sign up in advance.",
      "Ultimately, though, many clubs that continue to thrive do so because they are built around a sense of community. DJ Ahad Elley (known as Ahadadream), who moved to the UK from Pakistan at the age of 12, believes that this is a valuable aspect of many clubs.",
      "\"For some people it's almost the only place they've got where they can go and feel a sense of belonging and real community,\" he says.",
      "Why preserving clubs matters",
      "Cat Rossi has spent years researching the creative significance of nightclubs, in her capacity as a design historian and professor of architecture at University for the Creative Arts Canterbury. \"Since the dawn of civilisation we've needed to go out and dance and be together at night,\" she says. \"Social gathering is a core part of our social fabric.",
      "\"I think that nightclubs are really undervalued as these hugely creative forms of architecture and design, but also nightclubs and club culture more generally are these huge engines of creativity.\"",
      "Many fashion labels have been born in clubs, she points out, making them part of a \"bigger creative ecosystem\" along with theatres, opera houses and television studios.",
      "In 2016, a German court officially designated Berghain, a famous Berlin nightclub, as a cultural institution, which gave it the same tax status as the city's opera houses and theatres.",
      "The following year, Zurich recognised techno culture as part of its \"intangible cultural heritage\" in partnership with Unesco.",
      "It is a sentiment is shared by some in Britain too. As Mr Kill puts it: \"They are a British institution. There's no two ways about it.\"",
      "And the key to preserving this, and ensuring the future of nightclubs, is evolution, argues Mr Rigg.",
      "\"Nightclubs do need to evolve to maintain relevance due to the cultural behavioural shifts and also modify the business model to mitigate some of the other economic pressures.\"",
      "But without that transformation, the UK risks losing more of them.",

    "story": [
      "One of the most talked-about TV shows of recent years, Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, has been the hot topic of discussion this week, from the House of Commons to US talk shows to the gates of the scriptwriter's son's school.",
      "Those discussions have been sparked by the fictional story of a 13-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing a girl, and the factors that could have turned him into a killer.",
      "\"I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,\" writer Jack Thorne says. \"That's really gratifying.",
      "\"My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do',\" Thorne adds.",
      "\"The conversations seem to be starting in all sorts of different places.\"",
      "Thorne is now calling for the government to take \"radical action\" to help tackle the issues the programme raises.",
      "Chief among them are social media and the influence of incel (involuntary celibate) ideas, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities.",
      "But the drama, which Thorne created with actor Stephen Graham, is not just pointing the finger at incel culture, the writer tells the BBC.",
      "\"I really hope this is a drama that suggests that Jamie is like this because of a whole number of complicated factors.\"",
      "His parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways.",
      "But Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence.",
      "\"He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it. He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,\" Thorne says.",
      "\"At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.\"",
      "The writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes.",
      "He found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places.",
      "\"It was far from just Andrew Tate. It was not those big guns of the manosphere,\" he says.",
      "\"It was the smaller blogs and vlogs and the little bits like people talking about a video game, but then explaining through that video game why women hate you.",
      "\"That was the stuff that I found most disturbing.\"",
      "These issues aren't new, but the show has come as others are also discussing the dangerous messages aimed at boys and young men.",
      "On Wednesday, former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivered a speech warning against \"callous, manipulative and toxic influencers\".",
      "\"They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives,\" he said.",
      "Thorne says Sir Gareth is \"amazing\" - but he believes the solution is about more than having better role models.",
      "\"We've been having that conversation since I was a kid,\" the writer says. \"This has got to be a point where we do something a bit more radical than that. It's not about role models.",
      "\"Role models obviously can have a huge impact on people. But truthfully, we've got to change the culture that they're consuming and the means by which our technology is facilitating this culture.",
      "\"It was a really interesting speech, but I was hoping he was going to propose more radical things than he did.\"",
      "So what could more radical solutions be?",
      "This week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he's been watching the \"very good\" drama with his teenage children.",
      "Violence carried out by young men who are influenced by what they see online is  \"abhorrent and we have to tackle it\", and is \"also a matter of culture\", he told the Commons.",
      "Thorne hopes the PM will get the message that \"there's a crisis happening in our schools, and we need to think about how to stop boys from harming girls, and each other\".",
      "\"That's going to take a mass of different things to facilitate in schools and in homes, and that requires government help,\" he says.",
      "He urges Sir Keir to \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.",
      "The writer has also suggested extending that to all smartphone use and gaming.",
      "\"I think we should be doing what Australia is doing, and separating our children from this pernicious disease of thought that is infecting them,\" he says.",
      "A ban would be a tough sell to teenagers, though.",
      "Thorne appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight this week alongside three men aged 18, 19 and 21.",
      "When asked about a social media ban for under-16s, they had mixed feelings.",

    "story": [
      "When Peter Mullan steps on stage as legendary football manager Bill Shankly on Friday night, it will be for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Red or Dead is an adaptation of the 2013 David Peace novel of the same name, a fictionalised account of Shankly's glory years with Liverpool Football Club, and the period post-retirement when he lived in the shadow of his own success.",
      "There's a statue to Shankly outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium, and a city full of fans who know his name is part of their history - but that's not what's worrying Peter Mullan.",
      "\"There's 52 of us on stage,\" he says.",
      "\"It's not all about Shankly, it's about the city of Liverpool and the people.",
      "\"The biggest pressure is that the play is faithful to the spirit of the book. It's an intelligent, unashamedly exploration of football. It's much closer to Brecht or Shakespeare than the usual football biographies.\"",
      "Philip Breen, who is responsible for the adaptation, first approached Mullan a number of years ago about an eight-hour passion play he envisaged with a community chorus.",
      "The pandemic intervened and put his plans on hold, but a chance meeting with David Peace in his adopted city of Tokyo encouraged Breen to focus on the book.",
      "The community chorus was revived and Les Dennis, Gordon Kennedy, Allison McKenzie, George Jones and Keith Fleming were cast. But despite being a huge football fan, and a former youth player, Peter Mullan was unconvinced.",
      "\"It was a project I really wanted to do but trying to find the time to afford to be able to do it was hard. Financially, how anyone survives in theatre is beyond me.\"",
      "The wages in subsidised theatre weren't the only difference. In film and TV he says he would learn lines day by day, whereas this required committing the whole script to memory, and developing Shankly's distinctive voice.",
      "\" Vocally, we're similar,\" he says.",
      "\"We have that same timbre but I've had to work on the way he speaks.\"",
      "That involved watching countless videos and recordings of Shankly, one of the first football managers to understand the power of the media, and use it to his advantage.",
      "At 65, Mullan is older than Shankly was when he retired from football, a key moment in the play.",
      "\"I'm probably about five or six years too old for the part but in theatre there's more license. I think in a TV or film version, I think they might cast someone else because I don't look like him, but I sound like him.\"",
      "Born in Peterhead and raised in the Mosspark area of Glasgow, close to the Govan shipyards, Mullan enjoyed football as a teenager. A goalkeeper and then a midfielder, he tried out for Manchester United where he learned the life lesson that he was \"good but not good enough\".",
      "He left football behind to study at the University of Glasgow.",
      "He appeared in a number of stage shows including The Trick is to Keep Breathing at the Tron Theatre in 1995 which was to be the last live theatre performance he would give.",
      "After that came roles in Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. He was the toast of European film festivals like Venice and Cannes, where he won accolades as a director and an actor.",
      "He's one of the most recognisable faces on television, playing gritty hard men in Top of the Lake, and The Fixer, a shy romantic lead in the BBC sitcom Mum and a dwarf king in Amazon Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.",
      "More recently he's been seen in Ozark, The North Water and After the Party.",
      "Which explains why, despite the low wages, he's enjoying a break from the industry.",
      "\"You're completely infantilised in film and TV. You don't make your way to work in the morning, you get a note saying someone will pick you up. Then you go to work and you're taken to a caravan and they ask what you want for breakfast and then they bring you a cup of tea.",
      "\"Then you go to makeup and costume and then you're escorted onto a set and then you do your acting and then it all happens in reverse.\"",
      "He seems happy to make his own tea, strolling into the rehearsal rooms and getting down to work with the rest of the cast, many of whom are also veterans of the screen (Allison McKenzie who plays his wife Ness was a regular in River City, and had a key role in Line of Duty).",
      "\"After 30 years, I've genuinely forgotten how long you get to rehearse, and how long the working day is. I keep asking the young team, is this normal?\"",
      "Normal, hard-working and humorous are all traits he shares with Shankly who transformed Liverpool from a second division club into a winning team.",
      "Which takes us back to the book, Red or Dead, a dense and detailed novel as much about fanaticism as football.",
      "\"It doesn't demand that you know football. It demands your understanding that he is a fanatic and in order to understand him, you have to understand what he's fanatical about, and in understanding that you understand the world that he was in.\"",
      "It's a world which no longer exists, and only one of those original passionate working-class player managers is still alive.",
      "\"Bill Shankly, Matt Busby, and Jock Stein \u2013 those three kings of football - they paid a price for that. One doesn't want to romanticise it too much.  Is it admirable, is it healthy, is it fanaticism?",
      "\"There's Alex Ferguson, who has lived to a ripe old age, but he's in the same camp. The last of those committed, nothing-else-but-football managers. They live and breathe it.\"",
      "He says he's delighted to be performing at the Royal Court, where audiences can tuck into a bowl of scouse in the auditorium before many of the shows. He says he's been told it compares with the Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow.",
      "\"They let you know if they're getting bored. It's not bourgeois polite and that appeals to me.\"",
      "And he hopes it will appeal to fans of all football teams, and none.",
      "\"That's going to be the big test. My kids have a passing acquaintance. My boy is into football but my girls are not massively into it so it will be fascinating to see how they relate to it.\"",
      "And given his views on the low wages of subsidised theatre, and the fact that his family are coming to Liverpool to see the show, can we assume he won't be treading the boards again soon?",
      "\"No, it's a one-off for me. I can't afford it. The show might tour but with a 52-strong cast, I'm not sure if anyone can afford it.\"",

      "Born in Puducherry, India, to French parents, Kalki describes herself as a \"geeky introvert\" while growing up. As a teenager, she says, she was uncomfortable with her appearance, and pursuing a career on camera only intensified those feelings.",

      "\"But I know that 20-year-olds are being told this and they feel the pressure to go and change their face very early on.\"",

      "One day after school you told me, \"Maman I'm not pretty.\" You were only four. I panicked and immediately responded with, \"What do you mean, of course you're pretty, you're as pretty as a butterfly, as bright as the sun.'' And you continued to say angrily, \"I'm not, I'm just not.\"",
      "In retrospect, I wish I had listened to you and been curious enough to ask you why you didn't feel pretty? You see I make mistakes too, my own insecurities and need to protect you took over and I didn't allow you the space to feel what you were feeling. Don't let others decide who you are. Not even me. You have far more experience at being you than anyone else. And no-one else can be a better you than you.",
      "Thankfully, I get second chances at being a better mother, and when a few weeks later you said \"I don't like myself\", I stopped my impulse to tell you what you were and listened. There was some silence and then you opened up about how you were having a hard time with some other children in school.",
      "I thought about how to ensure you know that beauty is not skin deep. The truth is sometimes you will feel ugly. I feel ugly sometimes even though I'm constantly told by the world around me that I'm beautiful. And so now I have made it a point to tell you how beautiful you are, not when you're feeling bad about the way you look, and not when you're dressed your best, but when you are being the best versions of you.",
      "As you grow older I know that you will not always believe that you're beautiful because we live in a social world that has distorted beauty, that has tricked us into thinking beauty is a certain size, a certain colour, or a certain shape. These beauty standards will change throughout your lifetime, so do not hold too much value to what society deems beautiful currently.",
      "Remember that you are whole and that if you start to pick apart your little nose or your hairy brows or your not quite right ears, you will start to feel ugly, but that is only because you are forgetting the whole. An elephant is a beautiful animal, but pick it apart and it's got a long wrinkly nose, strange side glancing eyes, huge sticking out ears and a big fat stomach.",
      "Remember that your scars, your wrinkles, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet, your hair, your skin are all here as witnesses to your beautiful life, they are here to grow old with you, and carry you through the ups and downs, they are your friends for life.",

    "story": [
      "British film critics have mostly panned Disney's live-action remake of Snow White, while US reviewers have been somewhat more positive.",
      "Chief film critic for The Times, Kevin Maher, said: \"Believe the anti-hype, it's that bad\", although Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film \"mostly captivating\".",
      "Its release has faced several issues throughout its production, from alleged disagreements between cast members, to debates over representation of the seven dwarfs, and the casting of Rachel Zegler in the lead role.",
      "Reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film, which will be released globally on Friday, an initial critics' score of just 47%.",
      "The mostly good",
      "US reviewer Rooney describes director Marc Webb's work a \"vibrant retelling\" with a \"smart script\" from Erin Cressida Wilson.",
      "But he isn't a fan of the way the film handles the seven dwarfs.",
      "The debate around the dwarves began in 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, who has has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney used computer-generated characters in the remake to \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\", but some other actors with dwarfism were concerned this decision would prevent them from getting work in the future.",
      "Rooney said: \"Although the talented voice cast gives the characters humour and distinctive personalities, their CGI renderings are a bit creepy, and less photorealistic than many of the cute woodland creatures that flock around Snow White.\"",
      "Pete Hammond wrote in Deadline that the film is \"just fine\", adding: \"It manages to make a thoroughly decent reboot from a genuine, never-out-of-circulation classic and make it fresh and relevant again for contemporary audiences.\"",
      "He added the musical film has \"dazzling dance numbers\" while the title character of Snow White \"is played to perfection by Rachel Zegler\".",
      "Variety's Owen Gleiberman called the film \"one of the better live-action adaptations of a Disney animated feature\".",
      "He felt that the CGI dwarfs \"bring the movie to life\", adding they have \"catchy personalities and comically expressive mottled-clay faces\".",
      "Gleiberman concluded the film is \"lighter, more frolicsome, less lead-footed than such clomping live-action Disney remakes as Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast\".",
      "Robbie Collin from The Telegraph gave the film a respectable three stars.",
      "\"Once Zegler scuttles off to the forest, where she teams up with two chirpy septets \u2013 the digitised dwarfs and a zany gaggle of bandits, who may have been dwarf replacements in an early draft \u2013 it really picks up,\" he said.",
      "He also described the performances of the songs Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work as \"stylishly choreographed and rousingly performed\".",
      "The not so good",
      "Most British publications haven't been so complimentary about the film, with the Daily Mail's Brian Viner giving the film two stars.",
      "\"Snow White the movie has its charms, and dozens of cute CGI forest animals, but on the whole it is a painfully muddle-headed affair,\" he says.",
      "He says Zegler \"has oodles of talent\" but \"Webb's film only intermittently allows her to sparkle\".",
      "Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, as a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\" prompted some controversy - it was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about the original animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022.",
      "\"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Her relationship with co-star Gal Gadot has also been under scrutiny, with rumours that promotional work for the film was scaled back because of their opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has used social media to post pro-Palestine material, whereas Israeli citizen Gadot served in her country's army for two years.",
      "However, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they presented an award together at the Academy Awards.",
      "Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film one star, calling it an \"exhaustingly awful reboot\".",
      "He describes the costume design for Snow White as a \"supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders\", adding: \"Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot (The Evil Queen) are forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives\".",
      "The Times's Maher referenced the pared-down European premiere for the film, which took place at a castle in northern Spain last week, while the Los Angeles launch was held on Saturday without most of the usual ranks of press on the red carpet.",
      "He added: \"The new tunes, much like Zegler's performance, are watery and ineffectual, while the dramatic jeopardy is non-existent.",
      "\"It's hard not to see this as anything other than a crisis point for Disney, a studio that used to make flawless cinematic stories but now infantilises global audiences with sanctimonious life lessons culled from the corpses of their own murdered movies\".",
      "Tickets for the film, which reportedly cost more than $270m (\u00a3217m) to make, have only been put on presale in the last two weeks, relatively late for a big Disney film.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent gave it one star, declaring that \"Rachel Zegler deserves better than the lazy, visually repellent Snow White\".",
      "\"What's most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney's choices have become. With Snow White, they've finessed their formula \u2013 do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices,\" she concluded.",

      "\"I have sat on the production line, I've made stuff, I've packed boxes, I've loaded lorries, I've delivered, I've collected money. Every single facet of business, I have done all of it.",
      "\"So when I got that Apprentice gig, sitting there listening to these budding entrepreneurs, I was able to interrogate them properly.\"",
      "Lord Sugar is arguably one of the UK's most famous rags-to-riches stories.",
      "After failing an aptitude test with tech company IBM as a young man in Hackney, east London, he started selling car aerials from a van, and later transistor radios.",
      "He launched his own electronics and technology company Amstrad in 1968, making home computers and satellite dishes for Sky, then through property investments and other ventures went on to become one of the country's richest men.",
      "'I'm nothing like Trump'",
      "Alan Sugar was approached by the BBC about making a UK version of a popular business-based entertainment show in the mid-noughties, towards the end of his challenging tenure as chair and owner of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.",
      "But why did he say yes?",
      "\"Because Donald Trump in America did The Apprentice first of all - and I have got a home in America, in Florida, and all the people were telling my wife, 'This is the greatest TV show ever',\" he explains.",
      "\"So I knew of it.\"",
      "He's reticent to talk about the now US president, saying \"there's no comparison\" between himself and the other former face of The Apprentice.",
      "\"He's nothing like me and I'm nothing like him,\" he says. \"But the point is that what he's doing is very, very unusual.\"",
      "Last month, Trump clashed with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a furious exchange at the White House. \"Unbelievable,\" says Lord Sugar.",
      "\"There are certain things in life that I didn't think I'd ever experience. One was Brexit, which is the biggest tragedy. [Then] you've got a leader of a country, of America, publicly having a slanging match with someone else. It's just not right.",
      "\"By all means have a slanging match behind closed doors, but not publicly.\"",
      "He describes the very public incident as \"humiliating for Zelensky\" while showing Trump's \"temper\".",
      "\"It's not statesmanlike, is it?\"",
      "He goes on: \"He may have done himself a favour amongst some of the Americans that backed him, but I don't think he did himself a favour [in front of the rest of the world], quite honestly.\"",
      "Asked how he would get the best out of Trump in negotations, he replies: \"The only way you can deal with him is to not disagree with him.",
      "\"End of.\"",
      "'I would beg to get back in EU'",
      "Always forthright with his opinions, Lord Sugar made recent headlines by airing his views on topics including working from home, telling workers to \"get their bums back to the office\".",
      "He's also shared his thoughts on female football commentators, Brexit and Boris Johnson, to name a few subjects.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords in 2018, Lord Sugar said Brexit campaigners, such as Tory politicians Johnson and Michael Gove, should be prosecuted for \"the \u00a3350m lie they put on the red bus\".",
      "\"Brexit was a total, absolute disaster,\" he tells Rajan. \"And anybody who says it's not is deluded.",
      "\"That has changed so many things.\"",
      "Despite calling for him to be jailed, a year later Lord Sugar backed Johnson as the next prime minister in order to \"stop [Jeremy] Corbyn getting into power\".",
      "He believes rejoining the EU is the answer to getting the UK growing again.",
      "\"I've never met [Prime Minister Sir Keir] Starmer, but if I ever did I would ask him, is it possible? What mechanism would it take to effectively get down on your bended knees and beg to be allowed back in again?",

      "He picks out one famous former contestant, Katie Hopkins, as someone who could have got the job had she not walked first.",
      "\"Remember her?\" asks Lord Sugar. \"Ratchet jaws, rent-a-mouth.\"",
      "Hopkins, nowadays a media personality and right-wing political commentator/provocateur, appeared on series three in 2007 but left the show despite being offered a place in the final because she could not commit to a potential move to London.",
      "\"I was about to say, 'Well, I'll hire you'. And she said, 'No, actually, I don't want to do it'. So she left,\" he remembers.",
      "\"She was good. She was the best of that crew. No question of it.\"",

    "summary": "With five massive stadium shows this summer, K-Pop is establishing itself in the UK mainstream.",
    "story": [
      "Six years ago, Amber Clare was a devoted One Direction fan.",
      "Scrolling through Twitter for information about the band's solo projects, she saw a reply that said \"Listen to Icy by Itzy\".",
      "Intrigued, she clicked on the link. It changed her life.",
      "\"I'd never listened to K-Pop before that point but I immediately became a fan,\" she says.",
      "\"And now Itzy is the reason I have my job.\"",
      "Today, Clare is the marketing and social media manager for K-Stars, the UK's first and biggest shop devoted to Korean pop music.",
      "Based in Manchester, it started as a small business in Manchester's Affleck's Palace in 2019.",
      "\"You'd order things by PayPal, and then the CEO would pack them up by himself and ship everything out,\" Clare recalls.",
      "Now it's a two-storey emporium, based on Deansgate, with a staff of more than 20 dedicated K-Pop enthusiasts.",
      "It's a sign of how the genre has exploded in the UK, even though radio and television has largely shunned all but the biggest acts, like BTS, aespa and Blackpink.",
      "\"It's still kind of a niche - but it's not a small niche,\" says Clare. \"In my head I'm the only Itzy fan, but when I went to see them in concert, it was sold out.",
      "\"I was like, 'Wow, where have all you people been hiding?'\"",
      "In fact, the UK is now among the top 10 countries that follow K-Pop on Spotify, with the boyband Ateez placing two records in the top five of the UK album charts last year.",
      "This summer, Blackpink will play two nights at Wembley Stadium, with Stray Kids pulling off the same feat in Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, Twickenham Stadium will say \"anyong haseyo\" to one of K-pop's longest-running festivals.",
      "Established in 2008, the SM Town Live festival is a showcase for artists signed to the SM Entertainment Label, one of the industry's key players.",
      "To celebrate the company\u2019s 30th anniversary, they're transplanting the event from Seoul to Middlesex.",
      "\"It's essentially a multi-day festival all in one, because you've got so many artists all at the same venue, jam packed into the space of three or four hours,\" says Reese Carter, of boyband Dear Alice, who'll be among the performers in Twickenham.",
      "\"It's non-stop. You've got to prep yourself, because you'll definitely want to dance.\"",
      "\"It's very down to earth but it goes straight to your heart,\" adds Ten from K-Pop group WayV.",
      "Targeting the UK",
      "SM holds a unique place in Korea's musical history. Founded in 1995 by Lee Soo-man, it is widely credited with establishing the K-Pop template.",
      "It was the first company to introduce the trainee system, where young talent goes through intensive training that lasts months, or even years, before making their \"debut\".",
      "And it dominated what's known as the \"first generation\" of K-Pop idols, with bands like H.O.T. and S.E.S.",
      "The Twickenham show will pay tribute to that three-decade journey, with a line-up that includes everyone from Red Velvet, EXO and Girl's Generation to current chart-toppers like aespa, Riize and all of the sub-units of boyband NCT - which boasts more than 20 members.",
      "\"That's very rare,\" says Ten, one of the group's most recognisable (and chatty) stars.",
      "\"The last time we had an NCT concert as a whole was two years ago. It's so difficult to schedule every group to be in the same spot at the same time.\"",
      "But that's not all. The concert will also feature what's been billed as \"a group of promising trainees\", known for now as SMTR25 \u2013 showcasing the future of the label.",
      "\"Performing alongside the senior artists we've admired since our trainee days, as well as our talented junior artists, makes this an incredibly meaningful experience for us,\" said aespa in an email to the BBC.",
      "The hope is that shows like this will open a few doors - because, for all the strides K-Pop has made in the last couple of years, bands have consistently prioritised America over Europe.",
      "It's a logical step. The US is the world's biggest music market, so it offers more opportunities for touring and merchandise sales, while an MTV Award performance or a concert for NPR's Tiny Desk series travels further internationally than an appearance at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The situation here isn't as good as what the American industry gets,\" acknowledges Amber Clare.",
      "\"Every single K-Pop group, if they announce a world tour, America will always be on the map - but European countries are always left wondering if they're going to be included or not.\"",
      "Things are changing, though.",
      "In a crowded market, labels are increasingly turning their attention to the UK \u2013 where the anglophone media has international reach, and there's a baked-in affection for boy and girl groups like Take That, Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Little Mix.",
      "To make inroads, bands have teamed up with some of Britain's biggest artists.",
      "Aespa's 2023 single Better Things was co-written by Raye, while Le Sserafim collaborated with PinkPantheress on club anthem Crazy and with Jungle on their latest song, Come Over.",
      "Last year, SM went one further \u2013 creating a British boyband and putting them through the K-Pop machinery.",
      "That group was Dear Alice, whose gruelling traineeship was documented in BBC series Made In Korea.",
      "Having survived the process, the five-piece finally premiered their debut single, Ariana, at a massive SM Town concert in Seoul in January.",
      "\"These shows are timed down to the second,\" says singer Blaise Noon. \"When we got our time to go on stage, it was literally like, 8:30 and 48 seconds. It just shows how so well thought out is.\"",
      "Bringing the production to London is evidence that SM has its sights trained on the UK, he confirms.",
      "\"In the UK, we produce some really amazing boy groups, so I think we have that connection in the culture. So I think they definitely want to hit it. I can see it getting bigger and bigger every day.\"",
      "Ten, who releases a new solo album, Stunner, next week, says he's already experienced the devotion of UK fans.",
      "When his group WayV last visited England in 2023, \"we were surprised that people could sing along to our songs, because we sing in Chinese\", he says.",
      "\"This opportunity with SM Town, I feel like it's going to open a bigger market for K-Pop in the UK.",
      "\"I hope so, because I'd like to come and perform my solo stuff to my UK fans too.\"",
      "The opportunity is there.",
      "Nine of the 10 best-selling albums in the world last year were by South Korean artists, illustrating the music's broad appeal - but none of those records charted in the UK\u2019s Top 50.",
      "Lack of radio exposure is one factor - but listeners can also be put off by clunky English lyrics or the sudden-but-deliberate stylistic shifts that characterise K-Pop.",
      "If you're willing to dig into the genre, though, you can find some of the most audacious and indelible hooks music has to offer.",
      "One by-product of K-pop\u2019s (relative) obscurity is the bond it creates among fans. There's a sense of belonging that comes from discovering and nurturing your \"bias\", outside the glare of the mainstream.",
      "It\u2019s a relationship bands foster by a fire hose stream of social media content, where dance challenges, video diaries and photoshoots are posted daily.",
      "Dear Alice experienced the impact of that effort at a UK meet-and-greet last weekend.",
      "\"It felt like we were hanging out with a bunch of our mates,\" says Dexter Greenwood.",
      "\"They were just cool people,\" adds James Sharp. \"We're starting to recognise faces and remember people on this journey - and I think there's going to be more and more.\"",
      "By the time they play Twickenham in June, the group promise to have more new music to showcase.",
      "In the meantime, though, they want to introduce their labelmates to some of the UK's finer customs.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 02:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "An inquest into the death of Ida Lock has shone light on repeat mistakes - and wider failures in certain hospitals across England",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Michael read this article",
      "By the entrance to Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness sits a sculpture of a moon with 11 stars. It is a memorial to the mother and babies who died unnecessarily due to poor care at the hospital between 2004 and 2013.",
      "Inscribed underneath is a short verse: \"Forever in our hearts; Forever held in the love that brought you here; Our star in the night sky, spring blossom, summer rose, falling leaf, winter frost; Forever in our hearts.\"",
      "When the memorial was unveiled in 2019, Aaron Cummins who is chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: \"We will never forget what happened.  We owe it to those who died to continually improve in everything that we do.\"",
      "Barely a month later, Sarah Robinson stepped into a birthing pool at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a hospital run by the same NHS trust. She was about to give birth to her second child.",
      "Within an hour, Ida Lock was born; within a week, she was dead.",
      "What her parents were put through on that day \u2013 and in the years since \u2013 goes a long way to explaining why maternity services in England have failed so many families.",
      "The inquest into Ida Lock's death, which concluded last week, exposed over five weeks why maternity services across England have long struggled to improve - and this one case holds a mirror to issues that appear to be prevalent across a number of trusts.",
      "'I thought I'd done something wrong'",
      "The memorial the trust erected at Furness General Hospital followed a damning inquiry into the trust's maternity services.",
      "That investigation, carried out by Dr Bill Kirkup and published in March 2015, found there had been a dysfunctional culture at Furness General, substandard clinical skills, poor risk assessments and a grossly deficient response to adverse incidents with a repeated failure to properly investigate cases and learn lessons.",
      "Morecambe Bay became a byword for poor maternity care and the trust promised to enact all 18 recommendations from the Kirkup review. And yet that never happened.",
      "\"We wouldn't be in this situation now if they'd followed those recommendations,\" says Ms Robinson.",
      "Ida Lock's inquest began last month, more than five years after she died - the delay was down to several reasons, including its particular complexity.",
      "What emerged was just how profoundly many of those lessons had not been learned. Particularly egregious, says Ms Robinson, was a suggestion from a midwife \u2013 shortly after the birth - that Ida's poor condition was linked to her smoking, something Sarah had never done in her life.",
      "\"The amount of days I cried because I thought I'd done something wrong... every Christmas, every holiday, you always have this heavy weight that you shouldn't be having fun. And all along, some people knew.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the staff who had delivered Ida were told in an email that \"they had demonstrated excellent teamwork, and had all worked in the best interests of mum and baby\".",
      "As the coroner found on Friday, Ida's death was wholly avoidable, caused by a failure to recognise that she was in distress prior to her birth, and then a botched resuscitation attempt after she was born.",
      "By the time she was transferred to a higher dependency unit, at the Royal Preston hospital, she had suffered a brain injury from which she could not recover.",
      "Having failed to deliver their daughter safely, Ida's parents would have expected that the trust would properly and openly investigate her death. Instead, they pursued an investigation that Carey Galbraith, the midwife who completed it, would later describe as \"not worth the paper it was written on\".",
      "They didn't take responsibility for their failings despite having an independent report from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) \u2013 a body that examined questionable maternity care \u2013 clearly stating their shortcomings.",
      "\"Our efforts to get any answers have been met with a complete block,\" said Ida's father, Ryan Lock. \"Particular people have told us to our face something that wasn't the case, that Ida was poorly before she was born, and that's the reason why that this happened.\"",
      "Clearly, the Morecambe Bay report was not, as was hoped, a line in the sand for maternity services across England, or a rallying cry for widespread improvements. As the inquest has shown, it did not even lead to sustained improvement at Morecambe Bay.",
      "Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer at the trust, said in a statement last week that it has made improvements since.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest. We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",
      "'A woeful picture' nationwide",
      "Elsewhere around the country, other trusts have also been forced to face their failures, often by grieving families.",
      "In March 2022, an investigation into services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust found that more than 200 mothers and babies could have survived with better care. Then, in October that year, a review into maternity services at East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust found that at least 45 babies might have survived if they had been given proper treatment.",
      "And an ongoing review into the maternity care provided by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust, due to be completed next year, is set to be the biggest yet, with around 2,500 cases being examined.",
      "Even that does not tell the full story. Families in several areas, including Sussex, Leeds and Oxford, want local investigations into their maternity services. And an annual review of units by inspectors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) paints a woeful picture.",
      "In the commission's latest report, published in September, not a single one of the 131 units inspected received the top rating, Outstanding, for providing safe care.",
      "About a third (35%) were rated as Good for safety, around half (47%) were rated as Requires Improvement while almost a fifth (18%) were deemed Inadequate, the lowest grading.",
      "\"While we identified pockets of excellent practice,\" wrote the CQC, \"we are concerned that too many women and babies are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve.\"",
      "Professor James Walker, who used to be the clinical director for HSIB, said that from his visits around England, the problem was that maternity units \"didn't have the skills, the finances, or the drive to actually make the changes that are required.\"",
      "Ida Lock's inquest was a case in point. What emerged over the inquiry was that the midwife delivering Ida was not compliant with crucial training in heart-rate monitoring, that staff did not know how to investigate incidents or realise they should inform external regulators of an unexpected death.",
      "\"It's deeply distressing,\" says Dr Kirkup. \"It's bad enough that other trusts didn't listen, but for it to happen again in this same trust is unforgivable.\"",
      "From poor culture to lack of teamwork",
      "Listening to his exasperation brought me back to the autumn of 2022. On that bright morning, Dr Kirkup was speaking at the publication of his inquiry into maternity care in East Kent.",
      "Many of the failures he'd found there \u2013 poor culture, lack of teamworking, not listening to families, a failure to investigate incidents or learn from them \u2013 were a repetition of what he'd uncovered at Morecambe Bay seven years earlier.",
      "He struggled to hide his frustration that here he was again, forced once more to explain to families why they had been failed by a trust that did not know how to do the right thing.",
      "Like Morecambe Bay, East Kent deteriorated even after his 2022 inquiry. Within months of the publication, inspectors became so concerned about its services that they considered closing maternity care at one of its hospitals, the William Harvey in Ashford.",
      "The CQC found that staff were not carrying out basic tasks such as washing their hands in between patients, or wearing gloves and aprons when delivering care, and that they were leaving urine and bloodstains in toilets.",
      "The inspection highlighted how little the East Kent review had changed things where it mattered, front-line in the wards.",
      "As the report had said, \"there are deep-seated and longstanding problems of organisational culture\" in the trust's maternity units, including \"disgraceful behaviour and flawed teamworking that were previously left to fester\".",
      "In October 2024, the board of East Kent Hospitals Trust said that it apologised unreservedly for the pain and loss, and for the failures of the board.",
      "It said: \"We are on a journey to fundamentally transform the way we work. Changing the culture of a large and complex organisation takes time and there is much work still to do, but we are determined to succeed so that we are providing the right standard of care and compassion.\"",
      "Derek Richford, whose grandson Harry had died in avoidable circumstances in 2017 at East Kent, is now working with the trust to improve maternity care and argues that it is an uphill struggle. \"It's been a devil of a job,\" he claims, \"to get people in the trust to simply read the report, even the summary.\"",
      "Should medics be punished?",
      "The question asked by some families is why heads haven't rolled. There is a widespread recognition in healthcare that punishing medics for individual clinical errors does not necessarily lead to safer outcomes.",
      "It can in some cases promote a defensive culture, where people do not own up to their mistakes and lead to individuals being blamed rather than supported to improve.",
      "The day after the Shrewsbury maternity report was published, the then-Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department would \"go after the people responsible.",
      "\"I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,\" he added.",
      "Three years later, there is no evidence of anybody being held to account.",
      "The Department of Health says it is \"unable to comment on individual staffing responsibility while an active police investigation is taking place\".",
      "\u00a31.15bn of maternity-related payouts",
      "Even when major reviews into maternity care have led to families getting individual feedback and told they had been failed, any subsequent legal action leads to NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, requiring that the case is examined afresh. This can add further delays and costs to the process.",
      "NHS Resolution said that inquiries \"do not look at cases from a legal liability perspective. Failings by a clinician might amount to errors of judgement, but that is not necessarily sufficient to constitute negligence under the law\".",
      "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "In 2023-24, NHS Resolution paid out \u00a31.15bn for maternity-related deaths and injuries, 41% of its total payments, despite maternity care forming a much smaller proportion of a trust's daily activities.",
      "\"NHS resolution is this anonymous body,\" says Derek Richford, \"that you can't get a name of the person you want to speak to. You can't get any accountability. And those people are the puppeteers for the people below who have to run around doing their will. It's wrong.\"",
      "'The time for inquiries is over'",
      "There are now calls for the government to establish a national maternity inquiry, rather than relying on individual ones at different hospitals and trusts. More than 36,000 people have signed up to one such petition, led by two sets of bereaved parents; while campaign group Maternity Safety Alliance is making a similar call. So far, the Department of Health hasn't committed to a national inquiry.",
      "Both Dr Kirkup and Prof Walker argue that the time for inquiries is over.",
      "\"Another inquiry will find exactly the same things that we find at the moment,\" said Prof Walker, \"we know what the problems are.\"",
      "What is needed is a national plan to improve maternity care, argues Dr Kirkup. He says he has been working with the Department of Health on drawing up plans to improve teamworking and providing compassionate care.",
      "Streeting has said he will \"fix our maternity services\", including supporting trusts to make rapid improvements and training more midwives, but has not detailed how he intends to go about this. \"I just wish that the Secretary of State would announce his intentions,\" says Dr Kirkup.",
      "Prof Walker also believes that a national programme of improvement and oversight should be launched, taking the learning from individual investigations and ensuring it is embedded across the system. For it to be truly effective, he argues, it will require a specific type of leadership.",
      "\"The NHS traditionally doesn't appoint leaders,\" he says, \"it appoints managers, people who come in and take the status quo that's there, and just make sure that it gets more efficient. That doesn't make it better, or innovate or improve.",
      "\"One of my frustrations over the years, working in various places, is I kept being told 'we don't do that'. And I kept on saying, 'why don't we do that?' The simple questions are always the best ones, because they challenge the status quo.\"",
      "Prof Walker highlights that there has been some progress in recent years, however. The latest figures on Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (the successor body to HSIB) show that the number of incidents of both potential and severe brain injuries have decreased.",
      "Back in East Kent, Mr Richford has observed some changes too. \"We have a new board of directors that appear to be doing the right thing \u2013 they're certainly saying the right thing,\" he says.",
      "\"[But] even now, seven years on [from Harry's death], it's still not as it should be. We are still trying to make sure that the trust is being as transparent as they say they are.\"",
      "As for Ida Lock's parents, the road on which their daughter would have grown up leads directly to Morecambe Bay, and a small patch of sand. This is where they scattered some of her ashes.

      "\"Nothing quite prepares you for the moment when you realise your baby is going to arrive early,\" the granddaughter of the late Queen Elizabeth II wrote in British Vogue on Sunday, adding, \"there's so little control.\"",

      "News of the princess's second pregnancy was announced by Buckingham Palace in October last year.",
      "However, routine scans soon revealed their \"precious cargo\" needed close monitoring, and Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi were told to prepare for an early arrival.",
      "\"What I learnt in this process has been humbling,\" wrote the princess.",
      "Despite acknowledging how fortunate she was to have access to a \"remarkable\" medical team, Beatrice revealed the uncertainty she experienced left her with \"an overwhelming fear of the unknown\".",
      "She wrote: \"Like countless other expectant mums, I lay awake in the weeks leading up to birth, trying to monitor each movement of the baby in my tummy and asking myself a thousand times 'What if this happens, or what if that happens?'\"",
      "Describing how Athena looked when she was born, Beatrice wrote the newborn had been \"so tiny it took more than a few weeks for the tears of relief to dry\".",
      "She said: \"I'm extremely pleased to let you know Athena is now doing really well, I have a few more answers as to what happened, but still no precise explanation.\"",
      "Beatrice expressed her hopes sharing her story would support other mothers going through the same uncertainty and that women's health \"has been left off the agenda\".",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:04:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Government says more NHS funds in England will go to social care as we look at how it can deliver change.",
    "story": [
      "\"That was really quick - straight in, straight out,\" says Phil Brown as he leaves a smart glass building in a shopping centre in Barnsley.",
      "He has just had an ultrasound scan at an NHS centre which sits between familiar High Street names. It is easy-to-reach healthcare - as convenient as popping out to the shops.",
      "This is part of the government's vision for the future of the NHS, soon to be set out in a 10-year plan. In England, ministers have already promised three big changes: shifting more services from hospitals into the community, focusing on preventing ill-health and making more use of new technology.",
      "BBC Panorama spent months in South Yorkshire meeting people already changing how they work, to see what it will take to fix a health service which is buckling under increasing demand.",
      "The NHS also has to cut waiting times, money is tight and the organisation which currently runs it, NHS England, is being scrapped to reduce bureaucracy.",
      "There is another deep-rooted problem - a care system, supporting older and disabled people in the community, that is understaffed, underfunded and in crisis.",
      "Government critics say you cannot reform the NHS unless you reform social care, because it helps get people out of hospital more quickly and prevents some being admitted in the first place.",
      "An independent commission will begin looking at social care reform next month. There will be an interim report, but the final report is not due until 2028.",
      "Challenged on whether you can reform the NHS without changing social care, Health and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting tells Panorama that he doesn't need to wait for a review and plans to divert more NHS money into social care.",
      "\"I want to spend more of our resources through social care, because it delivers better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers,\" he says.",
      "Streeting would not be drawn on how much money would be involved, but said details about spending on social care would be in the 10-year NHS plan.",
      "Most care is paid for by councils, or by the people who need it. It can end up costing some families tens of thousands of pounds. Only those with the very highest needs get help from the NHS.",
      "Future of the NHS",
      "At Barnsley Hospital it used to take about six weeks to get a non-urgent scan, but at the town's NHS centre next to the shops most people are seen in two weeks.",
      "The centre's new scanners and X-ray machines have increased the number of patients staff can see and freed up the hospital so it can concentrate on emergencies and inpatients.",
      "Phil had skin cancer removed four weeks ago from his chin and the consultant wanted to check a couple of pea-sized lumps in his stomach. The scan results will be sent to his GP.",
      "\"It's about peace of mind. You're not waiting for appointments,\" he says.",
      "Liz Elfleet, medical imaging manager at Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust who helped set up the unit, describes this as the future of the NHS.",
      "\"We've seen around a 50% reduction in patients not attending for appointments,\" and the number of women accepting an invitation to have a routine breast screening appointment has risen \"from 43% to just under 80% over the three years,\" she says.",
      "The centre, which offers a range of health checks and scans, was opened in 2022 under the last Conservative government. The current Labour government says many more services will now move out of hospital into the community.",
      "In Barnsley, that is already happening. Part of another shopping centre is being converted into a second, large health hub. The project will be funded by the local council, regional mayor and a government grant.",
      "The leader of Labour-run Barnsley Council, Sir Steve Houghton, says the scanning centre has shown NHS facilities can boost town centres, and they estimate people spend about \u00a317 on average in local businesses when they visit.",
      "Preventing ill-health",
      "The second big shift the NHS is being asked to make is to focus more on preventing ill-health. In Sheffield, a GP practice has already begun to do this, to help them manage a workload which they say had become overwhelming.",
      "Five years ago, Steel City General Practice analysed the data for 10,000 of their patients who needed the most help. \"So we then said, let's actually proactively bring them in. They haven't contacted us - we've contacted them,\" says Dr Krishna Kasaraneni.",
      "GP appointments usually take about 10 minutes, but the Steel City practice gave these patients longer appointments to try to pick up problems earlier. They also took a risk and didn't chase a national target to see all patients within two weeks.",
      "Dr Kasaraneni says it has paid off. \"The numbers of strokes have dropped over that five-year period. Coronary heart disease numbers have dropped,\" he says. It has helped the doctors manage their workload better.",
      "The improved health of the patients has freed up some appointments, and on average people don't wait longer to see someone, but the growing older population means they are still very busy.",
      "While GPs will be crucial to the government's 10-year plan, there are not enough of them. Taking into account those working part-time, the equivalent number of fully qualified, full-time GPs is lower now than it was a decade ago - despite a rising population.",
      "Better use of technology",
      "The third of the big NHS changes is better use of new technology. At Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, they are using AI to speed up the comparison of heart scans.",
      "Before, a radiographer would take about half an hour to manually plot different points around a 3D image of the heart and identify any changes from a scan carried out six months earlier. Now AI tackles it in just a couple of minutes.",
      "Prof Andy Swift, who developed the AI tool with colleagues from the hospital and Sheffield University, says it has been used on 10,000 cases in the past few years. He says it is saving about 30 minutes each time.",
      "\"In the time that we've saved, we've managed to scan more patients and also do more reports for patients,\" he says.",
      "Despite these innovations, change on the scale the government promises is difficult in an NHS struggling to cope with growing demand.",
      "Solving the problems of the NHS also requires tackling the difficulties of social care, which supports around a million older and disabled people in the community.",
      "In February, NHS England figures showed around 14,000 people could not leave hospital, partly because of a lack of home and residential care. More social care can also reduce falls and illnesses.",
      "'We keep pressure off NHS'",
      "The family of Martin - who is 41 and is autistic, with cerebral palsy and epilepsy - say Sheffield care worker Darren Leigh has become like a brother to him over 20 years. Darren knows when Martin is unwell and can quickly get the right help.",
      "\"We keep pressure off the NHS a lot of the time,\" he says. \"There are [also] people in hospital that need to come out but can't because they can't get the care they need.\"",
      "The care system has struggled with underfunding, staff shortages and increasing demand for years. Like many care firms, the not-for-profit company Darren works for says it is \"on a bit of a knife-edge\" as the government is also increasing the costs of employing people. Employer's National Insurance and the National Minimum Wage will go up in April.",
      "The government says it will give councils in England nearly \u00a3900m more for adult and children's social care over the next year. Across the UK, there will be increased support for family carers and a fair pay agreement for staff is being introduced.",
      "Speaking to Panorama, Streeting says social care has a \"big part to play in terms of shifting care out of hospital into the community\". He adds: \"I'm convinced that we can spend NHS resources more effectively through social care.\"",
      "The main opposition parties in England agree social care needs to be reformed.",
      "But the Conservatives say the government has no real plan.",
      "The Liberal Democrats say the NHS cannot be fixed without fixing social care. Reform UK wants to simplify social care through a single funding stream.",
      "And the Green Party is calling for free social care.",
      "There are also questions over whether the NHS has the money to make all the changes the government is promising.",
      "It had a budget of \u00a3171bn in the financial year 2023-2024. It was also given an additional \u00a321bn over two years. NHS Providers, representing trusts across England, says most of that money has been eaten up by everyday pressures including wage rises, inflation and drug price increases.",
      "It warns these competing pressures make the change needed more difficult.",
      "The health and social care secretary agrees that it will not be easy, but says he cannot \"keep on pouring ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers' money into a system that is not set up to deliver best use of that money and best care for patients\"."

      "The spokesperson said the single infected sheep had been \"humanely culled\" and no further cases among the flock were found after \"extensive testing\".",

      "All bar one had been asymptomatic, although they warned the infection \"can be serious\".",
      "The infections were detected in people who had \"close and prolonged contact with a large number of infected birds\".",
      "The spokesperson said the disease continued to infect new mammals and spread between them, \"increasing the opportunities the virus has to evolve\".",

      "The lambs of the affected ewe tested negative for bird flu, the spokesperson added.",

      "The National Sheep Association (NSA), which represents the views and interests of sheep producers in the UK, said mixing different animals was \"questionable at the best of times, but should be avoided when England is undergoing a period of mandatory housing measures for poultry due to bird flu outbreaks\".",

      "The most common problems include doctors failing to spot abnormalities, scans being delayed or not carried out, and results not being followed up properly.",
      "The ombudsman has upheld or partially upheld 45 cases which include failures in medical imaging in the last four years, and says lessons must be learned to avoid the same mistakes again.",
      "NHS England said staff work extremely hard to keep patients safe but acknowledged there was more to do to improve the \"response to serious health issues\".",
      "'My dad's note said he took his life because of the pain'",
      "In one case, medical staff at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough repeatedly failed to diagnose an 82-year-old man with bowel cancer and left him suffering prolonged pain, according to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO).",
      "The man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021.",
      "A scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel.",
      "However, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery.",
      "The patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home.",
      "Later that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body.",
      "Just months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain.",
      "The ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions.",

      "The man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital.",
      "However, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy.",
      "He died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous.",
      "If the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said.",
      "While the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life.",
      "His brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\"",

    "summary": "The coroner at newborn baby Ida Lock's inquest highlights eight opportunities that were missed.",
    "story": [
      "A newborn baby died due to the gross failure of three midwives to provide basic medical care, a coroner has ruled.",
      "Ida Lock was born at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI) on 9 November 2019 but died a week later after suffering a serious brain injury due to a lack of oxygen.",
      "After a five-week inquest at Preston County Hall, coroner James Adeley concluded that Ida's death had been caused by the midwives' failure to deliver the infant \"urgently when it was apparent she was in distress\" and contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation\".",
      "He said there had been eight missed opportunities \"to alter Ida's clinical course\".",
      "The inquest heard that Ida was transferred to the intensive care unit at Royal Preston Hospital's neonatal unit, where she died on 16 November 2019.",
      "The hearing previously heard that an April 2020 report from the independent Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) had identified numerous failings in Ida's care which had contributed to her death.",
      "The review said midwives failed to identify an abnormally slow foetal heart rate after Ida's mother, Sarah Robinson, attended in early labour.",
      "After Ida was born there was ineffective resuscitation, the HSIB concluded.",
      "But an earlier internal \"root cause analysis\" from the hospital in January 2020 found no issues and praised the \"great cohesion and communication\" shown by staff in the delivery suite.",
      "After reading the \"night and day\" contrasting reports, Ida's parents Ms Robinson and Ryan Lock complained to University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMBT), which runs the hospital.",
      "'Wholly incompetent'",
      "Delivering his conclusion, Dr Adeley, said: \"Ida was a normal child whose death was caused by a lack of oxygen during her delivery that occurred due to the gross failure of the three midwives attending her to provide basic medical care to deliver Ida urgently when it was apparent she was in distress.\"",
      "And he noted that her death was contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent\" failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation during the first three-and-half minutes of her life.",
      "This, he said, further contributed to the infant's brain damage.",
      "The senior coroner also criticised the hospital's investigation into Ida's death, calling it a \"damning indictment of an ineffective, dysfunctional and callous system that has failed this family at every opportunity\".",
      "UHMBT was the subject of a damning report in 2015 that found a \"lethal mix\" of problems at another of its maternity units at Furness General Hospital that led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother between 2004 and 2013.",
      "The Morecambe Bay investigation, chaired by Dr Bill Kirkup, uncovered a series of failures \"at every level\", from the unit itself to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust.",
      "In a statement, Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer of UHMBT, said: \"Losing a child is tragic and our heartfelt condolences go out to Ida's parents, family and loved ones. We are truly sorry for the distress we have caused.",
      "\"We accept that we failed Ida and her family and if we had done some things differently and sooner, Ida would still be here today.",
      "\"We also acknowledge the additional upset caused to Ida's parents and family as a result of the way investigations into Ida's death have been conducted since 2019.",
      "\"For that, we are truly sorry.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest.",
      "\"We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",

      "The inquiry has heard from previous witnesses, including the government's former chief commercial officer Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, that the appeal was counterproductive, leading to a large number of approaches which threatened to overwhelm the system.",
      "\"We were radically short of PPE [at the time] and the country was about to run out at a national level,\" Hancock told the inquiry.",
      "\"No-one has testified that the call to arms led to anything other than more PPE\u2026 So I stand by that.\"",

      "The inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or  other countries around the world.",
      "\"It's fine having academics write papers about this stuff\u2026 but you've got to understand what it was like [at the time],\" said Hancock.",
      "\"The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that.\"",
      "He said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways.",
      "Hancock was later asked about a contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing.",
      "Emails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a \"very interesting critique\" from a \"very impressive guy\".",
      "In questioning, Hancock said he acted with \"impeccable behaviour\" at the time, and accused the inquiry's chief counsel Richard Wald KC of cherry-picking a \"couple of messages\" that have the \"most tabloid interest\".",
      "He said the inquiry had followed a \"wholly naive\" line of questioning by ignoring the reality of the situation at the time, while making \"terribly pejorative\" statements that were \"totally inappropriate\".",
      "At the conclusion of his evidence, Baroness Hallett told Hancock that he \"was not the first and I'm sure won't be the last witness to think the inquiry is all about criticising people\".",
      "\"My aim is to investigate what happened, to explore matters of public concern, to get people to answer on those areas, and to try to come up with recommendations that will save lives,\" she added."

      "The chancellor's rules, which she has argued will bring stability to the UK economy, are that day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing; and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029/30.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said it was the chancellor's decisions that were the cause of sluggish growth forecasts, leading to the imposition of cuts.",
      "\"We wouldn't be here because we would not have put those confidence-destroying taxes on the economy,\" he told BBC Breakfast.",
      "\"We would have made different decisions, tackled welfare reform earlier - she's doing that now but if it's a moral mission of this government, why didn't they do it nine months ago?\"",

      "Last month, the government cut the international aid budget to boost defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, as leaders across Europe looked to overhaul defence policies over fears the US could make a deal with Russia to end the Ukraine war which leaves the continent vulnerable.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:51:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The Spring Statement is \"not a Budget\", but the chancellor is facing major tax and spending challenges.",
    "story": [
      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about Wednesday's economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before President Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "On Wednesday, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",
      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",
      "What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving.",
      "On Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and artificial intelligence.",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Reeves confirms 15% cut to Civil Service running costs",
      "Rachel Reeves: I will not 'tax and spend'",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

      "English councils will be ranked according to their pothole fixing progress under government plans, with those who fail to publish updates losing out on millions in funding.",
      "The Department for Transport (DfT) said local authorities' road maintenance pot would be boosted by \u00a3500m from mid-April, but councils must publish annual reports detailing progress on potholes or lose a quarter of that extra funding.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC this would produce a rating system \"so we know who is the best and who is not the best\".",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said the government should focus on preventative measures rather than \"reactively\" fixing potholes.",
      "Clearing the country's backlog of road repairs would take more than a decade and cost almost \u00a317bn to fix, the LGA said, citing a survey from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.",
      "According to data from the RAC, there are six potholes for every mile of road in England and Wales.",
      "All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.",
      "The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.",
      "The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC a RAG (red, amber, green) rating system would be produced for councils on pothole maintenance.",
      "He said that \"until now, nobody has known how many potholes are being filled and where they're being filled\".",
      "\"We all have the experience of driving from one place to the next and we know some places are better than others,\" he said, adding that the RAG system will help to avoid \"the lottery that we have now\".",
      "'Not helpful'",
      "However, Lucy Nethsingha, leader of Cambridgeshire County Council and chair of the LGA's Liberal Democrat group, said the amount of money was \"nowhere near the amount that is needed\".",
      "\"The implication that we are not spending it well is not helpful,\" she said, adding that the government was announcing \"stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics\".",
      "\"It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful,\" she said.",
      "She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall \u00a3410m while the money the government was \"re-announcing\" for the whole of England was \u00a3500m.",
      "\"Our roads are like a worn out pair of trousers, you can keep fixing the holes, but what you actually need is a new pair of trousers - or in this case a proper resurfacing.\"",
      "But the prime minister said \"any council that says to me it's not enough money, I'd say come back to see me in June when you've actually filled these potholes in with your RAG rating and then we'll see if we can release more money to you\".",
      "\"Don't start the exercise complaining that you haven't got enough money.\"",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"not pretending that the money we're making available will fill every pothole\".",
      "Asked whether withholding cash from some councils would just make things worse for drivers in some areas, she said she expected most local authorities would be able to \"comply with these requirements\".",
      "\"We want councils to be open and honest about how they are using that money so that the public can go onto their local council's website and see what action is being taken,\" she said.",

      "The DfT added that councils who \"fail to meet these strict conditions\" will see 25% of the funding withheld.",
      "During the election campaign, Labour pledged to repair up to a million potholes a year in England.",
      "'Preventative measures'",
      "The LGA said it was in \"everyone's interests to ensure that public money is well spent\".",
      "\"This includes the government playing its full part by using the Spending Review to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures rather than reactively fixing potholes, which is more expensive,\" it added.",

      "During his interview, Witkoff also repeated several Kremlin talking points about the cause of Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "He said it was \"correct\" that from the Russian perspective the partially occupied territories were now part of Russia: \"The elephant in the room is, there are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory. The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\"",

      "Putin has repeatedly said that the \"root causes\" of his invasion were the threat posed to Russia by an expanded Nato and the sheer existence of Ukraine as an independent country.",
      "Witkoff said in the Tucker Carlson interview: \"Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose? They don't need to absorb Ukraine\u2026 They have reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea and they have gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\"",
      "Asked about Keir Starmer's plans to forge a \"coalition of the willing\" to provide military security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, Witkoff said: \"I think it's a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic. There is this sort of notion that we have all got to be like [British wartime prime minister] Winston Churchill. Russians are going to march across Europe. That is preposterous by the way.

      "The prime minister has pledged to tackle the crisis of people crossing the Channel on small boats and to \"significantly\" cut net migration.",
      "He previously scrapped a Conservative scheme to send migrants who had arrived in small boats to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed there.",
      "Unlike that scheme, the new proposals would apply only to asylum seekers whose claims had been rejected and who had no further routes of appeal.",
      "Overseas centres would enable the government to remove failed asylum seekers who come from countries deemed unsafe for them to be returned to, such as Iran and Somalia, as well as to host other rejected claimants before transfer to removal flights to their home countries.",
      "The proposals follow moves by the European Commission to endorse the use of \"return hubs\" by members of the EU.",

      "It said families with children, and unaccompanied children, would be excluded from the scheme.",
      "Any return hub scheme would require officials to strike deals with countries housing the centres.",

      "Officials believe it could also help to alleviate the pressure on local authority budgets from failed asylum seekers who are homeless and whom they are legally obliged to support.",
      "However, any scheme involving overseas centres for migrants is likely to face legal challenges as well as fierce opposition from refugee charities.",
      "Italy has sought to process migrant claims at two detention centres in Albania but has been blocked from doing so by the Italian courts.",
      "A government source said the issue was \"a shared challenge right across the world and we've always said this international problem needs an international solutions\".",
      "\"That's why we're looking at the widest possible set of options with a completely open mind.",

      "\"We know from our work that working with people and supporting them to return to the countries they've come from is far more successful than shipping them somewhere like Albania where they're going to be detained in what will inevitably be prison-like conditions.\"",

      "Speaking to reporters in Harrogate during the Lib Dem spring conference, Sir Ed said he was \"glad that the government scrapped the Rwanda scheme because it wasn't working as a deterrent\".",
      "\"In fact, hardly anybody went, and it was costing huge amounts of money. If they've got a better scheme that will work, we'll look at that\".",

      "The party is still neck-and-neck with Labour in the polls, and on Monday, it showed off 29 councillors who had recently defected to Reform UK.",
      "While Farage acknowledged there had been \"a little bit of turbulence\", he stressed the upset was \"very much at the edges\".",
      "But does the disquiet within the party go deeper than he suggested?",
      "Divisions have become more acute in a party that now boasts more than 200,000 members and 400 local branches across the country.",
      "Much of the anger is directed at Farage and Reform's chairman, Zia Yusuf, over their efforts to professionalise the party.",
      "The party is being more ruthless in its vetting of candidates. It's also investigating - and in some cases expelling - members because of their activity on social media.",

      "The BBC has learned at least 12 interim chairs of local Reform UK branches have resigned over the conduct of the party's leadership in recent months.",
      "A Reform UK spokesman said the resignations amounted to 2% of its branch chairs.",
      "\"Our understanding is that the other parties have much higher churn than that,\" the spokesman said.",
      "\"We are sorry that we have lost 2% of our branch chairs, some of whom failed vetting. But we're the only major party that does this sort of vetting.\"",
      "One of the chairs was Maria Bowtell, a councillor on East Riding of Yorkshire Council who gave a speech at Reform UK's party conference last year.",
      "In her resignation letter, she said she felt \"abandoned\" in her role, described the party's candidate selection as \"chaotic\", and accused the leadership of lacking integrity.",
      "Other members have quit on free-speech grounds, including Howard Cox, who stood as a Reform UK candidate in the general election and the London mayoral poll.",
      "He said he left the party after he was threatened with expulsion for criticising the treatment of Tommy Robinson, a prominent far-right activist.",
      "Cox told the BBC \"my inboxes are now flooded with grassroots Reformers who are incredibly upset and feel that their political optimism for our country has been betrayed\".",
      "\"Over a dozen Reform branches have contacted me, stating that they have been replaced, overridden, and disrespected by Zia Yusuf's headquarters team,\" he added.",
      "Other branch chairs resigned over policy differences, particularly the issue of \"mass deportations\", which Farage has called a \"political impossibility\".",
      "Jack Davison, the former chair of the Dover and Deal branch, said in attempting to professionalise, the party was adopting the \"very traits of the establishment it sought to challenge\".",
      "\"This culture of 'silencing' was deeply troubling,\" he said.",

      "The MP was been suspended by Reform UK over accusations of bullying in his office, and a police investigation into alleged threats against the party's chairman, Yusuf.",
      "Lowe has denied any wrongdoing and his supporters have rallied around him, accusing the leadership of trying to force him out for daring to challenge Farage.",
      "The row came as no surprise to Ben Habib, a former Reform UK deputy leader who quit the party citing \"fundamental differences\" with Farage.",
      "He told the BBC that Farage's idea of professionalisation \"would appear to be the wilful destruction of the grassroots movement\".",
      "\"The playbook used against Rupert Lowe has been used across the grassroots,\" he said.",
      "'Teething issues'",
      "The BBC put some of these criticisms to the party's chairman, Yusuf.",

      "Yusuf, who was appointed chairman after the general election last year, said the party had vetted thousands of people and \"the majority have passed\".",
      "But some don't, he said, adding that \"just comes with the territory of being a professional party\".",
      "Reform UK's vetting system, Yusuf said, was \"meaningfully more rigorous than anything that the other parties do\".",
      "\"Of course, anything growing at this scale, there'll be some teething issues,\" he added.",
      "The recent ructions do appear to have cut through to the voting public though.",
      "One recent survey suggested that the party was split with a third of Reform voters believing the party would be faring better under a different leader, but the same amount believing that the party would be doing worse.",
      "The survey also suggested that Farage's net favourability with Reform voters had fallen since the Lowe row.",
      "Yet the latest YouGov poll put Reform UK on 23% of the vote, behind Labour on 24% but ahead of the Conservatives on 22%.",
      "Gawain Towler still believes in Farage's leadership, despite being sacked as Reform UK's head of press last year.",
      "Towler said he had been to several branch meetings as a speaker recently and had witnessed very little dissent.",
      "He said Reform UK won 4.1 million votes at last year's general election \"with a ramshackle operation and an army of volunteers who worked their socks off for no recompense whatsoever\".",
      "\"We need to get at least 10 million to win,\" Towler said. \"You're not going to find six million votes to our right. You'd be mad to appease some screamy people on the outside of the party.\"",
      "For now, the party's focus is trained on the upcoming local elections. It has high hopes in Lincolnshire where its candidate Andrea Jenkyns, a former Tory MP, is vying to be mayor.",
      "Reform UK sources say internal private polling has left them optimistic about winning what would be its highest elected office to date.",
      "But to become a serious contender to win a general election, Reform UK may have to get a firmer grip on its grassroots.",
      "It may also have to convince members to back some of the messy compromises that other mainstream parties make to attract more voters."

      "Most governments in wealthy nations have such rules, which are designed to reassure investors and maintain credibility with financial markets.",

      "Isabel Stockton, senior researcher for the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said Reeves had \"boxed herself in with promises to meet her fiscal targets, not to raise taxes further and not to return to austerity for public services\".",

      "Reform has always denied there was any connection between Lowe's suspension and his criticism of the party.",
      "In his Mail interview on 5 March, Lowe called Reform a \"protest party\" led by \"the Messiah\". He was suspended on 7 March and reported to police over claims he had made threats of violence against party chairman Zia Yusuf.",

      "He has since accused Farage of a \"malicious witch hunt\" and being motivated \"to remove me because I dared to ask questions\".",

      "In a report, the Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises the use of taxpayers' money, cast doubt on whether the government would hit its own target of resolving the building safety crisis by 2029.",
      "It concluded that a new plan aimed at speeding up progress was \"insufficiently ambitious and at risk of not delivering what is promised\".",

    "story": [
      "Claims an independent football regulator could stifle the growth of the Premier League and foreign investment in it are \"complete nonsense\", English Football League (EFL) chairman Rick Parry has told the BBC.",
      "Under a change to a government bill going through Parliament, the proposed regulator will have a duty to avoid having a negative impact on the financial growth of the English game.",
      "But a government source has played down reports No 10 is considering scaling back the regulator's powers as part of a wider move to cut bureaucracy.",
      "Mr Parry said the changes being put forward would benefit the whole of the men's professional game, but well-off clubs had \"nothing to fear\" from them.",
      "'Football regulator bill could be law by summer'",
      "Football regulator to have power to tackle parachute payments",
      "Football regulator a waste of money - Badenoch",
      "The Football Governance Bill is due to complete its House of Lords stages next week, after which it will be sent to the Commons for MPs to consider.",
      "It would establish a regulator which is independent from government and the sport's authorities to oversee the men's game in England's top five divisions.",
      "The regulator would set out mandatory conditions for clubs to meet, relating to corporate governance and financial reporting.",
      "Clubs would also be required to provide \"effective engagement\" with fans on changes to ticket prices and any proposals to relocate home grounds.",
      "Under \"backstop powers\", the regulator could intervene between the Premier League and the EFL if they fail to agree a deal to redistribute money to EFL clubs, many of which are cash-strapped.",
      "Previous rounds of talks have collapsed.",
      "The Premier League has repeatedly argued that English football is capable of regulating itself, and said it is critical that any external regulation is \"proportionate\".",
      "It has warned of \"unintended consequences of legislation that could weaken the competitiveness and appeal of \u00adEnglish football\".",
      "'Light touch'",
      "Bloomberg UK has reported that, following lobbying from Premier League owners, No 10 is looking again at some of the bill's measures, to ensure foreign investors are not discouraged from buying English clubs.",
      "Both Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves have put economic growth and investment at the centre of their programme for government.",
      "Last week, the prime minister announced that NHS England would be abolished   and brought under \"democratic control\" to cut bureaucracy.",
      "He said for too long politicians had \"chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos\" - organisations funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by the government.",
      "However, the source at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which is piloting the bill through Parliament, indicated to the BBC it was aligned with Downing Street on the need for a \"light touch\" football regulator.",
      "Mr Parry told the BBC different parts of government often had different views.",
      "But he said he was encouraged by the way ministers had successfully resisted attempts by Conservative peers to weaken the legislation in the Lords last week, with \"an impressive whipping operation\".",
      "The impetus for an independent regulator has been years in the making, with several lower division clubs subjected to financial mismanagement and. in some cases like Bury and Macclesfield Town, complete collapse.",
      "Mr Parry, the Premier League's first chief executive in 1992 and a former chief executive at Liverpool, said many MPs, particularly in northern towns, were very aware that lower league football clubs were at \"the heart of their communities\".",
      "'Unbridgeable chasm'",
      "There was \"not a shred of evidence\" for Premier League clubs' arguments that their financial competitiveness could be undermined by the proposed regulator, he added.",
      "\"No one wants to kill the golden goose or impose unnecessary bureaucracy\", but the Premier League had to \"discharge its responsibilities\", he argued.",
      "Mr Parry pointed to a \"growing gulf\" between the Premier League and the EFL, saying an \u00a311m gap in finances had soared to \u00a33.3bn since 1992.",
      "An increasingly \"unbridgeable chasm\" was highlighted by the fact that all three clubs promoted from the Championship in 2023 had been immediately relegated the following season - and that was looking likely to happen again this season - he said.",
      "The bill was initially introduced in March 2024 by the previous Conservative government, following a fan-led review headed by former sports minister Tracey Crouch.",
      "But it ran out of parliamentary time when Rishi Sunak called a general election.",
      "When it took office, Labour reintroduced the bill, promising to protect clubs' \"financial sustainability\".",
      "Under Kemi Badenoch, the Tories have shifted their position and now oppose the bill.",
      "Badenoch has argued it will be \"a waste of money\".",
      "Mr Parry said he still wanted to engage with the Conservative leadership on the merits of a regulator, adding that he believed many grassroots Tories still backed the idea."

      "However Cambridge Crown Court this month heard how triple murderer Kyle Clifford viewed Andrew Tate videos before shooting his ex-girlfriend Louise Hunt and her sister Hannah with a crossbow and stabbing their mother Carol Hunt.",
      "\"The work required is vast and complex,\" the statement read to the Commons said.",
      "\"Long term reduction in knife crime will only be seen if we go back to the start and raise our children better.\"",

      "Rudakubana was jailed for a minimum of 52 years for the murders, along with the attempted murders of eight other children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, class instructor Leanne Lucas and businessman John Hayes.",
      "Child A's family said: \"It is sensible to make it harder to purchase knives [and] to tighten the law carrying knives. These are tangible solutions that provide a quick reassurance and results.",
      "\"But, if a young person is looking for a knife, then we are too late, and they are already on the path to causing harm.\"",
      "The family said the upcoming public inquiry into the Southport attacks would \"serve the purpose\" of improving things for parents, caregivers and school-leavers.",
      "Mr Foster told the Commons: \"I commend that child's parents for having the courage to write that, and the concern that they have clearly that this is going to happen again.",

      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy and an economic forecast when she makes her Spring Statement, on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event each year - the Budget.",
      "As a result, government sources have been keen to stress that the Spring Statement is not a major financial event.",
      "Reeves has ruled out \"tax and spend\" policies, signalling that she will neither raise taxes nor government budgets.",
      "However, with the government under pressure over its finances, she is expected to announce spending cuts and some big changes aimed at saving money have already been announced.",
      "Welfare spending",
      "Spending cuts aimed at making savings of \u00a35bn year by 2030 from the welfare bill were outlined last week.",
      "Policies include stricter tests for personal independence payments, affecting hundreds of thousands of claimants, and a freeze on incapacity benefits. More detail on the impact of the cuts are expected on Wednesday.",
      "Civil service",
      "The chancellor has pledged to reduce government running costs by 15% by the end of the decade, with about 10,000 civil service jobs expected to go.",
      "Sectors such as human resources, policy advice, communications and office management are expected to be affected by the cutbacks.",
      "Aid and defence",
      "In setting out her choices the chancellor is likely to argue the \"world has changed\".",
      "The government has said it will increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027. We should get more details on how this money will be reallocated from international aid spending.",
      "Tax changes",
      "Tax rises have been repeatedly ruled out by the chancellor, but UK taxes on big firms could be changed as part of a deal to avoid US trade tariffs.",
      "Reeves has revealed talks are \"ongoing\" about tweaks to the 2% Digital Services Tax (DST), which raises about \u00a3800m a year from global tech giants such as Amazon and Meta.",

      "Before Reeves makes her statement in Parliament, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings and her plans for the economy alongside this.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What about Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "Reeves has two main rules on borrowing:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "She has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "However, the OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "The pressure on Reeves grew on Friday, when it was announced that UK government borrowing was higher than expected in February, at \u00a310.7bn.",
      "The economy is seen to be underperforming, thanks in part to global factors indirectly affecting the UK such as US trade tariffs.",
      "This has fuelled further speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been weak.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target and is forecast to go higher.",
      "Inflation could affect whether interest rates are lowered further from 4.5% as the Bank moves rates in response to inflation.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "UK government borrowing costs also remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, with the US imposing tariffs worldwide, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "summary": "On social media a self-proclaimed earthquake predictor says he can forecast big shakes, but experts say it's pure luck.",
    "story": [
      "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor.",
      "In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka.",
      "Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one.",
      "\"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve.",
      "But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say.",
      "It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.",
      "Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events.",
      "For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Ms Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code.",
      "\"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\"",
      "With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning.",
      "The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows.",
      "The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction.",
      "It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur.",
      "Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Ms Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare.",
      "The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region.",
      "While the guess was correct, Ms Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy.",
      "There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Ms Jones said.",
      "The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet.",
      "Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".",
      "The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come.",
      "Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis.",
      "While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region.",
      "Ms Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them.",
      "\"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\"",
      "Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade.",

      "Thousands evacuate Santorini as more earthquakes strike island",
      "The USGS says an earthquake prediction must have three defined elements - a date and time, the location of the earthquake and the magnitude - in order to be of any use.",
      "But Mr Dmitruk's timeline keeps shifting.",
      "At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030.",
      "While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur.",
      "\"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\"",
      "This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Ms Jones said.",
      "\"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said.",
      "\"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\"",
      "How you can prepare for the uncertainty of a quake",
      "But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said.",
      "Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out.",
      "It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Ms Jones.",
      "During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute.",
      "The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries.",
      "If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami.",
      "\"Now, while the ground is not shaking, while it's not a very stressful situation, is really the best time to practise,\" said Brian Terbush, the Earthquake and Volcano Program Manager for the Washington state Emergency Management Division.",
      "Apart from the drills, residents of West Coast states use a phone alert system maintained by USGS called ShakeAlert.",
      "The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far.",

    "summary": "New research could force a fundamental rethink of the nature of space and time.",
    "story": [
      "The mysterious force called Dark Energy, which drives the expansion of the Universe, might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space, scientists have found.",
      "Some of them believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation - one that could force a fundamental rethink.",
      "This early-stage finding is at odds with the current theory which was developed in part by Albert Einstein.",
      "More data is needed to confirm these results, but even some of the most cautious and respected researchers involved in the study, such as Prof Ofer Lahav, from University College London, are being swept up by the mounting evidence.",
      "\"It is a dramatic moment,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We may be witnessing a paradigm shift in our understanding of the Universe.\"",
      "The discovery of Dark Energy in 1998 was in itself shocking. Up until then the view had been that after the Big Bang, which created the Universe, its expansion would slow down under the force of gravity.",
      "But observations by US and Australian scientists found that it was actually speeding up. They had no idea what the force driving this was, so they gave it a name signifying their lack of understanding - Dark Energy.",
      "Although we don't know what Dark Energy is - it is one of the greatest mysteries in science - astronomers can measure it and whether it is changing by observing the acceleration of galaxies away from each other at different points in the history of the Universe.",
      "Several experiments were built to find answers, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson Arizona. It consists of 5,000 optical fibres, each one of which is a robotically controlled telescope scanning galaxies at high speed.",
      "Last year, when DESI researchers found hints that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, many scientists thought that it was a blip in the data which would go away.",
      "Instead, a year on, that blip has grown.",
      "\"The evidence is stronger now than it was,\" said Prof Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Portsmouth",
      "\"We've also performed many additional tests compared to the first year, and they're making us confident that the results aren't driven by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't accounted for,\" he said.",
      "'Weird' results",
      "The data has not yet passed the threshold of being described as a discovery, but has led many astronomers, such as Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, of Edinburgh University, to sit up and take notice.",
      "\"Dark Energy appears to be even weirder than we thought,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"In 2024 the data was quite new, no-one was quite sure of it and people thought more work needed to be done.",
      "\"But now, there's more data, and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, while there is still a chance that the 'blip' may go away, there's also a possibility that we might be edging to a really big discovery.\"",
      "So what is causing the variation?",
      "\"No one knows!\" Prof Lahav admits, cheerfully.",
      "\"If this new result is correct, then we need to find the mechanism that causes the variation and that might mean a brand new theory, which makes this so exciting.\"",
      "DESI will continue to take more data over the next two years, with plans to measure roughly 50 million galaxies and other bright objects, in an effort to nail down whether their observations are unequivocally correct.",
      "\"We're in the business of letting the Universe tell us how it works, and maybe it is telling us it's more complicated than we thought it was,\" said Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in California.",
      "More details on the nature of Dark Energy will be obtained by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid mission, a space telescope which will probe further than DESI and obtain even greater detail. It was launched in 2023 and ESA released the new images from the spacecraft today.",
      "The DESI collaboration involves more than 900 researchers from more than 70 institutions, around the world, including Durham, UCL and Portsmouth University from the UK."

      "The Neuralink chip looks to restore a fraction of his previous independence, by allowing him to control a computer with his mind.",

      "Musk was cagey in public at the time, simply writing in a social media post: \"Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.\"",
      "In reality, Noland said, the billionaire - who he spoke to before and after his surgery - was far more optimistic.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

      "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed opposition political parties for provoking a \"movement of violence\", as protests in the country continue for a sixth night.",
      "Unrest began in Istanbul last Wednesday when the city's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, Erdogan's main presidential rival, was detained on corruption charges.",
      "Thousands of people gathered once again on Monday. Unrest had escalated on Sunday night, with protesters fired on with tear gas and rubber bullets.",

      "Speaking from Ankara, Turkey's capital, he called for the protests to end and said that \"instead of responding to allegations\", opposition parties had \"made the most vile and unlawful statements in our political history for [the last] five days\".",

      "He spent Sunday night in jail after being formally arrested and charged earlier that day with \"establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender\".",
      "In a post on X over the weekend, Imamoglu said he would \"never bow\" and criticised his arrest as a \"black stain on our democracy\".",
      "He also sent greetings to those protesting and said that voters had showed Turkey had had \"enough\" of Erdogan.",
      "The demonstrations seen in recent days are the largest in Turkey since the Gezi protests of 2013, which began in Istanbul over the demolition of a local park.",

      "Beneath the acrid smell of tear gas on the night air in Istanbul, there is a hint of something else - a whiff of panic on the part of Turkey's long-time leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "One of his rivals has been put behind bars - so far, so familiar.",
      "But the jailing of Ekrem Imamoglu, the popular mayor of Istanbul, suggests President Erdogan is rattled \u2013 and he may have gone too far. The mayor's opposition Republican People's party (CHP), which is summoning vast crowds onto the streets, is certainly hoping so.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu - always smartly turned out, even as he prepared to be detained - is the main rival to Turkey's increasingly authoritarian leader. He could well replace him in presidential elections due to be held by 2028 - assuming he is free to contest them.",
      "But this is far more than a row about the fate of Istanbul's mayor - charismatic though he may be.",
      "Freedom and democracy have been steadily eroded in the Erdogan era. Many see this as a chance to call halt and stop the descent into all-out autocracy - if it's not already too late.",

      "Who is Turkish opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu?",
      "Why are thousands of people protesting in Turkey?",
      "More than 1,000 people have been detained so far - in just 5 days - and counting. That's an indication of how easy it is to be arrested here.",
      "Turkey claims to be a functioning democracy - and at face value, it is. There are elections. Voter turnout is usually high - Turks cherish their right to go to the polls and cast their ballots. Voting is largely fair, on the day itself.",
      "The problem is what happens away from the polling stations.",
      "Opposition politicians can be jailed. Critics intimidated. Protesters arrested. The media is largely government controlled. A tweet ridiculing the president could land you in a cell. By the time polling day comes around there's a tsunami of pro-government coverage and the opposition struggles to get a look in.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu is the type of politician who can cut through all this and reach the voters. He's media savvy and has been elected mayor of Istanbul three times. Now he's accused of embezzlement, taking bribes and running a criminal organisation.",
      "If convicted he could be barred from standing in the presidential race. He's already appealing a previous conviction and sentence of two years in prison, for insulting election officials.",
      "Turkey insists that its courts are independent and simply follow the law. Human rights activists here, and independent analysts, scoff at that idea.",
      "The campaign group, Human Rights Watch, said the detention of the mayor, along with about 100 other municipal officials and politicians, is a \"politically motivated move to stifle lawful political activities\". In the past it has criticised \"politicised decisions by courts\" in Turkey.",
      "In a post on X, where he has 9.6m followers, Imamoglu said the case against him was \"a black stain on our democracy\", adding: \"I stand tall. I will never bow.\"",
      "That's what Erdogan, 71, may be afraid of - an opponent who is younger, at 53, also appeals to conservative Turkish voters, and is ready for a long fight.",
      "So, what happens now?",
      "The protests could gain momentum and keep spreading. That will present a serious challenge to Erdogan. How long before his heavily armed security forces crack down even harder? How long before someone loses their life at a protest? There is a breaking point for every strongman regime, and it can come with a single bullet.",
      "The opposition intends to keep up the pressure, and the demonstrations.",
      "But after his two decades at the top, Erdogan still has plenty of loyal supporters. He controls virtually all the levers of power and seems determined to hang on. He will be banking on the demonstrations petering out, over time.",
      "The president and his ruling AK party will be hoping the protesters will grow weary and go back to worrying about crushing inflation (39% in February), and the dwindling value of the Turkish lira, rather than free speech, and democracy.",

    "summary": "A \"distorted\" portrait in the US was removed after the president complained, but he was \"touched\" by a Russian gift.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has been gifted a new portrait from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin - while trashing an existing painting of him as \"truly the worst\".",
      "The new portrait has not been shown publicly. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described it as a \"personal gift\", adding that only Putin himself could disclose further details.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump took to Truth Social to criticise an earlier picture of him that hung in the Colorado State Capitol building until it was removed on Monday.",
      "The US president has paid close attention to cultivating his image, and made headlines in January by unveiling an official portrait that was variously described by critics as serious or ominous.",
      "Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed receipt of the new work from Moscow, saying he had been asked to transport it back to Washington.",
      "He described the work as a painting - a \"beautiful portrait\" by a \"leading Russian artist\" - but gave no further critique. Trump was \"clearly touched by it\", he added.",
      "The gift was confirmed by Peskov, as American and Russian negotiators again sat down for talks in Saudi Arabia as part of Trump's drive to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "The gift highlights the diplomatic thaw between the two nations after Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "In an interview, Witkoff - who met Putin 10 days ago - said the Russian president had been \"gracious\". Putin told him, he added, that he had prayed for Trump after an assassination attempt against him last year.",
      "That attempt on Trump's life - which took place during a rally in Pennsylvania - gave rise to perhaps the most iconic image of him ever produced.",
      "AP photographer Evan Vucci caught the moment that Trump, with a bloody ear, held up a defiant fist and told supporters to \"fight, fight, fight\". That image was further mythologised by Trump, who used it to adorn the cover of a book.",

      "The 17th Century painting that unlocks Trump's portrait",
      "Dramatic images from rally at which Trump survived assassination effort",
      "'Purposefully distorted'",
      "Trump is yet to publicly comment on the image that was sent by Putin - but he left no doubt of the kind of portraiture he liked and disliked when delivering his views on the Colorado image.",
      "The painting, which was presented to the building in 2019, was \"purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before\", he wrote on Truth Social on Monday morning.",
      "That was unlike the same artist's depiction of Barack Obama, Trump wrote. Offering rare praise for his predecessor, Trump said Obama looked \"wonderful\" in his own portrait by the same artist, English-born Sarah Boardman.",
      "Trump reportedly lost up to 30lb (13.6kg) during last year's presidential campaign. He told reporters he had been \"so busy\" he had not \"been able to eat very much\".",
      "The Republican also used the portrait to make a political point - describing Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, as \"radical\" and \"extremely weak on crime\".",
      "But the portrait had nothing to do with Polis, US media pointed out. It was instead the result of a crowdfunding campaign that was launched by a Republican. The portrait was reportedly commissioned to fill an empty space that had briefly been filled with an image of Vladimir Putin by a prankster.",
      "Following the backlash, Colorado House leadership ordered the painting removed on Monday afternoon, according to a spokesman for Colorado's House Democrats. It will be kept in a secure location \"until further notice\".",
      "The BBC has contacted Ms Boardman for comment. Discussing her work with the Colorado Times Recorder in 2019, she acknowledged that there would \"always be anger at a president from one side or the other. It is human nature.\"",
      "Another portrait artist told the BBC he \"would have painted things slightly differently\", but that presidential portraits were nuanced, and he had sympathy for the artist.",
      "Robert Anderson, who created the official portrait of President George W Bush which hangs in the US National Portrait Gallery, said viewers tended to bring \"baggage\" depending on their feelings about the painting's subject.",
      "For that reason, the reaction to an artwork often had \"very little to do with the quality of art\", he said.",
      "Of Trump, Mr Anderson said: \"I think it would be very difficult to paint him because he has a particular impression of himself which might be very different to that of many others \u2013 probably at least half of the country.\"",
      "A spokesman for Polis told 9News said the governor was \"surprised to learn the president of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado State Capitol and its artwork\".",
      "The statement continued: \"We appreciate the president and everyone's interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience.\""

    "story": [
      "US funding cuts will lead to an additional 2,000 new HIV infections each day and over six million further deaths over the next four years, the UNAids chief has warned.",
      "It would mark a stark reversal in the global fight against HIV, which has seen the number of deaths from the disease decrease from more than two million in 2004 to 600,000 in 2023, the most recent year for which figures are available.",
      "UNAids Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said the US government's decision to pause foreign aid - which included funding for HIV programmes - was already having devastating consequences.",
      "She called on the US to reverse the cuts immediately, warning women and girls were being hit particularly hard.",
      "US President Donald Trump announced the pause on foreign aid, for an initial 90 days, on his first day in office in January as part of a review into government spending. The majority of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) programmes have since been terminated.",
      "Many US-financed HIV treatment and prevention programmes received stop work orders, leading to the closure of mother and baby clinics in Africa, and severe shortages of life saving anti-retroviral (ARV) medicines.",
      "Ms Byanyima said she feared a return to the 1990s, when HIV medication was scarcely available in poorer countries, and infections and deaths soared.",
      "The US has for years been the single biggest funder of HIV treatment and prevention, and Ms Byanima thanked Washington for its generosity and humanity.",
      "She added it was \"reasonable\" for the US \"to want to reduce its funding - over time\", but said the \"sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support [was] having a devastating impact\".",
      "There has been no sign that Washington is listening to appeals to change course.",
      "Traditional aid donors in Europe also plan funding cuts, and UNAids - the joint UN agency which combats HIV - has had no indication that other countries might step in to fill the gap left by the US.",
      "What is USAID and why is Trump poised to 'close it down'?",
      "Speaking in Geneva on Monday, Ms Byanyima described the case of Juliana, a young woman in Kenya living with HIV. She worked for a US-funded programme that supported new mothers to access treatment to ensure their babies did not develop the disease.",
      "With the programme suspended, Ms Byanyima said Juliana was not only out of work but, because she was still breastfeeding her youngest child, she also feared losing the treatment she needed.",
      "Previously, the World Health Organization (WHO) said eight countries - Nigeria, Kenya, Lesotho, South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Mali, Haiti and Ukraine - could soon run out of HIV drugs after the US funding pause.",
      "WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that disruption to HIV programmes \"could undo 20 years of progress\".",
      "In February, South Africa's leading Aids lobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), warned the country could see a return to when HIV patients struggled to access necessary services for their treatment.",
      "\"We can't afford to die, we can't afford to go back to those years where we were suffering with access to services, especially for people living with HIV treatment,\" said TAC chair Sibongile Tshabalala.",

      "Lenacapavir, made by US company Gilead, is given by injection every six months, with UNAids believing 10 million people could benefit from it.",
      "The profits and jobs resulting from such a deal would be hugely beneficial to the US, Ms Byanyima added.",

      "According to organisers, Mr O'Connell was performing a \"routine display\" on a retired military aircraft when it \"experienced a sudden loss of altitude and entered a steep dive\".",
      "An investigation into the accident is currently underway as tributes pour in for the seasoned former Air Force pilot.",
      "Mr O'Connell's crash was captured by numerous videos and images which have since been shared widely on social media.",
      "In one, the 68-year-old aircraft, an Impala Mark 1, can be seen flying upside-down before returning to its original position and then nose-diving to the ground.",
      "A huge cloud of smoke and fire can then be seen as it crashes to the ground, while gasps of shock can be heard from the watching crowd.",

      "According to him, Mr O'Connell worked at the Air Force for nearly three decades before moving to the Test Flying Academy of South Africa (TFASA), where he worked as chief flight instructor and was head of the test pilot school. The academy confirmed the Impala was one of its display aircraft.",

      "\"But when he turned, I could see that the aircraft was in a nose-down attitude and that concerned me. I stopped talking and I looked because I thought: 'Wow, he's low and diving down to the ground' and sadly, that's exactly what happened. And I waited and suddenly saw the flame, I never heard the impact, I was too far away but I saw this huge [flame].\"",

      "While it is too early to speculate on what exactly went wrong, he reasoned that as a \"highly qualified test pilot\", Mr O'Connell would not have attempted anything he didn't think he could manage.",
      "\"I don't think anybody would do a manoeuvre like that if you didn't know what it's about,\" he said.",

      "And while Mr Coetzee only met Mr O'Connell on the day of the fateful accident, he described him as a \"funny guy\" and \"very nice\" based on their final chat.",
      "Both men declined to comment on the Impala's track record, but Mr Emmenis said: \"It was kept in immaculate condition and when the test flight school took it, they stripped it down and checked for any faults. So there was nothing wrong with it, it was absolutely perfect.\"",

      "Outgoing Greenlandic Prime Minister Mute Egede described the plan as aggressive, and said the duo had not been invited for meetings. Meanwhile, the island's likely next leader accused the US of showing a lack of respect.",

      "When asked about the prospect of annexation, Trump said: \"I think that will happen.\"",
      "The move prompted Greenland's leading political parties to issue a joint statement to condemn the American president's \"unacceptable behaviour\".",
      "The issue took centre-stage in the recent election, during which Egede's governing Inuit Ataqatigiit party was defeated in a surprise result by Nielsen's Democratic party, which favours a gradual approach to independence from Denmark.",

      "Fatima, whose name has been changed to protect her family's identity, says one of her daughters covers her face whenever she goes out in order to hide her burns.",

      "Her toddler still has weeping wounds - his skin is taking a long time to heal.",

      "At first it seemed to work. The grandmother warmed towards Fatima's children, who were aged between two and 16 at the time.",
      "But then the burns and scars appeared.",

      "In Congo-Brazzaville the figure is 66%, in Senegal 50% and in Ghana 39%.",
      "The creams may contain corticosteroids or hydroquinone, which can be harmful if used in high quantities, and in many countries are only obtainable with a doctor's prescription.",
      "Other ingredients sometimes used are the poisonous metal, mercury, and kojic acid - a by-product from the manufacture of the Japanese alcoholic drink, sake.",
      "Dermatitis, acne and skin discolouration are possible consequences, but also inflammatory disorders, mercury poisoning and kidney damage.",

      "It is also becoming more common for women to bleach their children, like Fatima did.",
      "\"A lot of people link light skin to beauty or wealth. Women tend to shield, as they call it, their children from that discrimination by bleaching them from childbirth,\" Zainab Bashir Yau, the owner of a dermatology clinic in the capital, Abuja, tells the BBC.",

      "Some were bleached themselves as babies, she says, so are just continuing the practice.",
      "One of the most common ways to tell whether someone is using skin-whitening products in Nigeria is by the darkness of their knuckles. Other parts of people's hands or feet get lighter, but knuckles tend to remain dark.",

      "The market has a whole row of shops where thousands of these creams are sold.",
      "Some pre-mixed varieties are arranged on shelves, but customers can also select raw ingredients and ask for the cream to be mixed in front of them.",

      "Other sellers admitted using regulated ingredients such as kojic acid, hydroquinone and a powerful antioxidant, glutathione, which may cause rashes and other side-effects.",
      "I also witnessed teenage girls buying bleaching creams for themselves and in bulk so that they could sell them to their peers.",
      "One woman, who had discoloured hands, insisted that a seller add a lightening agent to a cream that was being mixed for her children, even though it was a regulated substance for adults and illegal to use on children.",
      "\"Even though my hands are discoloured, I am here to buy creams for my kids so they can be light-skinned. I believe my hands are this way just because I used the wrong one. Nothing will happen to my children,\" she said.",
      "One seller said most of his customers were buying creams to make their babies \"glow\", or to look \"radiant and shiny\".",
      "Most seemed to be unaware of the approved dosages.",
      "One salesman said he used \"a lot of kojic\" - well over the prescribed limit - if someone wanted light skin and a smaller quantity if they wanted a subtler change.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

They co-operate multilaterally, from Brics, the alliance of major developing countries, to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. They share interests in advancing non-Western economic models, countering Islamist terrorism and rejecting what they deem US moral crusading.",
      "Even after the Ladakh clash sunk ties to their lowest level in decades, the two militaries continued to hold high-level dialogues, which resulted in a deal in October to resume border patrols. Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping at a Brics summit in Russia that month and they pledged further co-operation. In January, the two sides agreed to resume direct flights.",
      "Still, the relationship remains troubled.",
      "Each side has close security ties with the other's main competitor: India with the US and China with Pakistan.",
      "China opposes Indian policies in the disputed Kashmir region. Beijing frustrates India's great power ambitions by blocking its membership in influential groupings like the Nuclear Suppliers Group and permanent membership on the UN Security Council.",
      "China has a large naval presence, and its only overseas military base, in India's broader maritime backyard.",
      "The Belt and Road Initiative, the connectivity corridor through which Beijing has expanded its footprint in India's neighbourhood, is categorically rejected by Delhi for passing through India-claimed territory.",

      "What led to Modi and Xi meeting and thaw in ties",
      "Meanwhile, India is deepening ties with Taiwan, which China views as a renegade province. It hosts the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. Beijing regards him as a dangerous separatist.",
      "India is negotiating sales of supersonic missiles to Southeast Asian states that could be used to deter Chinese provocations in the South China Sea. China views several global forums to which India belongs, such as the Indo-Pacific Quad and the Middle East Europe Economic Corridor, as attempts to counter it.",
      "There are several signposts to watch to get a better sense of the relationship's future trajectory.",
      "One is border talks. Fifty thousand squares miles of the 2,100-mile (3,380km)-long frontier - an area equal to the size of Greece - remain disputed.",
      "The situation on the border is the biggest bellwether of the relationship. The Ladakh clash shattered trust; last year's patrolling deal helped restore it. If the two sides can produce more confidence-building measures, this would bode well for relations.",
      "Future high-level engagement is also important. If Modi and Xi, both of whom place a premium on personal diplomacy, meet this year, this would bolster recent momentum in bilateral ties. They'll have opportunities on the sidelines of leaders summits for Brics in July, G20 in November and the Shanghai Co-operation Group (SCO) sometime later this year.",
      "Another key signpost is Chinese investment, which would bring critical capital to key Indian industries from manufacturing to renewables and help ease India's $85bn (\u00a365.7bn) trade deficit with China.",
      "An increase in such investments would give India a timely economic boost and China more access to the world's fastest-growing major economy. Stronger commercial co-operation would provide more incentives to keep broader tensions down.",
      "Regional and global developments are also worth watching.",
      "Four of India's neighbours - Bangladesh, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka - recently had new leaders take office who are more pro-China than their predecessors. But so far, they've sought to balance ties with Beijing and Delhi, not align with China.",
      "If this continues, Delhi's concerns about Beijing's influence in India's neighbourhood could lessen a bit. Additionally, if China were to pull back from its growing partnership with India's close friend Russia - a more likely outcome if there's an end to the war in Ukraine, which has deepened Moscow's dependence on Beijing - this could help India-China ties.",
      "The Trump factor looms large, too.",
      "US President Donald Trump, despite slapping tariffs on China, has telegraphed a desire to ease tensions with Beijing.",
      "If he does, and Delhi fears Washington may not be as committed to helping India counter China, then India would want to ensure its own ties with China are in a better place.",

      "Additionally, if Trump's impending reciprocal tariff policy hits India hard - and given the 10% average tariff differentials between the US and India, it certainly could - India will have another incentive to strengthen commercial cooperation with Beijing.",
      "India and China are Asia's two largest countries, and both view themselves as proud civilisation states.",
      "They're natural competitors. But recent positive developments in ties, coupled with the potential for bilateral progress on other fronts, could bring more stability to the relationship - and ensure Modi's conciliatory language isn't mere rhetoric.",

    "story": [
      "Saira Baloch was 15 when she stepped into a morgue for the first time.",
      "All she heard in the dimly-lit room were sobs, whispered prayers and shuffling feet. The first body she saw was a man who appeared to have been tortured.",
      "His eyes were missing, his teeth had been pulled out and there were burn marks on his chest.",
      "\"I couldn't look at the other bodies. I walked out,\" she recalled.",
      "But she was relieved. It wasn't her brother - a police officer who had been missing for nearly a year since he was arrested in 2018 in a counter-terrorism operation in Balochistan, one of Pakistan's most restive regions.",
      "Inside the morgue, others continued their desperate search, scanning rows of unclaimed corpses. Saira would soon adopt this grim routine, revisiting one morgue after another. They were all the same: tube lights flickering, the air thick with the stench of decay and antiseptic.",
      "On every visit, she hoped she would not find what she was looking for - seven years on, she still hasn't.",
      "Activists say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared by Pakistan's security forces in the last two decades - allegedly detained without due legal process, or abducted, tortured and killed in operations against a decades-old separatist insurgency.",
      "The Pakistan government denies the allegations, insisting that many of the missing have joined separatist groups or fled the country.",
      "Some return after years, traumatised and broken - but many never come back. Others are found in unmarked graves that have appeared across Balochistan, their bodies so disfigured they cannot be identified.",
      "And then there are the women across generations whose lives are being defined by waiting.",
      "Young and old, they take part in protests, their faces lined with grief, holding up fading photographs of men no longer in their lives. When the BBC met them at their homes, they offered us black tea - Sulemani chai - in chipped cups as they spoke in voices worn down by sorrow.",
      "Many of them insist their fathers, brothers and sons are innocent and have been targeted for speaking out against state policies or were taken as a form of collective punishment.",
      "Saira is one of them.",
      "She says she started going to protests after asking the police and pleading with politicians yielded no answers about her brother's whereabouts.",
      "Muhammad Asif Baloch was arrested in August 2018 along with 10 others in Nushki, a city along the border with Afghanistan. His family found out when they saw him on TV the next day, looking scared and dishevelled.",
      "Authorities said the men were \"terrorists fleeing to Afghanistan\". Muhammad's family said he was having a picnic with friends.",
      "Saira says Muhammad was her \"best friend\", funny and always cheerful - \"My mother worries that she's forgetting his smile.\"",
      "The day he went missing, Saira had aced a school exam and was excited to tell her brother, her \"biggest supporter\". Muhammad had encouraged her to attend universty in Quetta, the provincial capital.",
      "\"I didn't know back then that the first time I'd go to Quetta, it would be for a protest demanding his release,\" Saira says.",
      "Three of the men who were detained along with her brother were released in 2021, but they have not spoken about what happened.",
      "Muhammad never came home.",
      "Lonely road into barren lands",
      "The journey into Balochistan, in Pakistan's south-west, feels like you are stepping into another world.",
      "It is vast - covering about 44% of the country, the largest of Pakistan's provinces - and the land is rich with gas, coal, copper and gold. It stretches along the Arabian Sea, across the water from places like Dubai, which has risen from the sands into glittering, monied skyscrapers.",
      "But Balochistan remains stuck in time. Access to many parts is restricted for security reasons and foreign journalists are often denied access.",
      "It's also difficult to travel around. The roads are long and lonely, cutting through barren hills and desert. As the infrastructure thins out the further you travel, roads are replaced by dirt tracks created by the few vehicles that pass.",
      "Electricity is sporadic, water even scarcer. Schools and hospitals are dismal.",
      "In the markets, men sit outside mud shops waiting for customers who rarely come. Boys, who elsewhere in Pakistan may dream of a career, only talk of escape: fleeing to Karachi, to the Gulf, to anywhere that offers a way out of this slow suffocation.",
      "Balochistan became a part of Pakistan in 1948, in the upheaval that followed the partition of British India - and in spite of opposition from some influential tribal leaders, who sought an independent state.",
      "Some of the resistance turned militant and, over the years, it has been stoked by accusations that Pakistan has exploited the resource-rich region without investing in its development.",
      "Militant groups like the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), designated a terrorist group by Pakistan and other nations, have intensified their attacks: bombings, assassinations and ambushes against security forces have become more frequent.",
      "Earlier this month, the BLA hijacked a train in Bolan Pass, seizing hundreds of passengers. They demanded the release of missing people in Balochistan in return for freeing hostages.",
      "The siege lasted over 30 hours. According to authorities, 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel were killed. But conflicting figures suggest many passengers remain unaccounted for.",
      "The disappearances in the province are widely believed to be part of Islamabad's strategy to crush the insurgency - but also to suppress dissent, weaken nationalist sentiment and support for an independent Balochistan.",
      "Many of the missing are suspected members or sympathisers of Baloch nationalist groups that demand more autonomy or independence. But a significant number are ordinary people with no known political affiliations.",
      "Balochistan's Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti told the BBC that enforced disappearances are an issue but dismissed the idea that they were happening on a large scale as \"systematic propaganda\".",
      "\"Every child in Balochistan has been made to hear 'missing persons, missing persons'. But who will determine who disappeared whom?",
      "\"Self-disappearances exist too. How can I prove if someone was taken by intelligence agencies, police, FC, or anyone else or me or you?\"",
      "Pakistan's military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif recently said in a press conference that the \"state is solving the issue of missing persons in a systematic manner\".",
      "He repeated the official statistic often shared by the government - of the more than 2,900 cases of enforced disappearances reported from Balochistan since 2011, 80% had been resolved.",
      "Activists put the figure higher - at around 7,000 \u2013 but there is no single reliable source of data and no way to verify either side's claims.",
      "'Silence is not an option'",
      "Women like Jannat Bibi refuse to accept the official number.",
      "She continues to search for her son, Nazar Muhammad, who she claims was taken in 2012 while eating breakfast at a hotel.",
      "\"I went everywhere looking for him. I even went to Islamabad,\" she says. \"All I got were beatings and rejection.\"",
      "The 70-year-old lives in a small mud house on the outskirts of Quetta, not far from a symbolic graveyard dedicated to the missing.",
      "Jannat, who runs a tiny shop selling biscuits and milk cartons, often can't afford the bus fare to attend protests demanding information about the missing. But she borrows what she can so she can keep going.",
      "\"Silence is not an option,\" she says.",
      "Most of these men - including those whose families we spoke to - disappeared after 2006.",
      "That was the year a key Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti, was killed in a military operation, leading to a rise in anti-state protests and armed insurgent activities.",
      "The government cracked down in response - enforced disappearances increased, as did the number of bodies found on the streets.",
      "In 2014, mass graves of missing people were discovered in Tootak \u2013 a small town near the city of Khuzdar, where Saira lives, 275km (170 miles) south of Quetta.",
      "The bodies were disfigured beyond identification. The images from Tootak shook the country - but the horror was no stranger to people in Balochistan.",
      "Mahrang Baloch's father, a famous nationalist leader who fought for Baloch rights, had disappeared in early 2009. Abdul Gaffar Langove had worked for the Pakistani government but left the job to advocate for what he believed would be a safer Balochistan.",
      "Three years later Mahrang received a phone call that his body had been found in Lasbela district in the south of the province.",
      "\"When my father's body arrived, he was wearing the same clothes, now torn. He had been badly tortured,\" she says. For five years, she had nightmares about his final days. She visited his grave \"to convince myself that he was no longer alive and that he was not being tortured\".",
      "She hugged his grave \"hoping to feel him, but it didn't happen\".",
      "When he was arrested, Mahrang used to write him letters -  \"lots of letters and I would draw greeting cards and send them to him on Eid\". But he returned the cards, saying his prison cell was no place for such \"beautiful\" cards. He wanted her to keep them at home.",
      "\"I still miss his hugs,\" she says.",
      "After her father's death, Mahrang says, her family's world \"collapsed\".",
      "And then in 2017,  her brother was picked up by security forces, according to the family, and detained for nearly three months.",
      "\"It was terrifying. I made my mother believe that what happened to my father wouldn't happen to my brother. But it did,\" Mahrang says. \"I was scared of looking at my phone, because it might be news of my brother's body being found somewhere.\"",
      "She says her mother and she found strength in each other: \"Our tiny house was our safest place, where we would sometimes sit and cry for hours. But outside, we were two strong women who couldn't be crushed.\"",
      "It was then that Mahrang decided to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Today, the 32-year-old leads the protest movement despite death threats, legal cases and travel bans.",
      "\"We want the right to live on our own land without persecution. We want our resources, our rights. We want this rule of fear and violence to end.\"",
      "Mahrang warns that enforced disappearances fuel more resistance, rather than silence it.",
      "\"They think dumping bodies will end this. But how can anyone forget losing their loved one this way? No human can endure this.\"",
      "She demands institutional reforms, ensuring that no mother has to send her child away in fear. \"We don't want our children growing up in protest camps. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Mahrang was arrested on Saturday morning, a few weeks after her interview with the BBC.",
      "She was leading a protest in Quetta after 13 unclaimed bodies - feared to be missing persons - were buried in the city. Authorities claimed they were militants killed after the Bolan Pass train hijacking, though this could not be independently verified.",
      "Earlier Mahrang had said: \"I could be arrested anytime. But I don't fear it. This is nothing new for us.\"",
      "And even as she fights for the future she wants, a new generation is already on the streets.",
      "Masooma, 10, clutches her school bag tightly as she weaves through the crowd of protesters, her eyes scanning every face, searching for one that looks like her father's.",
      "\"Once, I saw a man and thought he was my father. I ran to him and then realised he was someone else,\" she says.",
      "\"Everyone's father comes home after work. I have never found mine.\"",
      "Masooma was just three months old when security forces allegedly took her father away during a late-night raid in Quetta.",
      "Her mother was told he would return in a few hours. He never did.",
      "Today, Masooma spends more time at protests than in the classroom. Her father's photograph is always with her, tucked safely in her school bag.",
      "Before every lesson begins, she takes it out and looks at it.",
      "\"I always wonder if my father will come home today.\"",
      "She stands outside the protest camp, chanting slogans with the others, her small frame lost in the crowd of grieving families.",
      "As the protest comes to an end she sits cross-legged on a thin mat in a quiet corner. The noise of slogans and traffic fades as she pulls out her folded letters - letters she has written but could never send.",
      "Her fingers tremble as she smooths out the creases, and in a fumbling, uncertain voice, she begins to read them.",
      "\"Dear Baba Jan, when will you come back? Whenever I eat or drink water, I miss you. Baba, where are you? I miss you so much. I am alone. Without you, I cannot sleep. I just want to meet you and see your face.\"",

      "\"You just have no control, no privacy, and it's hard,\" he said.",
      "\"You have to learn that you have to rely on other people for everything.\"",
      "The Neuralink chip looks to restore a fraction of his previous independence, by allowing him to control a computer with his mind.",

      "It's helped Neuralink attract lots of investment - as well as scrutiny over the safety and significance of what is an extremely invasive procedure.",
      "When Noland's implant was announced, experts hailed it as a \"significant milestone\", while also cautioning that it would take time to really assess - especially given Musk's adeptness at \"generating publicity for his company.\"",
      "Musk was cagey in public at the time, simply writing in a social media post: \"Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.\"",
      "In reality, Noland said, the billionaire - who he spoke to before and after his surgery - was far more optimistic.",
      "\"I think he was just as excited as I was to get started,\" he said.",
      "Nonetheless, he stresses that Neuralink is about more than its owner, and claims he does not consider it \"an Elon Musk device\".",

    "story": [
      "With stars like Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, maybe it's no wonder \"Othello\" just became the highest-grossing Broadway play ever, pulling in $2.8 million in a single week.",
      "Washington said, \"It's the most excited I've been this century. Seriously. I haven't been this excited about anything I've done as I am about this.\"",
      "That's saying something coming from Washington. Known for roles in films like \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" (both of which won him Oscars), he's been called the greatest actor of the 21st century. But be careful before you call him a \"Hollywood actor.\"",
      "\"What's the definition of a Hollywood actor?\" he said. \"Myself, I'm from Mt. Vernon, so I'm a 'Mt. Vernon actor.' I don't know what 'Hollywood' means.\"",
      "\"Somebody who's famous on film? A film actor, great success on film?\"",
      "\"I'm a stage actor who does film; it's not the other way around,\" Washington said. \"I did stage first. I learned how to act on stage, not on film. Movies are a filmmaker's medium. You shoot it, and then you're gone and they cut together and add music and do all of that. Theater is an actor's medium. The curtain goes up, nobody can help you.\"",
      "\"Othello\" is the Tony-winner's sixth Broadway show. He plays the title character, Othello, the military commander stirred into a murderous rage after his ensign, Iago, convinces him his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal plays the deceitful Iago, who seeks revenge on his longtime comrade and commander because he was passed over for a promotion.",
      "Shakespeare wrote \"Othello\" around 1604. But this production sets the play in \"the near future,\" adding modern themes like service members suffering from PTSD.",
      "Washington said, \"People, you know, they ordinarily think, 'Oh yeah, it's about jealousy. And he betrays him.' No, it's about two soldiers who trust each other with their lives.\"",
      "\"Well, then\u2026\" Gyllenhaal laughed.",
      "\"Yeah, what are you so pissed off about? What did I do to you?\" Washington laughed.",
      "\"What you know, you know!\" Gyllenhaal replied. \"But I mean, that what is shared is theirs, you know? And what is shared beyond something that they would share with others. That's what makes their bond so strong.\"",
      "At 44 years old, Gyllenhaal is widely celebrated for the emotional range and intensity he brings to roles, in films such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Zodiac\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" And like Washington, he is a theater veteran, with \"Othello\" marking his fourth appearance on Broadway. But this is his first time performing Shakespeare (almost). \"You know what I realized? I did do 'Much Ado About Nothing' in high school,\" he said. \"And I realized that this morning.\"",
      "\"You forgot?\" an astonished Washington laughed.",
      "\"Probably the audience and I would probably like to forget!\"",
      "We visited Gyllenhaal before a performance this past week at the Barrymore Theatre. Standing on stage, the actor said, \"It's my favorite place to be.\"",
      "He explained his character feeds off the audience: \"[Iago] does have a lot of moments [where] he has interactions with the audience, they kind of become his partner in it, and every night it is different. And that's what I love so much about it.\"",
      "Washington, now 70, is no stranger to Shakespeare. On stage he's played Richard III and Julius Caesar, and he has starred in movie versions of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and an adaptation of \"Macbeth.\" \u00a0He first played Othello as a student at Fordham University in New York City.",
      "Asked how he relates to the play and its language differently from when he was 22, Washington replied, \"I know a lot less now. I thought I knew everything then! I didn't really like the part, 'cause I wasn't wise enough to understand it. Now I understand it's really about a bond, you know, that these characters have. He loves not wisely, but too well.\"",
      "\"Othello\" has been staged on Broadway more than 20 times. For most of those performances, Othello was played by a white actor in blackface. That changed in 1943, when Paul Robeson gave a legendary performance in the role. The last actor to play him on Broadway was James Earl Jones, in 1982.",
      "\"James Earl Jones was my northern star when I was in college,\" said Washington. \"He was who I wanted to be. I didn't get to see his Othello, but I know it wasn't as good as my 22-year-old interpretation! But you know, it's my turn.\"",
      "And what a turn it's been. The show is already a box office hit. But record-breaking sales have driven prices sky-high; prime seats go for nearly $1,000, drawing some criticism.",
      "But audiences are showing up, and by the sound of it are enjoying themselves \u2013 as are the stars.",
      "Gyllenhaal said, \"You get to a point where you're like, 'Oh, I've worked my whole career for this, for this moment.'\"",
      "\"That's what it feels like for me, too,\" said Washington. \"I worked my whole career for this moment. This is a 48-year journey for me. It's fascinating to have been too young for the part, and some may say now too old. But 48 years of experience, so 48 years of pain and pleasure and life has informed my approach to playing the role.\"",
      "Gyllenhaal added, \"I feel tremendous gratitude. And he makes me feel it when I walk in that rehearsal room every day.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Boxer George Foreman (Jan. 10, 1949-March 21, 2025) rose up from poverty in a tough Houston neighborhood to become an Olympic gold medalist at 19, and heavyweight champion of the world twice. An uncommon man with the common touch, he also conquered success outside the ring as an advertising pitchman and star of infomercials.",
      "In 1973, at age 24, Foreman defeated Joe Frazier to become world champion. The following year, he defended his heavyweight title against Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, in one of the most touted boxing matches of all time, \"The Rumble in the Jungle.\" \"I beat him up for the first three rounds, four rounds. I think I even beat him up the sixth round, too,\" Foreman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2005. \"Then all of a sudden I hit him in the seventh round and he whispered in my ear, `That all you got, George?' Oh, that was all I had. You've heard of the rope-a-dope? Well, here's the dope!\" Ali, then the underdog, won in the eighth round by a knockout; Foreman lost the title.",
      "At the time, he was devastated. \"I was young, only 25 years old. I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over, because when you lose the championship it's not like you lost the title, you lose yourself, because it's like you're not a man anymore.\"",
      "Three years later, after another loss, Foreman had a religious experience that changed his life. He quit boxing and became an evangelist, preaching first on street corners, then in his own church. He opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center, a safe place for kids to hang out. \"For 10 years, I didn't even make a fist,\" he said. \"I didn't box, I didn't try to box, I was done with it. I was a preacher, a happy, fat preacher.\"",
      "But money problems drove him back to the ring. So, at 37, Foreman began his comeback. He was ridiculed at first \u2014 too old, too fat, too slow, they said \u2014 but he was also too strong, and in 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out the undefeated Michael Moorer. At age 45, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever.",
      "That same year, Foreman agreed to help market a kitchen grill that few were buying, in exchange for a piece of the company. In the first 15 years, Foreman said they sold 100 million of the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machines and its variations.",
      "\"When you go through the airport some time and people stop and say 'George, we love the grill!' that's greater than them telling me, 'George, you did a good job becoming the heavyweight champ of the world!'\" Foreman said.",
      "And he continued selling, not just grilling machines but also mufflers, chips, hot dogs, video games, home warranties, and a George Foreman clothing line.",
      "\"I'm driven,\" he said in 2005. \"I like the life I'm living, but I'm driven because there's so much more to obtain. I'm one of those guys who's going to have to fall out of the saddle. There's always one more star to reach for and I'm trying to.\"",
      "Married five times, Foreman had 12 children. And yes, he did name all five of his sons George. \"You got Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Kenny Norton, Ron Lyle, you let those people hit you on the head and see how many names you're going to remember \u2014 it would be confusing,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I kept it simple. I never forget a name!\"",
      "It also inspired a children's book he wrote, titled, \"Let George Do It!\""

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O'Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O'Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0dissolved the Kennedy Center's board of directors and named himself chairman. The new board includes\u00a0political allies like White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, longtime senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance and Fox News host Laura Ingraham.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 as well as Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \"worried about what the future might bring.\"",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\"Twain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\" O'Brien said. \"Twain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\"",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young's \"Rockin in the Free World.\"",
      "Barbs aimed at Trump's Kennedy Center changes",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O'Brien.",
      "\"I think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\" comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \"It's in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\"",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Conan O'Brien's comedy honored",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has rarely been particularly political.",
      "The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times.",
      "In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O'Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \"Late Night\" despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \"SNL\" skits.",
      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows.",
      "He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \"Hamilton\" and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \"All You Fascists Bound to Lose.\"",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",

      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",

      "In his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press), former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter recounts the glory days of magazine publishing, and of his stewardship of the trend-setting title for two-and-a-half decades.",
      "Among the colorful highlights Carter writes about from his career at the venerable Cond\u00e9 Nast property is the subterfuge required to protect Vanity Fair's 2015 scoop of Caitlyn Jenner's transition.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Graydon Carter on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" March 23!",
      "\"When the Going Was Good\" by Graydon Carter",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were always on the lookout for covers that would fly off the newsstands and, in years to come, go viral on the internet. Sometimes the quest took us down unexpected byways. If the unmasking of Deep Throat was the biggest journalistic scoop of my time at Vanity Fair, the biggest scoop with regard to the overall culture was our cover exclusive about Caitlyn Jenner. I remembered Jenner as an Olympic decathlete who as Bruce Jenner had appeared on Wheaties boxes\u2014once among the highest accolades an athlete could aspire to.\u00a0 Jenner was tall and still good-looking\u2014later, with a bit of help from colorists and surgeons. There had been a minor and desultory film career early on, and by the time of transition, Jenner was a stepfather getting ordered about by sundry Kardashians on their reality television show. Jenner had become a slightly tragic figure. But word began to seep out that there was going to be some dramatic news.",
      "One day I called Jane Sarkin into my office and said, \"What about Bruce Jenner?\" There were stories floating about that Jenner was going through reassignment surgery. I said, \"At some point Jenner's going to make an announcement. Why not in Vanity Fair? Why don't you see if we can get it?\" Our initial approach was turned down flat. Then Jenner switched to a public relations person Jane was friends with. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Jane had some news. Jenner was game to do it with us, she said.",
      "To get the cover and the inside pictures and the story, we went into deep-secrecy mode. As we had done with Deep Throat, we set up a special room at the office and covered the windows with kraft paper. Nothing suspicious about that! We had one key for the room, and a computer to handle traffic on a server separate from the one that handled the rest of the magazine. Only eight people in the office knew about the project. I assigned Annie Leibovitz to do the pictures and Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of Friday Night Lights, to do the story. I thought Buzz would be ideal. He could talk sports, and given that he had dabbled with a bit of cross-dressing, he could converse in the language of women's finery as well.\u00a0 Buzz made a number of trips west as Bruce began the process of transition. The plan was that Bruce would have surgery and then recuperate in isolation at his home in Malibu. Our agreement was that no one else was allowed to visit him during this period. Only Buzz. As the reporting progressed, we had issues to contend with, including finding women's clothes for a six-foot, two-inch former athlete and then smuggling the most famous photographer in the world into a house that was surrounded by paparazzi. Word had gotten out about Jenner, and there were even news helicopters circling overhead. We put security guards around the perimeter. And then we put the entire staff for the shoot in two large vans with darkened windows. Jane and Buzz were in one of them, as was Buzz's editor, Dana Brown. Later, Jane described walking in with Annie's team. \"The house looked out at a beautiful vista of Malibu. Very modest house. But a beautiful pool. You walk up the steps, and as I come up, this person is coming towards me in a silk robe with marabou feathers, and kitten heels with marabou feathers. Her legs are glistening with satin oil. The hair is down, and the hands are huge. She says to me, 'Hi, I'm Caitlyn.'\"",
      "Once we had the story and the shoot, it was time to pick the cover and figure out what to say on it. We toyed with any number of options. Finally, I just wrote the line \"Call Me Caitlyn.\" I figured that, by the time the issue hit the \u00a0newsstands, her name would be everywhere, and we wouldn't have to say much more than that. We were still in relatively primitive digital times, but we decided to make it the first cover we ever released online. No waiting around for the printing and binding and delivery trucks\u2014all constant sources of leaks. We prepared a brief description and a short video that had been filmed during the shoot. At noon on the appointed day, we released our story to the world. A dozen or so of us sat at a long borrowed conference table, watching the traffic on a big TV monitor. It started slowly and then, as the minutes clicked by, the graph arm just began to climb until it was completely vertical. I have no idea whether you can \"break\" the internet or not, but if it is possible, we surely came close.",

      "Growing up middle class, in Ottawa, he credits a mix of Canadian affability and inner strength for his enduring career at the top of the glittering world of magazines. \"Canadians are not weak,\" he said. \"We may look affable on the outside, but if you can survive playing hockey on an open rink in 30\u00b0 weather, you develop a spine.\"",
      "He tells the story of watching a super liner flitting by: \"And I could see in the light, the sort of the amber light of the window, a very attractive couple, and they were sort of dressed up having, I guess, cocktails or dinner. And I realized I wanted to be on that side of the window rather than this side I was standing on.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before that, would you have described yourself as having driving ambitions?\"",
      "\"No. I had absolutely no ambition whatsoever,\" he replied.",
      "He left college before graduating, but with a passion for magazines, and in 1978, set his sights on New York. It was summer in the city. He was not dressed for success. \"I had a Canadian tweed coat on, and it was about as thick as this chair. And I've never felt heat like this in my entire life. And I was drenched in sweat. Water was squirting out of me! So, I had the interview. But he said, 'Why don't you just sit in front of the air conditioner for a while?' So I sat there for a half an hour \u2026 trying to cool down.\"",
      "He left with a job that launched a career in the golden age of magazines, as he writes in his memoir: \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).",
      "And the timing was golden, too. In 1985, New York City was ripe for satire. \"With the invention of the investment banker, everything changed in New York,\" Carter said. \"People were showing off their money in a big way.\"",
      "He was a cofounder of Spy magazine, cheeky and fearless. Among his subjects: A real estate mogul named Donald Trump. \"I had met him a couple of years before,\" Carter said. \"I'd been assigned to do a story on him. I hung around with him for three weeks, and I wrote the story, and I did point out that he was sort of a sharpy from Queens and he was trying to make it. But I pointed out in the story that his hands appeared to be too small for his body. Well, he hated that.",
      "\"And so, at Spy we came up with funny epithets for people, and in Trump's case we called him a 'short-fingered vulgarian' every time we mentioned his name. And he hated that!\"",
      "And yes, Carter has dual citizenship \u2013 American and Canadian. I asked, \"How does that feel at this point in time?\"",
      "\"Especially in the last month or so, I feel very strongly Canadian, and very proud, and very happy that Mark Carney is the prime minister,\" Carter replied.",
      "The New York Observer was a weekly Manhattan newspaper memorable for the color of paper it was printed on, when Carter saw possibilities, leaving Spy in 1991. \"I thought, 'I can make this a thing.'\"",
      "And in a year, the Observer could be seen in the offices of major editors all over Europe (because Carter had sent them). But a visiting American publisher took note.\u00a0 \"And he comes back thinking, 'This is a huge international hit!'\" laughed Carter.",
      "S.I. Newhouse, head of the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, made Graydon Carter editor of Vanity Fair, where the going was very good indeed. \"I flew the Concord more than 60 times,\" Carter said. \"When you went to another city you had a car and driver. You had a car and driver in New York. It was very heady. But at the same time, it was all predicated on you making a successful magazine.\"",
      "Through the magazine, and his own outsized persona, Carter was often described as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture \u2014 someone making who's who, and saying what's what. He was responsible for bringing Monica Lewinsky back for a reset \u2026 revealing the identity of \"Deep Throat\" \u2026 squiring Diana, Princess of Wales in London \u2026 the worldwide exclusive worldwide introductions of Tom Cruise and his family, and of Caitlyn Jenner.",
      "But Jennifer Aniston was the all-time best-selling cover. \"You look back now, you think, 'What was all the fuss?'\" he said. \"But she had just broken up with Brad Pitt, and this is her talking about him, and crying.\"",
      "A successful magazine is something greater than sum of subscription and newsstand sales. For 31 years, Vanity Fair has been synonymous with Oscar party. Hollywood's party of the year was Graydon Carter's magic. \"It became not how to get people in, but how to keep people out,\" he said.",
      "So, what is it about parties that he is so good at? \"We had no VIP sections,\" he explained. \"Once you got in, everybody's the same. And with a party, it's about the right curation of people.\"",
      "\"Curation is very important to everything you've done,\" I said.",
      "\"If it's interesting to me, I think it might be interesting to others,\" he replied.",
      "Graydon Carter resigned from Vanity Fair in 2017 and retired to the south of France. It didn't take.",
      "His idea of retirement was to start something brand new. \"I wanted to produce something that'd be like a dispatch,\" he said.",
      "Air Mail is an email newsletter. It began six years ago, and is said to have half a million subscribers in 219 countries. Filled with thoughtful features and travel and shopping recommendations (all carefully curated, of course), Carter, at 76, is still finding ways to bring in readers.",
      "The impresario says he has \"stumbled\" a lot along the way. Asked to define \"stumble,\" Carter replied, \"Life is a bone yard of minor mistakes and fumbles.\"",
      "\"I've always felt that introductions would be far more interesting if you skipped the highlights \u2026 it's the lowlights where everything happens,\" I said.",
      "\"100%,\" said Carter. \"Successes are really boring. Failures are much more fascinating.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salvador-dali-museum-of-surrealist-art/",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:33:32 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 2,400 works by the Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, from oil paintings and prints to sculptural mashups, are featured at The Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., which also hosts immersive exhibitions celebrating the Surrealist.",
    "story": [
      "When Mike Wallace interviewed Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1958, the painter seemed to believe that he might live forever. Asked what he believed would happen to him when he died, the Surrealist replied, \"Myself not believe in my death.\"",
      "\"You will not die?\"",
      "\"No, no. Believe in general in death, but in the death of Dal\u00ed? Absolutely no, not.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed did die, in 1989. But in a way, he was right. The artist lives on at the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "The collection chronicles his career through more than 2,400 of his works, from oil paintings to sculptural mashups to fine jewelry. Inside the Dal\u00ed Dome, a \"Dal\u00ed Alive 360\" show fully immerses visitors in his art.",
      "\"Its spirit is based in Dal\u00ed's,\" said Hank Hine, the executive director of the museum. \"That is, Dal\u00ed was always trying to do things in new ways. The amazing thing about Dal\u00ed is that his impact is still felt today, not only in art, but in culture generally.\"",
      "Today, Salvador Dal\u00ed may be a household name, but his name first belonged to his parents' firstborn son. \"His parents named him after his dead brother,\" said Hine. \"That saddled him with a burden of identity that lasted all his life, and can explain a lot of his art \u2013 for instance, his double images, where you see one thing, and you see another. So, this Salvador Dal\u00ed was always wondering, 'Am I myself or am I the other?'\"",
      "Many of Dal\u00ed's works combine the real and the surreal \u2013 a juxtaposition he could pull off thanks to his training as a precise classical painter. \"He can paint like an old master; however, he wasn't content to stay there,\" said program director Kim Macuare.",
      "She said Dal\u00ed found inspiration by diving deep into the subconscious: \"He was very interested in the writings of the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. And so, when he cuts the drawers into the Venus, what's he's imagining is, 'What would happen if we could go up and open the drawers and look inside someone to see what really makes them tick?'\"",
      "As far as ticking goes, Dal\u00ed's famous painting of melting watches, \"The Persistence of Memory,\" is actually at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But his follow-up is here, hanging in a museum in a state Dal\u00ed never even visited.",
      "The artist had no connection with St. Petersburg, Florida. But what he did have were two very big fans. A wealthy Ohio couple, Eleanor and Reynolds Morse, bought a Dal\u00ed painting to celebrate their first anniversary, a purchase that kicked off a lifetime of collecting and friendship. They acquired everything from Dal\u00ed's early Cubist paintings to his later, larger religious-themed canvases.",
      "Hine said, \"They loved Dal\u00ed so much that they bought only Dal\u00ed for four decades, and were able to put together what is the preeminent collection of Dal\u00ed in the world.\"",
      "When the Morse family decided to donate their collection in the late 1970s, they were insistent that it all go to one location, but no museum stepped up. After the Wall Street Journal wrote an article (\"U.S. Art World Dillydallies Over Dal\u00eds\"), the people of St. Petersburg, Florida, said, \"Well, heck, we'll take it.\" The city made an agreement to find a building for the collection \u2013 a marine warehouse that, in 1982, opened as the Dal\u00ed Museum.",
      "In 2011, the collection moved to its current location, where the Morses' son Brad now comes to see the paintings that once covered his childhood home. \"There was not a square foot or inch even of wall space that wasn't holding a Dal\u00ed painting,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Dal\u00ed's 1956 oil painting \"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving)\" hung above Brad Morse's bed.",
      "Now, more than 300,000 visitors a year come to see the fascinating ways in which Dal\u00ed saw the world.",
      "Macuare said, \"Dal\u00ed had a really great quote, and I think it's indicative of how he saw himself and how he saw the world, and that was, 'I don't do drugs. I am drugs.' He thought that seeing as he did would absolutely change your perspective.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed was perceived as an eccentric. Especially in his later life, he was known just as much for his wild persona as he was for his art. But in death his work has gained greater critical appreciation.",
      "\"I think the height of his fame is not over,\" said Hine. \"Dal\u00ed's star is still rising in the world, largely because of what he suggested in his art about the ability to see the world in a different way, something that we really need in this world today.\"",

    "summary": "A lawyer for the two songwriters suing Mariah Carey said they will \"make a decision shortly on whether to appeal.\"",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" from other songwriters.",
      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \"disappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \"'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\"",
      "They said there was an \"overwhelming likelihood\" Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it. Stone had claimed that the song received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 Christmas season.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \"made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\"",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row. The list measures the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming. The song has broken streaming records and has been played over 2 billion times on Spotify.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",
      "Carey previously made headlines when she tried to exclusively trademark the nickname \"Queen of Christmas.\" She filed a petition for the trademark in 2021. The U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rejected the petition, as well as petitions to exclusively trademark \"Princess Christmas\" and \"QOC.\"",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary RFK Jr., with help from DOGE, is planning a restructuring with sweeping cuts expected at multiple agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said.",
      "Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms.",
      "National Institutes of Health",
      "From the workforce at the National Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year.",
      "Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both.",
      "One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration.",
      "The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicy reported in November.",
      "There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019.",
      "One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff.",
      "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",
      "Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts.",
      "Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedy denouncing reports that half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs.",
      "The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted in more than 10% of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.",

Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further.",

You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",
      "Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people\u00a0surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization\u00a0did not know these accounts existed.",
      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",
      "Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress \u2014 a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.",
      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",

Without the account, Safarik could have risked losing government assistance if he had more than $2,000 in assets saved at one time in a given month.",

      "Named for the 2014 law that created them, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, ABLE accounts have been available since 2016 to individuals identified by a doctor as having a disability before the age of 26. Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well.",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account \u2014 including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers \u2014 up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account.",
      "There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further.",
      "Awareness is the biggest challenge",
      "Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he's also the secretary treasurer.",
      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",
      "Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people\u00a0surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization\u00a0did not know these accounts existed.",
      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How do I know if I qualify for an ABLE account?",
      "Two online resources \u2014\u00a0ABLE Today\u00a0and the\u00a0ABLE National Resource Center\u00a0\u2014 can guide you through questions to determine if you or a friend or family member qualifies.",

The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.",

      "Data from Tourism Economics, a branch of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, is forecasting a 15% drop in the number of visits from Canada in 2025.",
      "International travel from all foreign countries to the U.S. is expected to drop by just over 5%, according to the report. Factoring in diminished spending by Americans traveling domestically this year, overall travel spending in the U.S. could drop up to $64 billion in 2025, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "\"The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,\" Tourism Economics said in the report. \"Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S.\""

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices has sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population.",
      "The new requirements will impact anyone who needs to verify their bank information with the agency, as well as families with children who receive Social Security benefits and cannot verify a child's information on the SSA website. They are intended to combat fraud and waste within the system, which President Trump and officials in his administration have claimed are widespread.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday that, beginning March 31, those who cannot properly verify their identity over the agency's \"my Social Security\" online service will be required to visit an agency field office in person to complete the verification process. They also announced recently that Social Security field offices across the country will be closing.",
      "Of the 47 SSA field offices listed for closure on the website for the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, 26 are slated for closure this year, with some taking effect as early as next month, according to an Associated Press analysis of the data.",
      "That change, in addition to the impending closure of field offices across the country, and a plan to reduce the agency workforce with mass layoffs, could result in massive delays to services, advocates say. Nancy LeaMond of the AARP said eliminating phone verification \"will result in more headaches and longer wait times to resolve routine customer service needs.\"",
      "Leamond, the AARP's chief advocacy and engagement officer, said the announcement \"not only comes as a total surprise but is on an impractical fast-track.\"",
      "\"SSA needs to be transparent about its service changes and seek input from the older Americans who will be affected. Because any delay in Social Security caused by this change can mean real economic hardship,\" LeaMond said.",
      "Agency leaders said Tuesday that the agency would begin training frontline employees and management about the new policy for the next two weeks.",
      "Pushback from Democrats came quickly. A group of 62 House Democrats wrote Wednesday to the agency's acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, to express concern about how the changes could hurt older beneficiaries in remote areas and people with limited internet access.",

      "The agency distributes roughly $1.6 trillion in old-age and disability benefits annually.",
      "The end of phone service identification could be dramatic for some recipients, including families with children who will be required to visit an SSA office, since children can't open online accounts through the \"my Social Security\" online service.",
      "Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, said \"this will make it far harder for the American people to claim their earned benefits. It could even cause major delays, and ultimately collapse the system, by overwhelming the field offices.\"",

      "For President Trump, the barrage of tariffs the U.S. is set\u00a0to unleash on the country's largest trading partners on April 2 amounts to \"Liberation Day,\" as he described the trade measures Thursday on social media. To the Federal Reserve, as Chair Jerome Powell relayed on Wednesday, tariffs are a broadside on economic growth.",
      "Where does that leave investors? Scratching their heads, judging by today's trading. Stocks wobbled early, rebounded and then lost momentum in the afternoon. The S&P 500 fell 12 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,663, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended largely flat and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%.",
      "The dip followed the stock market's modest bounce yesterday after the Fed announced it was standing pat on interest rates, as Wall Street had expected. Indeed, investors may not have learned much from the central bank and Powell's remarks given that economists have already begun forecasting weaker growth and higher inflation as the U.S. moves to deploy tariffs against Canada, China, Europe, Mexico and other countries.",
      "Powell's uncertainty principle",
      "Another thing investors didn't learn from the Fed: The world is a much more uncertain place today than it was before Mr. Trump was re-elected in November. Financial markets have slumped this year as the White House laid out its plans for tariffs, with the S&P 500 falling briefly into correction territory, or 10% below its previous peak. The index is now down 8.4% since reaching its all-time high on Feb. 19.",
      "Still, if there were any lingering doubts that the nation's economic outlook is murky, Powell seemed determined to squash them flat. The Fed chair cited uncertainty five times in his prepared remarks and another dozen times in the following press conference.",
      "That uncertainty refers to the questions regarding how the Trump administration's economic agenda on trade, immigration, fiscal policy and government regulation could affect the economy.",
      "For people thinking of taking out a loan, of course, what is certain is that for now the Fed prefers to assess the impact of these policies before cutting its benchmark interest rate.",
      "That caution, while understandable given the questions hanging over the economy, could itself pose risks \u2014 namely, that the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting panel, might wait too long before easing back on the stick.",
      "\"[T]he Fed's understandably cautious stance also opens the door for the Committee to be late to the party in the event the economy starts to lose more momentum, which is the higher risk in our opinion,\" TD Cowen analysts said Thursday in note to investors.",
      "There is ample precedent for the Fed mistiming its policy shifts, as it did during the pandemic when an earlier move to tighten rates might have helped head off rising inflation.",
      "To be sure, despite the haze surrounding the economy, Powell remains clear on one thing that should prove reassuring to investors: The risks of a U.S. recession remain low. And although Fed policymakers expect inflation to rise this year to 2.7%, they also think it will recede to 2.2% in 2026 and 2% in 2027.",
      "Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, thinks stocks could climb in the near term as investors focus on word from the Fed that it could still lower rates twice this year. Over the longer term, the question hovering over markets will be how the economy responds to the shock therapy administered by Mr. Trump, and whether the Fed has the medicine to address it.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

But President Trump's aggressive trade policies, which have triggered concerns about economic growth, have also amplified uncertainty for financial markets.",

      "The Federal Reserve famously hates to surprise financial markets. That's why Wall Street forecasters overwhelmingly expect the U.S. central bank to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged when the Fed announces its latest policy statement today at 2 p.m. EST.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly signaled of late that policymakers are in no hurry to lower borrowing costs\u00a0for consumers and business. His bigger challenge: How to provide a measure of certainty on the direction of monetary policy as investors try to peer through the fog of uncertainty enveloping the global economy.",
      "Stocks edged up in morning trade ahead of the Fed's decision, with the S&P 500 rising 39 points, or 0.7%, to 5,653, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5% and 1%, respectively.",
      "Perhaps the most pressing question Powell is likely to face during his press conference Wednesday will focus on the potential impact of the brewing trade war between the U.S. and the country's key trading partners. The barrage of tariffs President Trump has aimed at Canada, China, Mexico, Europe and other countries has yet to make a deep mark on the U.S. economy, but experts warn the trade measures could drive up inflation and slam growth \u2014 a toxic stew known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "Despite signs that the economy is weakening, most Wall Street economists don't expect a recession anytime soon. And in spite of market turbulence caused by Mr. Trump's tariff threats, some experts think stocks are likely to gain strength in the months to come, although not without periodic bouts of volatility.",
      "\"We continue to expect the S&P 500 to reach 6,600 by the end of the year supported by Fed easing, healthy economic and profit growth, as well as AI spending and adoption,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email on Wednesday. \"Investors should consider buying the dip in quality AI stocks, and utilize structured strategies to manage downside risks in their equity exposure.\"",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report ahead of the Fed meeting that \"markets may have recently become overly pessimistic.\" Although he doesn't expect a recession, he forecasts slower economic growth and described the economy as \"vulnerable.\"",
      "The impact of tariffs and the health of the economy will, of course, help shape the Fed's decision on interest rates, and for policymakers the task amounts to threading the needle. Easing borrowing costs sooner rather than later would shore up growth, but also boost inflation \u2014 anathema to consumers worn down by nearly three years of high prices. By contrast, waiting too long to cut rates could cause the economy to stall.",
      "Investors now think there's a good chance the Fed will lower the federal funds rate three times this year, or a total of three-quarters of a percentage point, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.",

      "Attacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk's electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. In Canada, Tesla was removed from an international auto show over safety concerns.",
      "There has been a clear uptick in Tesla attacks since President Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that is slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.",
      "In Mr. Trump's first term, his properties in New York City, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.",
      "\"Tesla is an easy target,\" said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \"They're rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Musk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.",
      "String of attacks",
      "The attacks are keeping law enforcement busy. Prosecutors in Colorado charged a suspect last month in connection with a string of attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \"Nazi cars\" spray-painted on a building. Only weeks, the same Loveland, Colorado, dealership was targeted in another attack involving an incendiary device.",
      "And federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.",
      "\"The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\" the agent wrote.",

      "An Oregon man is facing charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.",
      "Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.",
      "In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \"resist\" was also painted in red across the building's front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.",
      "\"Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\" Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \"None of those factors are lost on us.\"",
      "Meanwhile, some Tesla owners in conservative-leaning states are also facing acts of vandalism, including one Texas man whose Tesla was recently keyed while parked at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.",
      "\"I just bought it because it was an electric car,\" Dallas resident Jeff Nguyen told CBS News Texas. \"This one is pretty fun to drive. It has really just nothing to do with politics or anything like that.\"",
      "Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn't have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.",
      "More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Mr. Trump's 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.",
      "Musk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Mr. Trump's adviser.",
      "Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump's election but has since shed all those gains and this year has tumbled 44%, prompting expressions of concern from Wall Street analysts. Measures of Tesla's brand popularity also show the automaker taking a hit, while the company's sales fell in 2024 for the first since since 2015.",
      "President Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz's podcast, saying \"at least some of it is organized and paid for\" by \"left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\"",
      "\"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \"Musk Or Us\" protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \"it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\"",
      "Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle's new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \"I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy\" or \"I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\"",
      "Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla's most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.",
      "\"We're coming after you\"",
      "The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump's administration and a key donor to committees promoting Mr. Trump's political interests. Mr. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \"domestic terror,\" and he has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \"going to go through hell.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said she'd opened an investigation \"to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\"",
      "\"If you're going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we're coming after you,\" Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she called the attacks \"domestic terrorism\" and vowed to \"continue investigations that impose severe consequences.\"",
      "Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.",
      "\"It's not the type of act that I would prioritize,\" Clarke said. \"Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\"",
      "Theresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.",

      "Someone recently slapped a \"no Elon\" sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn't intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.",

      "As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.",
      "The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Goldberg told CBS News, \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday afternoon, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly classified information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",

      "In a\u00a0piece\u00a0published Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, recounted how he says he was inadvertently added to a group chat that included national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and others on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month. In the chat, Hegseth detailed the plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen shortly before the strikes took place, and other top officials weighed in, according to Goldberg.",
      "The Atlantic said it did not publish all of the messages because some of the details were too sensitive.",
      "The National Security Council acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the group chat Goldberg reported \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "Hegseth said Monday evening that \"nobody was texting war plans,\" and he slammed Goldberg as \"a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist\" who \"peddles hoaxes.\"",
      "Asked about the report, President Trump said, \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. It's going out of business. It's not much of a magazine.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor, \"This debacle requires a full investigation into how this happened, damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future. If our nation's military secrets are being peddled around over unsecure text chains, we need to know that at once. We need to put a stop to it immediately.\"",
      "He added, \"When Pete Hegseth came before the Senate as a nominee, Democrats warned that something like this might happen. These people are clearly not up for the job. We warned confirming them was dangerous, that they'd behave recklessly. Unfortunately, we were right.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who serves on the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee, slammed the incident as \"a dangerous level of incompetence\" and \"an inexcusable failure.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, called it \"a shocking breach\" and urged a \"prompt and thorough investigation\" into the matter.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News that there should \"absolutely\" be a congressional investigation \"so that we can understand what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again.\"",
      "\"This is reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous,\" the New York Democrat said. \"Who are some of these people that Donald Trump has put into the most sensitive national security positions in America? We were promised that Donald Trump was going to hire the very best. It's all phony.\"",
      "House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith called the incident \"deeply troubling.\" \"You're discussing war plans over the signal app. I mean, that's just unimaginable. There are secure lines of communication to do this, and anybody with just a rudimentary understanding of how national security works knows this. but apparently, Secretary Hegseth and Mike Waltz and the gang don't know,\" he said.",
      "House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes raised concern that the phones could have been vulnerable to hacking. \"Let's assume that the people on the Signal chat were probably the top targets for some of our global enemies. It is by the grace of God that one of those enemies didn't alert the Houthis in advance so that they could reconfigure their anti aircraft assets, and had they done that, we would be looking at dead pilots right now. That's how serious what this administration did is.\"",
      "Rep. Betty McCollum, a Democrat from Minnesota, raised the question of whether the officials violated the Espionage Act.",
      "Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Lawler of New York criticized the use of an encrypted messaging app to discuss the war plans.",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",
      "\"Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels \u2014 and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,\" Lawler wrote. \"Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, offered a defense of the conduct and said the reporting showed \"top level officials doing their job, doing it well, and executing on a plan with precision.\"",
      "\"That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters.",

    "summary": "President Trump announced Susan Monarez is to be elevated from her role as acting CDC director, after nominee David Weldon was withdrawn earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided to pick Susan Monarez to be the new nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making permanent the acting role she has served at the public health agency in recent months.",
      "Monarez would be named in place of Dr. David Weldon, a former Florida congressman whose nomination was withdrawn by the White House earlier this month over concerns that he didn't have the votes to clear the Senate confirmation process.",
      "\"As an incredible mother and dedicated public servant, Dr. Monarez understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future. Americans have lost confidence in the CDC due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement,\" the president\u00a0posted\u00a0on Truth Social, announcing the pick Monday afternoon.",
      "Monarez apparently beat out others who had been seen as contenders for the role, including former obstetrician-gynecologist and Texas congressman Michael Burgess. Weldon had also floated Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo for the role, calling for him to be at the top of Mr. Trump's list to replace him as the nominee.",
      "If confirmed, Monarez would be the first head of the CDC to be voted on by senators, under a change passed by Congress in 2022. Previous directors of the agency were able to take the reins soon after they were picked by the president, without undergoing the confirmation process.",
      "Monarez, who was previously deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, has been serving as the CDC's acting head since January.",
      "She has been viewed as an unconventional pick for the role because previous interim directors have come from within the CDC's career ranks.",
      "Past directors in recent history have also been medical doctors, while Monarez has a PhD. An acting director in the 1980s and 90s was also not a medical doctor, though he was a longtime career CDC official.",
      "According to one federal health official, White House officials have said they are trying to \"get it right\" with their new pick. Another federal official said that Monarez had gotten along well with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, since taking on the role.",
      "Monarez and her aides at the agency were in Washington, D.C., last week for meetings, one federal health official said.",
      "\"CDC needs reform. That's why I launched a Senate Republican CDC working group. I look forward to meeting Dr. Susan Monarez and learning more about her vision for the agency,\" Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate's health committee, said in a statement.",
      "People familiar with Weldon's meetings on Capitol Hill said Republicans had been frustrated with a lack of detailed priorities or familiarity with the agency's workings, as well as an unwillingness to assusage concerns that he would be perceived as anti-vaccine.",
      "Nominees to lead the National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are expected to be confirmed soon, after hearings in recent weeks.",
      "Monarez is likely to face questions over the role she's played in controversial decisions at the agency in recent months, including undermining the independence of the CDC's flagship medical research publication, abruptly delaying a meeting of the outside vaccine advisers and plans to research whether vaccines cause autism \u2014 long after its scientists had debunked the claims.",
      "A range of health threats are now facing the CDC, including a rise in measles cases driven by a record outbreak among undervaccinated communities in Texas and neighboring states.",
      "Like other nominees, Monarez will face questions over whether she agrees with condemnation by health experts of Kennedy's responses to the outbreak, like remarks downplaying the virus and inflating the risks posed by the measles vaccine. Kennedy has also faced criticism over his comments about how to handle other viruses, like the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "Monarez has also been involved in decisions over steep cuts to the agency's workforce expected in the coming days, which some managers expect could result in losing up to 30% of the CDC's staff.",

    "summary": "\"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" a judge told a government lawyer Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0 An appeals court judge said Monday that Nazis were treated better under the Alien Enemies Act than Venezuelan migrants removed from the U.S. and flown to El Salvador earlier this month.",
      "\"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" Judge Patricia Millett said, admonishing the Justice Department during oral arguments.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" said Drew Ensign, the government's attorney",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged Tren de Aragua gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison did not have the chance to appear in court.",
      "The judge said the question at hand wasn't the use of the act, but rather, the right of detainees to have due process and challenge their status as accused members of the gang.",
      "Millett, appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, said migrants may continue to be detained under the Alien Enemies Act, but they may not be deported until there is a decision on a preliminary injunction to stop the removals.",
      "\"No president has ever used this statute this way,\" Millett said. The Alien Enemies Act has only been invoked three other times \u2014 during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. It has never been used when the U.S. was not at war. She raised concerns about the act's implementation by government employees who may have removed people to El Salvador who were not Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Judge Justin Walker asked Ensign whether individual hearings were required before deportations, as D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg had written in his order Monday.",
      "Ensign responded, \"I agree with part of that.\" Walker, a Trump nominee, pressed him on how that would work.",
      "\"There are some individualized Habeas hearings being heard in Texas,\" Walker said. He asked, \"If they can bring a habeas petition and say they're not a member of [Tren de Aragua] \u2026 how would they bring that habeas claim?\"",
      "Millett, too, asked Ensign about the men who were deported to El Salvador as gang members: \"Were people on planes last weekend given the ability to file habeas?\"",
      "The government responded that yes, the five plaintiffs were able to appear in court. But the plaintiffs were not on the deportation flights that are at the center of the case, and they remain in custody in Texas.",
      "Ensign said he did not know how many migrants are being held in the U.S. under the AEA and said those who are currently held are being detained under Title 8 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Ensign argued habeas petitions to appeal detention could be filed on behalf of this class in Texas.",
      "\"When were they given notice that they were being detained as part of [Tren de Aragua]\" and how much notice was given before they were put on the plane, Millett asked.",
      "Ensign said the answers were not in the record. He told the appeals panel, \"We've agreed challenges to individual determinations can be brought.\"",
      "But Millett pressed him further, asking whether \"the government considers itself within its right to pack every member of this class on an airplane before there is a reasonable amount of time to file a habeas petition?\" Ensign did not respond immediately, but later said the statute does not require such notice \u2014 notice, that is, that they were being detained as Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorney Lee Gelernt of the ACLU claimed, \"There was no process,\" and migrants \"were designated [Tren de Aragua] without any advance notice and rushed onto planes.\" He said he would soon submit declarations reflecting this.",
      "The government also made the case before the appeals panel that it should be moved to another venue and that the president's decision to invoke the AEA was not reviewable.",
      "Ensign said the lower court's order blocking the Trump administration from deporting alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the act represented an \"enormous intrusion\" into presidential power.",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg on Monday rejected the government's motion to rescind his order regarding the administration's use of the AEA for deportations. He found the plaintiffs were likely to win on the merits of the case because they're entitled to due process and individual hearings.",
      "He also expressed doubt that Mr. Trump's use of the act for these deportations is lawful, writing, \"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion.'\"",
      "Judge Walker appeared to take the government's side about the venue where the case was brought, pointing out that the complaint, which is being heard in Washington, D.C., could have been filed in Texas, where the five original plaintiffs are in custody.",
      "Gelernt conceded the point, but argued \"this has all been done in secret,\" and it would not have enabled hearings to be held on an individual basis for all those accused of being gang members. The government has not released the names of the 238 men deported on two flights to El Salvador who are now being held in a maximum security terrorism prison, although CBS News reported their names last week.",
      "\"Absent a class [temporary restraining order], we would have had far more people sitting in a Salvadoran prison,\" Gelernt said.",
      "\"I think that's a tough precedent for you,\" Walker told Gelernt, because no suit was being brought in Texas, where the defendants were being held.",
      "\"No class member is seeking release\" Gelernt responded. \"The government is using the act to try and short-circuit immigration proceedings.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely not trying to get anybody out of detention.\" Gelernt added.",
      "\"Can you \u2014 standing here \u2014 give us an example of a district court injunction that enjoined a national security operation that survived appeal?\" Walker asked.",
      "\"The implications of not giving people a chance to contest it are extraordinary,\" Gelernt replied.",
      "\"Many \u2014 if not most \u2014 of the people removed had no connection to the gang,\" Gelernt said, asking that Judge Boasberg be allowed to continue his work. He predicted the plaintiffs would end up \"on a plane\" following the trajectory of the other alleged Venezeulan gang members if the order blocking the use of the AEA is lifted.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

    "summary": "A redistricting battle over Louisiana's congressional map has spanned years and been before the Supreme Court twice already.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with whether to leave in place Louisiana's congressional map\u00a0that was used in the 2024 elections and includes two majority-Black districts.",
      "The dispute is the latest involving claims of racial gerrymandering and the drawing of political districts to land before the high court following the recrafting of voting boundaries after the decennial census. In this case, the plaintiffs, who identify themselves as non-African American Louisiana residents, say the state relied too heavily on race when drawing a second majority-Black district for the state's congressional map.",
      "It was unclear following arguments whether the high court was inclined to preserve Louisiana's map for use in future elections. New district lines are drawn after every Census.",
      "The justices have in recent years weakened the Voting Rights Act, starting with the landmark 2013 decision that gutted the law's preclearance requirement. Before that decision, certain states and localities \u2014 mostly Southern \u2014 with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices were required to submit changes in election law to the Justice Department for approval before they could be implemented. The court ruled that the formula used by the Voting Rights Act to determine what states and localities were subject to Section 5 was unconstitutional because it was based on electoral conditions in the 1960s and 1970s, rather than on contemporary circumstances, and thus imposed unequal burdens on some states without sufficient justifying evidence.",
      "But in a surprising decision in 2023, the high court declined an invitation to reshape Section 2 of the landmark voting law and invalidated Alabama's congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers after the 2020 Census.",
      "The latest case before the court involves Louisiana's congressional map, which was redrawn last year to add a second majority-Black district to comply with Section 2, but then was found to be a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race.",
      "\"What we're looking at is the decision on how you draw districts to comply with the VRA and at the same time, not violate the 14th Amendment's ban on drawing districts based on race, where race is used excessively,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a professor at New York Law School who is an expert in redistricting.",
      "The dispute, he said, \"is a conflict of different issues coming to us at a time when the court is highly politicized.\"",
      "The case, known as Louisiana v. Callais, has ping-ponged around the federal courts, including twice at the Supreme Court, since 2022, when a federal district court in Baton Rouge issued the first decision in this long-running dispute. The judge, Shelly Dick, found the original map of Louisiana's six congressional districts that was enacted by the legislature in February 2022 likely violated Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength.",
      "That initial map from the GOP-led legislature had one majority-Black district. African-Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "The judge blocked the state from conducting congressional elections under those lines and ordered the state to put in place a remedial plan with two majority-Black House districts. A federal appeals court then upheld that injunction and set a deadline for Louisiana to draw the new voting lines.",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who took office in January 2024, called the legislature into special session to draw a new congressional map, with the understanding from state lawmakers that two of its six districts had to be majority-Black.",
      "The plan adopted reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to adhere to the district court's order and bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state officials said. But Louisiana state lawmakers said they had another goal: to protect certain Republican incumbents, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, they said.",
      "It did that at the expense of Garrett Graves, a Republican who represented District 6 and was at risk of losing his seat because of the redrawn lines. The new district has a Black voting age population of roughly 51%. It stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast, and connects predominantly Black populations from Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge.",
      "Shortly after the new redistricting plan was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged that the redrawn District 6 was a racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel in Shreveport found that the legislature predominantly considered race when it crafted the new voting lines and blocked the state from using the map in any election. But Louisiana lawmakers, along with a group of Black voters and nonprofits who challenged the original map from 2022, asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the state to use the plan for the 2024 elections.",
      "The Supreme Court granted the state and Black voters' emergency relief, and the November House elections were held using the redrawn map. Graves opted not to seek reelection, and Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, won the race for District 6. The high court agreed to take up the case in November.",
      "\"The court has faced this issue several times before,\" Wice said. \"But here we have a uniquely different case because we're looking at Louisiana trying to do three things.\"",
      "The first is to comply with the courts, the second is to draw a second minority district that would allow Black voters to elect their preferred candidate, and the third is to satisfy political demands to keep certain members of Congress in office, he said.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Louisiana officials argue that the non-Black voters who challenged the new congressional map did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing, because they failed to show how they were harmed by the alleged violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "But as to the merits of the case, the state and voters said race was not the sole factor involved in how the map was redrawn. Instead, Louisiana lawmakers said they had two criteria: that District 6 be majority-Black and that the broader congressional map protect Republican incumbents.",
      "The state said the blame for its considerations of race when drawing the new map lies with the district court, since it said the remedial redistricting plan had to have two majority-Black districts to comply with the federal voting rights law.",
      "\"Having forced the state into adopting a second majority-Black district, the federal judiciary cannot wash its hands of the matter now and point at the legislature,\" Louisiana officials said. \"If a bank robber holds a gun to a teller's head, no one would say that the teller's emptying the cash drawer was self-motivated. Just so here.\"",
      "But during the arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned how the high court is supposed to reconcile the state's acknowledgement that it took race into consideration to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act with the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "\"How do we square that with the 14th Amendment's promise that race should play no role [in our laws]?\" he asked.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts also highlighted the shape of District 6, which he said runs from one corner of the state to another, \"picking up Black populations as it goes along.\"",
      "But several of the liberal justices appeared to support Louisiana's argument that it was motivated by politics when it drew the lines of District 6, and decided to draw its own map to protect incumbent lawmakers rather than continue with litigation and risk the district court implementing its own voting lines.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan said state lawmakers had good reason to create a second majority-minor district, given the lower court's order, and implemented a map that reflected its political considerations.",
      "\"If the state can't do that, the state has no breathing room\" when drawing voting boundaries, she said.",
      "In their filings, Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court to provide a \"clear articulation\" of what voting map would survive review under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, and how states can avoid \"endless litigation\" that follows every Census moving forward.",
      "They also suggested that the Supreme Court rule that racial gerrymandering claims shouldn't be decided by the courts at all and should instead be left to the political branches. The proposal, which Louisiana officials said \"would be the best outcome for everyone,\" reflects a concurring opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas last year in a redistricting case from South Carolina.",
      "\"Drawing political districts is a task for politicians, not federal judges,\" Thomas wrote. \"There are no judicially manageable standards for resolving claims about districting, and, regardless, the Constitution commits those issues exclusively to the political branches.\"",
      "No other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and his view was not raised during the arguments. But whether any other of the other justices, namely the members of its conservative wing, come out in agreement with Thomas in this case remains an open question.",
      "Sarah Brannon, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said during a call with reporters that if at least four other justices embrace Thomas' position, it would set a bad precedent going forward.",
      "\"It would make it very difficult for civil rights groups, minority voters, to bring claims in the future to raise concerns that state legislatures are using race in a way that is intended not to help Black voters have more opportunities to elect candidates of choice, or voters of color to have opportunities to elect candidates of choice, but to essentially manipulate race in such a way that would deprive voters,\" she said.",
      "On the other side, the group of 12 non-African-American voters argued that the state set a \"racial quota\" of two majority-Black districts out of the state's six House seats.",
      "District 6, they argued in Supreme Court filings, is a \"sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district based on racial stereotypes, racially 'balkanizing' a 250-mile swath of Louisiana, from the far Northwest near Texas, down to [East Baton Rouge] near the Mississippi River's mouth.\"",
      "They also rejected the state's suggestion that the drawing of district lines be solely left to the political branches.",
      "\"The state's 'odious' stereotyping of citizens based on race (even to the 'shame' of many legislators and to Republicans' political detriment) and its tenacious efforts to freeze the gerrymander for the 2024 election show why the political process is insufficient to protect citizens against invidious discrimination,\" the voters said.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil, a lawful U.S. resident married to an American citizen, in New York on March 8. He is currently being held in Louisiana.",
      "Khalil is not facing criminal charges. The Trump administration initially argued it could deport him on foreign policy grounds and later accused him of immigration fraud.",
      "Here's what to know about the rights of green card holders:",
      "What is a green card?",
      "A green card, or a Permanent Resident Card, allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the United States. Individuals can be eligible for a green card through family, employment, refugee status and other reasons.",
      "Most green cards are valid for 10 years and then need to be renewed, similar to how U.S. citizens need to renew their passports, explained David Leopold, an immigration law expert and partner at UB Greensfelder.",
      "\"The card expires, but the residency doesn't expire,\" he said, adding if a card is \"not renewed, there could be ramifications because you have to maintain the registration, but the status itself never expires assuming the person complies with the law.\"",
      "How can a green card be revoked?",
      "There are a number of reasons why an individual could lose their green card and be deported.",
      "\"Any green card holder can be subject to deportation depending on the situation,\" Leopold said.",
      "Most cases occur because a green card holder commits a crime, including violent crimes, marriage fraud, controlled substance abuse and other offenses. If they are convicted, typically after they serve their sentence in the U.S., they would face removal proceedings that involve going before an immigration judge, Leopold said.",
      "A person can also lose their permanent resident status because of \"substantiated charges of immigration fraud in the immigration process,\" Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia Law School professor and director of the university's Immigrants' Rights Clinic, said.",
      "Mukherjee said people whose green cards are being revoked are typically given a notice to appear before an immigration judge.",
      "\"They have the opportunity to either contest why they should be allowed to keep their status or concede that their status can be taken away,\" she said. \"Lawful permanent residents can't be stripped of their status in the United States without any due process.\"",
      "The severity of the crime may affect the judge's decision. In cases of violent crimes, \"deportation becomes nearly automatic,\" Leopold said. In some cases, an individual may be able to ask a judge to cancel their deportation. The judge would have to decide whether the person's conviction is outweighed by other considerations, such as community ties, family ties or their work in the U.S., he explained, but added, \"that doesn't apply to every case.\"",
      "The procedure for how a green card holder's status could be revoked is set by the Immigration and Nationality Act, Mukherjee said.",
      "Under the act, green card holders do not need to be convicted of a crime to be deported, Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, told The Associated Press. For example, if there are reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in, or are likely to engage in, terrorist activities, they could be deported, she said.",
      "Another reason a green card holder could lose their status is if they leave the United States for too long.",
      "\"Typically if they stay out of the United States for more than a year,\" their status will be challenged when they come back, Leopold said.",
      "Green card vs. citizenship",
      "A green card holder is not a citizen. To become a naturalized citizen, they would need to apply and meet various requirements.",
      "Do green card holders have the same rights as U.S. citizens?",
      "Everyone in the United States is protected by the U.S. Constitution. This includes green card holders, visa holders and undocumented immigrants.",
      "But, unlike citizens, green card holders are susceptible to being removed if they violate their status in the U.S., Leopold said.",
      "What is the Immigration and Nationality Act?",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Act is a set of immigration law provisions enacted in 1952.",
      "The act includes numerous grounds for deportation, including a provision that says a non-citizen \"whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\"",
      "A government document filed on March 9 and obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration used this provision to argue Khalil is subject to removal from the United States.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged on March 11 that Khalil has distributed \"pro-Hamas\" flyers. Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist group that has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, is responsible for the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, said in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that the allegation he circulated pro-Hamas flyers is not true, and his attorney, Amy Greer, said in a statement his detention was illegal.",
      "\"He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent, in violation of the First Amendment,\" Greer said.",
      "Matthew Boaz, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky's J. David Rosenberg College of Law, wrote in a Lawfare article\u00a0that \"one cannot simply be stripped of their residency, even by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\"",
      "Cases alleging grounds for deportation go before a federal immigration judge, who works for the Department of Justice, \"so it's not an independent judiciary,\" Leopold said.",
      "\"The law requires that the government make its proof by clear and convincing evidence,\" which is the highest standard in civil law, but not as high as beyond a reasonable doubt, required in criminal cases, Leopold explained.",
      "The particular foreign policy provision referenced by the administration is rarely used, Leopold said, calling it \"a vestige of the Cold War.\"",
      "The administration later cited other grounds to deport Khalil in a federal court filing on March 17, accusing him of immigration fraud. The government alleges that on his green card paperwork, he did not disclose his work or involvement with UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees; the Syria office in the British embassy in Beirut; and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "Where is Mahmoud Khalil being held?",
      "Khalil was arrested in New York by federal immigration authorities. He was first brought to a detention center in New Jersey and then flown to another site in Jena, Louisiana, his lawyers said.",
      "\"Louisiana is home to several ICE detention facilities and it's fairly common for non-citizens who are facing removal proceedings to be transferred to places like Louisiana due to available detention space in that state,\" Robin Nunn, a legal analyst and trial attorney, told CBS News 24/7 on March 11.",
      "Khalil's attorneys are trying to reverse his transfer to Louisiana, calling it \"blatantly improper.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court to pause a lower court decision that required six agencies to reinstate more than 16,000 federal probationary workers who were terminated.",
      "The request for emergency relief from the Justice Department is the latest intervention the administration is seeking from the Supreme Court as it faces more than 100 lawsuits challenging President Trump's policies. Already pending before the justices is a request to narrow injunctions that blocked implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. A decision on that request isn't expected until early next month.",
      "The latest bid from the Trump administration arose out of U.S. District Judge William Alsup's order earlier this month that required six agencies \u2014 the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury \u2014 to reinstate probationary workers who were fired last month.",
      "In the challenge brought by a group of labor unions and nonprofit groups, the judge said the terminations were likely unlawful because the Office of Personnel Management did not have the authority to direct the firings.",
      "But in the request to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote that the court's preliminary injunction let third parties \"hijack the employment relationship between the federal government and its workforce.\"",
      "\"And, like many other recent orders, the court's extraordinary reinstatement order violates the separation of powers, arrogating to a single district court the Executive Branch's powers of personnel management on the flimsiest of grounds and the hastiest of timelines,\" she wrote. \"That is no way to run a government.\"",
      "Alsup's order covers roughly 16,000 federal workers who were still in probationary status, or those generally in a one- or two-year trial period. A federal appeals court declined the Trump administration's request to halt the decision, leading the Justice Department to ask the Supreme Court for relief.",
      "\"This court should not allow a single district court to erase Congress's handiwork and seize control over reviewing federal personnel decisions \u2014 much less to do so by vastly exceeding the limits on the scope of its equitable authority and ordering reinstatements en masse,\" Harris wrote.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the district court's order forces the government to embark on a \"massive administrative undertaking\" to reinstate and onboard thousands of fired employees in just a few days.",
      "The firings of probationary workers came as part of Mr. Trump's broad initiative to shrink the size of the federal government, an effort that is being undertaken by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "More than 24,000 probationary workers were removed from their positions as part of the mass firings, the Justice Department revealed in a court filings submitted in a separate case challenging the terminations, which was brought in Maryland and involves 18 agencies.",
      "The judge overseeing that case also temporarily blocked the mass firings and ordered the affected federal workers at the agencies to be reinstated.",
      "As the legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term agenda make their way through the federal courts, the president and his Republican allies have launched attacks on district court judges who have issued temporary orders blocking enforcement of the policies while proceedings move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, a senior White House adviser, have repeatedly called for some of the judges to be impeached, though it's unlikely any effort to remove them would be successful. But the president and GOP lawmakers have also condemned the relief the judges are issuing, and particularly the fact that they apply nationwide.",
      "In Supreme Court filings in the case involving Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship executive order, Harris urged the justices to rein in the use of nationwide injunctions.",
      "\"Government-by-universal-injunction has persisted long enough, and has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks,\" she wrote. \"It is long past time to restore district courts to their 'proper \u2014 and properly limited \u2014 role \u2026 in a democratic society.'\"",
      "Harris reiterated that request Monday in the dispute over the mass firings of federal workers, urging the high court to \"end the interbranch power grab.\"",
      "\"Those orders have sown chaos as the Executive Branch scrambles to meet immediate compliance deadlines by sending huge sums of government money out the door, reinstating thousands of lawfully terminated workers, undoing steps to restructure Executive Branch agencies, and more,\" she wrote. \"The lower courts should not be allowed to transform themselves into all-purpose overseers of Executive Branch hiring, firing, contracting, and policymaking.\"",

      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",

      "O'Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \"Late Night\" despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \"SNL\" skits.",
      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows.",
      "He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \"Hamilton\" and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \"All You Fascists Bound to Lose.\"",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

    "summary": "Democrats remained mum as they left Washington in the aftermath of the tense funding fight.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns Monday from a weeklong recess as the fallout continues from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's move to help Republicans advance a controversial spending bill earlier this month to avoid a government shutdown.",
      "As lawmakers left Washington following many weeks in session, a recess that Democrats initially hoped would be marked by a show of force against the Trump administration and Republican control of Washington was punctuated by handwringing over the party's direction \u2014 and questions about its leadership.",
      "Democrats remained mum as they left Washington in the aftermath of the tense funding fight. And at town halls from Colorado to California, Democrats sidestepped questions about Schumer's decision and his leadership of the upper chamber more broadly, previewing a messy return to Washington as the party contends with its divisions.",
      "Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, dodged a question about Schumer being replaced as leader last week, before pivoting to former President Joe Biden and urging that \"it's important for people to know, you know, when it's time to go.\"",
      "\"We're going to have conversations I'm sure in the foreseeable future about all the Democratic leadership,\" Bennet said at a town hall in Golden, Colorado.",
      "Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland became the first Democratic lawmaker to openly call for new Senate leadership at a town hall last week, saying that though he respects Schumer and his long tenure in Washington, \"it may be time for the Senate Democrats to pick new leadership as we move forward.\" Rep. Delia Ramirez followed suit at a town hall in Chicago last week. And progressive youth groups joined in on the criticism, urging Schumer in a letter obtained by CBS News to \"fight for us or step aside.\"",
      "Still, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who initially opted not to comment when asked whether he was confident in Schumer's leadership, weighed in with support for Schumer last week. And Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi echoed the confidence in Schumer's leadership, though she delivered a stinging rebuke.",
      "\"I myself don't give away anything for nothing,\" Pelosi said. \"And I think that's what happened the other day.\"",
      "Schumer had initially signaled that his caucus would fight back against a partisan measure to keep the government funded after the House passed the measure in a narrow vote that came as a surprise to some. But a day later, Schumer reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage.",
      "The New York Democrat has stood by his decision, while arguing that he remains the \"best leader for the Senate.\" He told \"CBS Mornings\" last week that as bad as the founding bill was, \"a shutdown is 10 times worse.\" On Sunday, he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he's not stepping down.",
      "The backlash against Schumer has come as Democrats contend with the party's direction and approach more broadly after the 2024 elections delivered bruising defeats up and down the ballot.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, shifted the blame away from Schumer, saying on CNN last week that although \"no one is in the caucus\" is more critical of the minority leader than he is, \"it's not Schumer\u2026 it's the Democratic party.\"",
      "Later in the week, Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez held a rally in Las Vegas. In an interview with CBS News at the rally, the Vermont independent said the \"Democratic party has not been the kind of party we need to represent the working class of this country in so many ways.\"",
      "\"There is no reason why we have massive income and wealth inequality, why we're the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,\" Sanders added.",
      "Across a number of town halls last week, constituents turned the focus from possible threats to Medicaid under GOP control of Washington to criticism of the Democratic Party itself.",
      "During a town hall held by Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego in Arizona last week, one constituent questioned the party's overall messaging strategy, suggesting they should get \"dirtier\" with their approach against Republicans.",
      "\"They fight dirtier and we are not willing to get in the mud with them,\" the constituent said. \"Maybe it's time we start getting a little bit dirtier with our messaging.\"",

      "Venezuela accepted the deal to guarantee the \"the return of our compatriots to their nation with the safeguard of their Human Rights,\" Rodr\u00edguez said.",
      "In his statement, Rodr\u00edguez referred to the deportation by President Trump's government of several hundred Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador.",
      "\"Migrating is not a crime and we will not rest until we achieve the return of all those who require it and until we rescue our brothers kidnapped in El Salvador,\" Rodr\u00edguez said.",
      "U.S. officials confirmed Sunday night the first flight had arrived in Venezuela, saying it carried 199 people, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The officials did not specify how many were alleged Tren de Aragua members or how their affiliations were determined.",
      "Maduro ratified the measure during a public event later in the day. \"We are resuming flights to rescue and release migrants from U.S. prisons,\" Maduro said.",
      "The Venezuelan leader also said that he held the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, responsible for the well-being of the Venezuelans deported to that country.",
      "\"You guarantee their health and, sooner rather than later, you have to hand them over and release them, because they are kidnapped,\" Maduro said.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged the deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. He labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on March 15 when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any non-citizen during wartime. A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.",
      "Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade.",
      "The Trump administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador last weekend aboard those three flights. U.S. officials have said 137 of them were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.",
      "Documents obtained by CBS News showed that at least one of the men deported, a 26-year-old barber from Venezuela, has no criminal record in the U.S., and Venezuelan officials said he has no record there either.",
      "Maduro's government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.",
      "In recent weeks, some 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
      "The Trump administration said that the Venezuelans sent to Guantanamo are members of Tren de Aragua, but offered little evidence to back this up.",

      "The termination of their work permits and deportation protections under an immigration authority known as parole will take effect in late April, 30 days after March 25, according to a notice posted by the federal government.",
      "The move will affect immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who flew to the U.S. under a Biden administration program, known as CHNV, that was designed to reduce illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border by giving would-be migrants legal migration avenues.",
      "A total of 532,000 migrants entered the U.S. under that policy, which was paused soon after President Trump took office, though it's unclear how many have been able to secure another status that will allow them to stay in the country legally.",
      "CBS News first reported in early February that the Trump administration was planning to revoke the legal status of individuals who entered the U.S. under the CHNV process.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it will seek the arrest and deportation of those subject to the policy change if they fail to depart the U.S. in the next 30 days. Officials are urging migrants to use the newly repurposed CBP Home smartphone app to register for self-deportation.",
      "But DHS said it retains the authority to target migrants who arrived under this program before the 30-day period lapses. Officials say those prioritized for arrest will include migrants who have failed to apply for another immigration benefit like asylum or a green card.",

But Republicans denounced it as an effort to circumvent the limits Congress placed on legal immigration, and noted that the program had some recorded instances of fraud.",

That prospect, however, changed dramatically when Mr. Trump took office.",

      "Last Saturday, 238 Venezuelan men were handed over to the government of El Salvador; 137 of them were deported using this rarely used 1789 Alien Enemies Act. This is important because it gives the power to detain and deport without a court hearing first if they come from countries at war with the U.S.",
      "In the hearing on Friday, it was revealed that El Salvador, where they're being held, rejected two of the people, one on the basis of gender, because it was a woman and they can't be held at a maximum-security prison, the other because the person wasn't even Venezuelan at all.",
      "How does that kind of high-consequence mistake happen?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, these kind of one-offs, we will deal with on an individual basis.",
      "But, Margaret, the underlying issue here is twofold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was a mistake that you acknowledge there?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I \u2013 I can't speak to those individual cases and the details of the individual cases.",
      "But what I can speak to is, President Trump has determined that this group is acting as a terrorist organization. It is terrorizing our communities through attacks, torture, rape and the most awful of situations for those communities, number one.",
      "And, number two, the Alien Sedition Act fully applies because we have also determined that this group is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have \u2013 I'm sorry, just to clarify on that, this is supposed to apply if the U.S. is at war with a country. You are saying you have evidence that the government of Venezuela is directing these gangs?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We are saying \u2013 we are saying \u2013 we are saying that TDA is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. This is how the Alien Sedition Act applies. And we cannot have district judges interfering with the commander in chief's actions to take care of in the way he deems necessary a terrorist organization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the U.S. is at war with Venezuela?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And I got to tell you, we can \u2013 we can debate on Article II, Article III. That's a fair debate.",
      "However, in this case, the commander in chief, President Trump, is taking decisive action to rid our communities of these gangs that are operating in a paramilitary fashion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And that we know Maduro is deliberately emptying his prisons\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 in a proxy manner to influence and attack the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's different \u2013 that's so different\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But that's how\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. is not at war with the country of Venezuela.",
      "I know the attorney general said on another network\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, this is not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 she thinks this is going to go to the Supreme Court.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Sure. That's fine. But\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to have this fight.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: No, but, Margaret, we have instances where the IRGC from Iran have operated to \u2013 by, with and through Mexican cartels, to then bomb facilities here in the United States. We have taken decisive action in that regard. We're going to take decisive action in this regard.",
      "And we're making a Washington, D.C., distinction\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 when the American people are tired of being terrorized by these gangs. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No one is defending gangs. But there is concern\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, but it sounds like it. It certainly sounds like it from the Democrats on the other side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern that this is being carried out in a sloppy way.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: It sounds like in the case of this judge that wanted to turn a flight around full of gang members that had intelligence packets that had determined what they're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was a woman sent to a men's \u2013 man's prison, and El Salvador said no.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I mean, OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's the question of, if you're suspending the ability to have a day in court\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, I can't speak to the those individual details, if you want to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you get the list right, right\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you can verify that these people are gang members.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 look, every one of them were here illegally.",
      "So, first of all, we had every right and every \u2013 and should deport every one of these individuals. If you want to make a special case for one, that's fine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they weren't deported. They were sent to the prison.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But underlying that \u2013 underlying that is the Alien Act that has determined the commander in chief has the absolute authority to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk about this more with the Homeland Security Committee chair, Rand Paul, ahead, I'm sure.",
      "I need to get to Ukraine with you because this is active diplomacy, as we mentioned. The Ukrainians accepted this U.S. cease-fire without preconditions, according to the announcement. The Russians said only holding back on energy infrastructure.",
      "What's the goal out of these talks that are about to begin in Saudi Arabia?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes, well, first, we're moving closer and we're closer to peace than we ever have been. This started with President Trump talking to both leaders back to back.",
      "We then \u2013 Secretary of State Rubio and I engaged the Russians, engaged the Ukrainians at our level, and now we have technical teams actually with Ukrainians and Russians in the same facility conducting proximity talks.",
      "And the progression will be, we have this cease-fire on aerial infrastructure. That went in place immediately after President Trump's call with President Putin this week. We are now going to talk about a Black Sea maritime cease-fire, so that both sides can move grain, fuel and start conducting trade again in the Black Sea.",
      "And then we will talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines. And that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are, and then, of course, the broader and permanent peace, which will be some type of discussion of territory for permanent peace and a lasting peace, what the Ukrainians tend to talk about or have talked about as security guarantees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things the president has said he wants to see is the return of these Ukrainian children who were abducted as part of a state program\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 by Russia to Russify them, take them from their families and move them into Russia.",
      "Why did the State Department cut off funding to one of the programs that helps find these kids? It's a Yale University program. And they said \u2013 the money was cut off. There are senators, including Grassley and Tillis, who want to know why. Do you know why?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, Secretary Rubio is conducting a review of all of those programs. I can't speak to that specific one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it seems at odds with the goal.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But I can say that President Trump has spoken to both leaders about prisoner exchanges. Both the Russians and Ukrainians exchanged prisoners, nearly 200, immediately following their call.",
      "And he's also talked about the future of these children. So that's certainly first and foremost in kind of confidence-building measures.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But, again, Margaret, we have to take a step back. We have to take a step back.",
      "Just a few months ago, no one was talking about how this war would end. And we have to ask ourselves, what would it look like a year from now, two years from now, three years from now?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We were in an endless stalemate here. And now we have both sides in the same facility with the United States really living out, I think, in real time President Trump's vision to end this war, which he campaigned on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be clear, are you asking for the release of these children as a confidence-building measure? Is that what you meant?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We're talking through a number of confidence-building measures. That's one of them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Thank you, Mike Waltz.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Thank you. All right.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee. And he joins us this morning from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "Because\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "Because of your role in on Homeland Security, I want to follow up where we left off with National Security Adviser Waltz. There are legal questions around using these authorities to send out detainees without giving them a day in court, but there's also just questions of how it's being handled in regard to these individuals who were rejected by El Salvador, one for gender, one because they weren't Venezuelan at all.",
      "Do these concern \u2013 does any of this concern you, along with claims from their family members that many of these people weren't gang members?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, there are some big legal questions here.",
      "On the one hand, the Bill of Rights applies to everyone, to persons. The Bill of Rights doesn't specifically designate citizens. It's really anyone in the United States the Bill of Rights applies to. On the other hand, the Alien Enemies Act simply says, you really don't get much process. The president can simply declare that you are somehow a problem for foreign policy and opposed to our foreign policy and you can be deported.",
      "So, really, ultimately, this goes to the court, and then the court's going to have to decide, are they going to declare unconstitutional a law that's been around for a couple hundred years or are they going to defer to Congress?",
      "If you look at the TikTok decision recently, which I don't agree with, but in the TikTok decision, the court basically said, we're going to defer to Congress. Congress says this is about national security, and who are we to question? And I think they should have ruled based on\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, and then the president issued an executive order that defied the congressional \u2013 what Congress did.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes. Right. Right.",
      "But my point is, is, I think the court should have ruled on the First Amendment with regard to TikTok and not said, oh, well, whatever Congress wants. But if you look at the TikTok decision and you had to guess what the Supreme County is going to do, my guess is, they will uphold the Alien Enemies Act. It's not necessarily my position, but I think the court will uphold it.",
      "So it's at least debatable on both sides who's right or who's wrong here. And I think it's not correct for Democrats to simply say\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 oh, it's constitutional chaos, there's no leg to stand on. There actually is legal authority on the one hand that's been around for over 200 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But just \u2013 we're not talking about partisan politics. We're talking about the courts right now and what the judge said he had questions about and talks about this being done essentially in the cover of night. This seems to be an argument the administration wants to have go to the Supreme Court.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with bypassing what you described as, you know, what's guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, a day in court, or at least some verification that some of these people actually are guilty in some way of what they're accused of, which is membership in a gang?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So we have a contradiction. We basically have the Constitution that says everyone, persons in the United States have due process rights, have the Bill of Rights on their side.",
      "But we also have law that has been in power for 200 years saying, oh, well, except when the president wants to deport people. So, these are in conflict. There will have to be some decision-making.",
      "On the question of whether or not a district judge can make a ruling for the whole country, that's also a very big question. And I suspect, as this works its way up to the Supreme Court, when you get to the Supreme Court, I do believe the Supreme Court is going to limit district judges from having nationwide rulings.",
      "So I think that's also in the offing. But these are huge legal questions. And the only way they begin is by a challenge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: If the president doesn't challenge these, they never have standing and never get to court. So, on the one hand, the president is generating this, but it's the only way to generate a final conclusion from the court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It just sounds \u2013 I mean, these are debates for law professors, certainly. But, in the meantime, there are individuals who may have been sent wrongly to these facilities that are outside the U.S. jurisdiction.",
      "Are you comfortable, as the man with oversight as chair of the committee, with what's being done?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the courts will rule that there has to be some process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, you're comfortable with it?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think you're going to be able to deport people \u2013 so, no, I \u2013 well, I don't think \u2013 you're answering for me.",
      "I think there is going to be some process afforded by the courts for representation before you're deported in most cases. I don't know about the ones under the Alien Enemies Act, and I'm not sure anybody knows that. And, while I love constitutional law, I'm not a constitutional lawyer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I do think it goes to the Supreme Court, and there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "I want to ask you about some congressional business. I have seen it reported that you have pitched to Elon Musk a plan to claw back $500 billion in federal funding that Congress has already approved. There was an effort back in 2018 to do something like this, and it failed.",
      "Do you think you can actually get this done in a rescission package, and how much money do you think you can get back?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, this goes to another huge legal question. Can the president impound money, or does he have to send it back, and we approve the cuts through rescission?",
      "And this is going all the way to the Supreme Court also, because I think the Trump administration believes they can just not spend it. There's another question within the question, can the president and his people \u2013 can Secretary Rubio pause the spending?",
      "On that issue, I think they will win. You will be able to pause spending as long as you don't go through the end of an appropriations year. If you get through that, I believe it's impoundment. And I think the courts so far have said it has to come back\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 unless, as the Trump administration argues, that the Impoundment Act is unconstitutional.",
      "So this one's headed to the Supreme Court also. It is my personal belief we should adhere to the law as it is now, and that is send it back and have Congress confirm it. It's a simple majority vote. It's called rescission. I did mention this to Elon Musk.",
      "He seemed enthusiastic it can be done. No Democrats \u2013 you have to realize\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 no Democrat will cut one penny from any spending anywhere.",
      "But can we get all the Republicans is the real question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can get 51 Republicans, you think, to get on board with this?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think the president is going to have \u2013 the president is going to have to use effectively his bully pulpit and his popularity to convince all Republicans to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's not a given that Republicans will stand \u2013 will vote for this.",
      "We tried it once in the first administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, I remember.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It was only $15 billion. And we lost. We lost two Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two Republicans.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But my suggestion to the Trump \u2013 my suggestion to the Trump administration is, come to the Republicans who you suspect might have misgivings and convince them in advance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Don't put it in their lap. Bring them $500 billion. And if they say, this $10 billion, I can't deal with, I can deal with the 490, you're going to have to pre-negotiate the rescissions package.",
      "But I think you could get there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Department of Education.",
      "States, as everyone, I think, knows, provide the majority of the funding and oversight for your local schools. But Kentucky, when we looked at the numbers, gets the fourth most federal education funding per student of any state in this country. You have over 900 schools that have these Title I programs, which are low-income schools who need that federal subsidy to continue to operate.",
      "How are schools going to get that money if the president closes the Education Department?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the bigger question, if we're sending all this money to Kentucky and all the other states, why are our scores abysmal? Why do two-thirds of the kids not read at proficiency? Why do two-thirds of the kids or more not have math proficiency?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that up to the state?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, it's been an utter failure. What I'd like to \u2013 let me finish.",
      "I'd leave it back to the states. It has always been a position, a very mainstream Republican position, to have control of the schools by the states, send the money back to the states, or, better yet, never take it from the states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: About half of our budget in Kentucky goes to education, and that's the same in a lot of states.",
      "I think we can handle it much better. When I talk to teachers, they chafe at the national mandates on testing, they think are not appropriate for their kids. They think they waste too much time teaching to national testing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: The teachers would like more autonomy, and I think the teachers deserve more autonomy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we looked at the budget in Kentucky, the state receives $2 billion in federal education funding. Do you have a guarantee that the federal government, federal taxpayers will still provide $2 billion in education funding? That seems important to your state.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I'd rather \u2013 well, no, I'd rather is a guarantee that my kids can read and write and do math.",
      "The amount of dollars \u2013 look, the number of dollars has gone up exponentially and our scores have gone the other way. So dollars are not proportional to educational success. What I want is success. And I have talked a lot about this. I think there are innovations we can do where there's more learning via some of the best teachers and we pay them more.",
      "I would like to have an NBA or NFL of teachers, the most extraordinary teachers, teach the entire country, if not the entire world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who would run that, the Education Department?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And some of them \u2013 no, what you would find is, they'd be selected out state by state, across the nation.",
      "Look, people say, oh, without the Department of Education, we would have no testing. I was in school before then. We did achievement tests in the sixth grade, the fifth grade, the eighth grade, and we compared ourselves across state lines. There were international testing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You don't need the Department of Education for any of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But what I can tell you is, the best teacher in the world is not teaching the kids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: What we need to do is have the best teachers and pay them more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But they wouldn't teach 30 kids. They might teach 10 million kids at a time because it would be presented through the Internet, with local teachers reinforcing the lessons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Well, I'm sure we will be talking more about this. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with the top Democrat in the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us this morning from Greenwich.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "I want to jump right into it on the conversation about this Venezuelan gang. You have said some of your fellow Democrats have been too quick to use the term constitutional crisis. But because of the use of the Alien Enemies Act and this gang, you have started to become concerned that's where we are. Can you explain that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): Yes, that's right, Margaret, and thanks for having me.",
      "You know, constitutional crisis is a - a sort of broadly used term. Lots of people have different definitions for it. It's a lot of stuff you don't like.",
      "I'll tell you what I know is a constitutional crisis. If the president of the United States decides to ignore the orders of a court - we have not seen that since Andrew Jackson did that in 1834. When that happens, you have a supine on its back Congress of the United States, completely beholden to the president, not acting as a check. And if the president says, I don't care what the court - courts say, which, by the way, he has not said, but which Tom Homan, his czar for deportation has said, now you have a full-blown constitutional crisis.",
      "So, I think these next couple of days, as we see how this administration goes after the many judges and the many courts - many of these judges appointed by Republican presidents who are stopping the wild and illegal actions of this administration, we're going to see whether we are in a true, you know, Jacksonian constitutional crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of your role on the Intelligence Committee, I know you have some visibility into the assessments of U.S. intelligence. \"The New York Times\" reported that the intelligence community said, with moderate confidence, that the gang, TDA, that we've been talking about, is not directed by the Venezuelan government. However, the national security advisor just told us on this program, TDA is acting as a proxy of the Venezuelan government. Why does that distinction matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, well, it doesn't matter. And I'll come back around to that.",
      "But look, what - what - what people worry about is that this administration acts with an unbelievable kind of cocktail of incompetence and illegality. When you fire all of the people at the Department of Energy who look after our nuclear weapons and then say, oops, we need to hire you back, that's incompetence.",
      "I listened to Mike. Mike is a friend of mine. I have respect for Mike. But what he did was dodge your question. I'm not a lawyer, but I can read the first paragraph of the Aliens Enemy Act, which says very clearly that the authority that this administration claims is dependent on a declaration of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Not on acting as a proxy. So, Mike distorted the law. And, you know, I read \"The New York Times\" article, too. I haven't seen specific intelligence about whether there's any connection whatsoever between Venezuela and the TDA gang.",
      "But you're right, \"The New York Times\" - and, by the way, I'll get an answer on this tomorrow and I'm going to have some questions for Mike. \"The New York Times,\" of course, reported that there's - that the intelligence community believes that there's not a meaningful connection between Venezuela and the TDA gang. So, again, it's a bizarre combination of acting incompetently because maybe there's a Venezuelan hairdresser, a gay Venezuelan hairdresser with no connection to TDA. And if he's in this country illegally, fine, deport him. But to do it in this way under authorities that are not legal is not the way to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "You're - you're referring there to some reporting in \"Time\" magazine about what happened to some of these - one particular detainee. On Friday, the Justice Department announced a criminal investigation into what they described as the leak of classified intelligence about this group, TDA. The deputy attorney general said they won't \"tolerate politically motivated efforts by the deep state to undercut President Trump's agenda by leaking false information\" to \"The New York Times.\"",
      "Do you have any concern - or is there concern within the intelligence community about these leaks?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: There's always concerns about leaks, Margaret. As ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, I don't care who a leak benefits. Whether it benefits Joe Biden or Donald Trump or whatever, they are not OK. They are violations of the law.",
      "It's very interesting though that characterization that you just read, that we will not tolerate leaks that are inconsistent with President Trump's agenda. And this gets at one of my worst fears with respect to the national security operates under Donald Trump. Everything is about Donald Trump, right? And where I work, inside and overseeing the intelligence community, it is absolutely essential that the intelligence community be about one thing and one thing only, which is giving Donald Trump and other national leaders unvarnished, unbiased advise. And if this is all about serving the president's agenda, that is a notion that is completely at odds with what the intelligence community and what we spend $90 billion on making sure that policymakers, the president chief amongst them, has good information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was listening to a town hall that you did this past Thursday in Connecticut, and you were asked who the leader of the Democratic Party is. You threw out some of the sort of known entities, governors out there, but you said, \"while the party's not leaderless, Hakeem Jeffries is young and untested and Leader Schumer is not a wartime president.\"",
      "Do you think that your party can afford to stay the course with the existing leadership they have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, I think we can do a lot better job with the leadership that we had. What I was acknowledging in the town hall meeting - and I will tell you, I've seen a lot of town hall meetings. I saw Chuck Grassley's town hall meeting. I saw my colleagues from Wyoming - ruby red Wyoming's time in the barrel.",
      "And people are outraged. They're outraged mainly, by the way, because they're coming to understand what Medicaid cuts are going to look like for them, what it means to obliterate programs that so much of the country - 70 million people in the case of Medicaid - rely on. So, there's an immense amount of anger.",
      "What I do know is that it was not a good look for the two congressional Democratic leaders to be on opposite sides of the continuing resolution. That created a great deal of adjita (ph) out there, and legitimately so. So, I am quite certain that Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer have learned from this experience and are going to, at a minimum, be unified going forward here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see.",
      "Congressman Jim Himes, we'll be watching you and that worldwide threat briefing that will be happening this coming week.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to America's health care system and former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's also a board member at Pfizer.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, measles is now in 18 states, as I understand it. Mostly Texas and New Mexico. But we have seen a growing number of infections, particularly in children.",
      "What do parents need to know and are adults protected?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Adults who have been vaccinated should be protected. This vaccine provides durable immunity. And there's no recommendation that anyone who's already been vaccinated, had the full schedule of two doses of vaccine when they were children, would need to get another booster. But if people are concerned, they can check their titers (ph). The only recommendation that CDC makes is people who are taking care of those with measles, perhaps health care workers, might consider an additional booster later in life.",
      "The bigger challenge is with children. So, children get vaccinated, as you know, at one year, and then again when they're entering school at around age four. There's a window where children probably don't have a lot of immunity. So, a child born, has some immunity passed from their mom up until about six months. But there's a window between six and 12 months where they are largely unprotected. Typically, we don't vaccinate at six months because babies don't have developed immune systems where they can develop a durable immunity from an immunization like this. But there's some recommendations now that children, between the ages of six and 12 months, might get a first dose of vaccine. They would still require a second dose at age one and a third dose at age four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw the former CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, was talking about that this past week.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The current secretary of HHS, Secretary Kennedy, has said he wants anyone who desires the vaccine MMR to be able to get one. But he also describes himself as a, quote, \"freedom of choice person.\" I want to get your analysis of what seemed to be a suggested alternative treatment.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (HHS Secretary): They are getting very, very good results they report from Budesonide (ph), which is a steroid. It's a 30- year-old steroid. And they're - and erythromycin (ph) and also cod liver oil, which has high - high concentrations of vitamin a and vitamin d. And they are seeing what they describe as almost miraculous, instantaneous recovery from that.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are those viable alternatives?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: They're not viable alternatives to vaccination. And I'd much prefer if he made a full-throated recommendation to parents to get kids vaccinated, especially in a setting of the regions where there's virus now spreading. He's talking about steroids and antibiotics. Those will use in the setting of a child who has developed pneumonitis, who's hospitalized, has respiratory distress. And so you might dose them with antibiotics to prevent secondary infections. And steroids can reduce some of the inflammation in the lungs. The hope is children don't get into that kind of distressed situation because they've been vaccinated.",
      "As far as vitamin a is concerned, there's really scant evidence that it's effective in this setting. It's used in the setting of malnourished children where it might provide some benefit. But I think talking about those kinds of therapeutics in this context creates a false impression that there's treatments available for measles when, in fact, there's not. The only way to prevent measles and prevent the sequelic (ph) from measles is to get vaccinated.",
      "You know, it's the same way people may consider whether or not they choose to get vaccinated for influenza, for the flu. Some people might make a decision not to get vaccinated because they know therapeutics are available. I certainly would recommend that - that they do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think everyone should get vaccinated for influenza. But some people might make that choice. There is no choice in this setting. There's nothing effective at mitigating the effects of measles once you get it. So, the only way to do that is to get vaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the CDC website describes vitamin a as supportive care, but vaccination the best defense. So, thank you for explaining that.",
      "There's no CDC director right now. The administration had to pull their nominee, as you know, because they couldn't get enough votes. Alex Tin (ph) here at CBS is reporting Florida's surgeon general and a former Texas congressman, Michael Burgess, are both being floated for the job. How important is it to get someone confirmed and in the role quickly?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I think it's very important, especially when you see what's going on around the country with this measles outbreak in west Texas. We may have more measles cases this year than we've had in 25 years. And so having leadership at the CDC that can direct that response is exceedingly important.",
      "Mike Burgess ran the health subcommittee on energy and commerce, worked closely with the FDA when I was there. He was very good, very effective. He did a lot - a lot to advance our interdiction work in mail facilities to stop opioids from flowing through those facilities. He was very dedicated to that effort. Actually visited the mail facility in New York at JFK Airport to see firsthand the operation before he led a charge in Congress to help provide more funding to get more inspectors into the facilities. He has a lot of experience in a lot of the areas where CDC has a very relevant mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they'll have to face a potential vote once the president makes a selection here.",
      "I want to ask about some of the byproducts and some of them deliberate cuts from the president's so-called belt-tightening here. There have been impacts at, for example, Johns Hopkins, an institute that does medical research and receives USAID grants. There are also deliberate cuts that have been vowed at Columbia and UPenn, two universities that get federal funding and do health research. Do you have any insight into how many health programs or the significance of the health programs that will be affected?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I don't think anyone has insight into it yet. I think this is still playing out. These impacts are happening across a couple of different domains. There is restrictions on the ability to go forward with new grants because of limitations, for example, posting things in the federal register. There's new grant making policies that are being implemented. So, certain entities, certain countries are being added to lists where you can't do research. There were recently some grants canceled that coincided with research that would be done in conjunction with China. They're terminating certain grants on the basis of policy considerations, like whether or not they have a certain DEI component and however they are defining that.",
      "And then you see the institutional wide cuts. I think that's what happened to Johns Hopkins with respect to the USAID cuts. It's also what happened to Columbia with respect to that $400 million cut - federal cut that impacted a lot of research. There's - so there's multiple domains where they're being impacted right now. This is - this isn't all DOGE led.",
      "I think we need to be very careful when it comes to research programs where patients are involved.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know, if you make a mistake with a program like a website that you took down, you can always put it back up. But when you cut a grant to a program where patients are involved, where continuity of care is really important to those patients, you need to make accommodation for that, or not make those cuts in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I do know - I've had some conversations - I think DOGE is aware of that and trying to be mindful of those impacts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, it's a - it's an important point to be strategic when it comes to medical care.",
      "Dr. Gottlieb, thank you for your insight.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to the Venezuelan deportation case. And for what's next, we're joined by our Justice Department correspondent, Scott Macfarlane and our immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez.",
      "It's good to have you both here.",
      "Camilo, you did some extraordinary reporting this week and obtained the names of the migrants who were sent to El Salvador. That's information that the administration refused to share with a federal judge, but you got it.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you learn?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: We're still investigating every single case on this list of 238 Venezuelan men who were sent to El Salvador to be imprisoned there, but this is what we know. We know that according to court filings and also our own findings here at CBS News, some of the people on this list do have criminal histories in the U.S. or abroad in countries like Peru, Chile and Columbia. But we also know that, according to the government, many of these people do not have any criminal record in the U.S. And we have received documents from lawyers and attorneys and also the family members of the deportees who say that these people, some of them, do not have any criminal history in the U.S. But the administration is accusing all of them of being part of this transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua.",
      "But how that accusation is being made is at the center of this story. The administration says they have U.S. intelligence and other techniques to identify these people as suspected TDA members, but their relatives and their lawyers say that some of these men were identified as TDA simply because of tattoos.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is really where we get to the legal nub of the argument is, can you, as - as Senator Paul was saying, bypass the right to a day in court on the basis of someone having some tattoos?",
      "So, Scott, the Trump administration is going to have this appeal tomorrow, as I understand it. You were in federal court Friday when the judge said it was, quote, awfully frightening how the administration stretched the law. They are looking for this fight. Why?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: There's two different fights they're looking for. The legal is one of them. They are going to be in the appeals court tomorrow. They'll go to the Supreme Court potentially eventually, trying to consolidate power to make it an 18th century reality right now where you can expel people who are locked up currently on U.S. soil without having to go through the courts, even though the courts are trying to catch mistakes and make sure nobody's scooped upper erroneously.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though you could deport them anyhow?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: You can still deport them anyhow. That's one fight they're looking to fight.",
      "There's also the political one, Margaret. There is so much political upside",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: To all of this for the Trump administration. And you heard that from the national security advisor a few moments ago when he told you this is a D.C. distinction. That the administration is not exactly concerned about looking too aggressive in deporting suspected gang members. There's all kinds of wins there.",
      "And then there's the other one, Margaret. The villainization of Washington, D.C., federal judges, which can galvanize the conservative base and the Trump base. And you saw that Friday in the courtroom with the judge, James Boesberg, pushing back on the president's allegations that he just wants to set these gang members free. The judge said, they are still locked up. You can deport them the normal way without invoking this 18th century law. Let's see how much more pushback there is from the president to the judge. There was more overnight on Truth Social.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're - yes, he's spoken about it. He's posted about this judge, raising other concerns.",
      "Camilo, though, you actually have reported out what was done behind the scenes to bring this all to a head, to set up this fight. What did you learn?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: What I can tell you is that based on conversations with DHS sources, the administration was actively preparing for this operation well before the president actually signed this proclamation, unbeknownst to the public last Friday before the White House actually published the actual proclamation on Saturday, March 15th and before those planes took off -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning do it as quickly as possible?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. They staged a roundup across the country of suspected TDA members and transferred those people to a Texas detention center. And by the time the judge held the first emergency hearing on this case, there were already two planes in the air and another one ready to take off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Knowing that they might have to face a fight back in the courts.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, the president has issued at least three executive orders that we have clocked impacting private law firms who represented clients at odds with President - or then Mr. Trump. That's bad for private business. One of those law firms cut a deal, $40 million. What's the impact here?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I talked to one of the lawyers who's been targeted by one of these actions. He says, they're trying to take me off the playing field. They're trying to take others off the playing field as we continue to challenge the administration in course. A chilling affect to make it harder to file these lawsuits that have been the firewall so far on the Trump administration.",
      "But there's a distinction in the latest round of actions prohibiting these law firms based in Washington from doing business in government buildings or with government employees. That is a death sentence for a Washington, D.C. law firm. And, in fact, one of those firms, Perkins Coie, the ones challenging this in court, said as much to the judge, this would kill us. And the judge here in Washington has, for now, held off on the Trump executive action to strip Perkins Coie. But we'll see how long that protection lasts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this has knock=on affects for others seeking legal services but also, as you said, makes them hard to just function.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Especially the stripping of security clearances, Margaret. That makes it harder for a whistleblower at the FBI, or the CIA, or the Pentagon to find a lawyer to blow the whistle. It makes it possible such whistles will not be blown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they need to seek counsel who have ability to deal with classified information.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Camilo, the administration announced Friday they're revoking legal status of half a million migrants who came here legally from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela during President Biden's term. This is another fight they wanted to have. But if the intention - the stated intention is to go after the worst of the worst and deport them, why focus on people who bothered to be here legally?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Well, the administration would argue that the Biden administration abused its immigration executive authority to create this program without Congress and that the people who came here under this policy are undercutting American workers and that they are essentially illegal immigrants as well. And now they are turning them into illegal immigrants by stripping them of their legal status, their work permits, their deportations protection. Right now they have, for the next 30 days, a chance to self-deport through a smartphone app. If they don't do that, DHS is warning that they will be found, arrested and deported from the country.",
      "And this crackdown on immigration by the administration is also extending to other parts of the immigration system. We also know that the administration is suspending funding \u2013 federal funding for legal services providers and lawyers to help - who help migrant children, who have left federal custody, or who are still in federal custody and who are facing deportation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is all intentional, the taking funding away, even from migrant kids?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes, this administration does not believe that federal funds should be used for people who are in the country illegally or without legal permission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, you're going to be busy. Thank you for breaking it all down for us. I appreciate it.",
      "MACFARLANE: Thank you.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, and he joins us this morning from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, because of your role in Homeland Security, I want to follow up where we left off with National Security Adviser Waltz. There are legal questions around using these authorities to send out detainees without giving them a day in court. But there's also just questions of how it's being handled in regard to these individuals who were rejected by El Salvador, one for gender, one because they weren't Venezuelan at all. Do these concern- does any of this concern you? Along with claims from their family members that many of these people weren't gang members?",
      "SEN. PAUL: There are some big legal questions here. On the one hand, the Bill of Rights applies to everyone, to persons. The Bill of Rights doesn't specifically designate citizens. It's really anyone in the United States the Bill of Rights applies to. On the other hand, the Alien and Enemies Act simply says, you really don't get much process. The president can simply declare that you are somehow a problem for foreign policy and opposed to our foreign policy, and you can be deported. So really, ultimately, this goes to the court, and then the court is going to have to decide, are they going to declare unconstitutional a law that's been around for a couple hundred years, or are they going to defer to Congress? If you look at the TikTok decision recently, which I don't agree with, but in the TikTok decision, the court basically said we're going to defer to Congress. Congress says this is about national security, and who are we to question Congress--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Right and then the president issued executive order that defied the- what Congress did--",
      "SEN. PAUL: Right, right. But my- my point is- is I think the court should have ruled on the First Amendment with regard to TikTok and not said, oh, well, whatever Congress wants. But if you look at the TikTok decision, and you had to guess what the Supreme Court is going to do, my guess is they'll uphold the Alien and Enemies Act. It's not necessarily my position, but I think the court will uphold it. So it's at least debatable on both sides, who's right or who's wrong here. And I think it's not correct for Democrats to simply say, oh, it's constitutional chaos. There's no leg to stand on. There actually is legal authority. On the one hand, it's been around for over 200 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, but just- we're not talking about partisan politics. We're talking about the courts right now. And what the judge said he had questions about and talks about this being done, you know, essentially in the cover of night, this seems to be an argument the administration wants to have go to the Supreme Court. Are you comfortable with bypassing what you described as, you know, what's guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, a day in court, or at least some verification that some of these people actually are guilty in some way of what they're accused of, which is membership in a gang?",
      "SEN. PAUL: So we have a contradiction. We basically have the Constitution that says everyone, persons in the United States have due process rights, have the Bill of Rights on their side, but we also have law that has been in power for 200 years saying, oh, well, except for when the president wants to deport people. So these are in conflict. There will have to be some decision making. On the question of whether or not a district judge can make a ruling for the whole country, that's also a very big question, and I suspect, as this works its way up to the Supreme Court, when you get to the Supreme Court, I do believe the Supreme Court is going to limit district judges from having nationwide rulings. So I think that's also in the offing. But these are huge legal questions, and the only way they begin is by a challenge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah",
      "SEN. PAUL: If the president doesn't challenge these, they never have standing and never get to court. So on the one hand, the president is generating this, but it's the only way to generate a final conclusion from the court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It just sound- I mean- these are debates for law professors, certainly, but in the meantime, there are individuals who may have been sent wrongly to these facilities that are outside the U.S. jurisdiction. Are you comfortable as the man with oversight, as chair of the committee, with what's being done?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think the courts will rule that there has to be some process. I don't think you are going to be able to deport people--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, you are comfortable with it?",
      "SEN. PAUL: So no, I- well, I think you're answering for me. I think there is going to be some process afforded by the courts for representation before you're deported in most cases. I don't know about the ones under the Alien and Enemies Act, and I'm not sure anybody knows that. And while I love constitutional law, I'm not a constitutional lawyer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. PAUL: I do think it goes to the Supreme Court. And there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it. I want to ask you about some congressional business. I've seen it reported that you have pitched to Elon Musk a plan to claw back $500 billion in federal funding that Congress has already approved. There was an effort back in 2018 to do something like this, and it failed. Do you think you can actually get this done in a rescission package, and how much money do you think you can get back?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, this goes to another huge legal question. Can the president impound money, or does he have to send it back and we approve the cuts through rescission, and this is going all the way to the Supreme Court also, because I think the Trump administration believes they can just not spend it. There's another question within the question, can the president and his people, can Secretary Rubio pause the spending. On that issue I think they will win. You will be able to pause spending as long as you don't go through the end of an appropriations year. If you get through that, I believe it's impoundment, and I think the court so far has said it has to come back, and less as the Trump administration argues that the empowerment Act is unconstitutional. So this was headed to the Supreme Court also. It is my personal belief we should adhere to the law as it is now, and that is, send it back and have Congress confirm it. It's a simple majority vote. It's called rescission. I did mention this to Elon Musk. He seemed enthusiastic. It can be done. No Democrats- you have to realize, no Democrats will cut one penny from any spending anywhere. But can we get all the Republicans, is the real question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can get 51 Republicans, you think, to get on board with this?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, I think the president's gonna- the president is going to have to use effectively his bully pulpit and his popularity to convince all Republicans to do it. It's not a given that Republicans will stand, will will vote for this. We tried it once in the first administration it was only--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Right, I remember--",
      "SEN. PAUL: --15 billion, and we we lost. We lost two Republicans. But my suggestion to the Trump-, my suggestion to the Trump administration is come to the Republicans who you suspect might have misgivings and convince them, in advance, don't put it in their lap. Bring them 500 billion. If they say this, 10 billion, I can't deal with, I can deal with the 490, you're gonna have to pre negotiate the rescissions package. But I think you could get there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Department of Education. States, as everyone I think knows, provide the majority of the funding and oversight for your local schools. But Kentucky, when we looked at the numbers, gets the fourth most federal education funding per student of any state in this country. You have over 900 schools that have these Title One programs, which are low income schools who need that federal subsidy to continue to operate. How are schools going to get that money if the president closes the Education Department?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think the bigger question, if we're sending all this money to Kentucky and all the other states, why are our scores abysmal? Why do two thirds of the kids not read at proficiency? Why do two thirds of the kids or more not have math proficiency? So it's an utter failure\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that up to the state?",
      "SEN. PAUL: What I'd like to- let me finish, I'd leave it back to the States. It has always been a position, a very mainstream Republican position, to have control of the schools by the states, send the money back to the states, or better yet never take it from the States. About half of our budget in Kentucky goes to education, and that's the same in a lot of states. I think we can handle it much better. When I talk to teachers, they chafe at the national mandates on testing they think are not appropriate for their kids. They think they waste too much time teaching-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Right--",
      "SEN. PAUL: --teaching to national testing. The teachers would like more autonomy, and I think the teachers deserve more autonomy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we look at the budget in Kentucky, the state receives 2 billion in federal education funding. Do you have a guarantee that the federal government, federal taxpayers will still provide 2 billion in education funding? That seems important to your state.",
      "SEN. PAUL: I'd rather well, no, what I'd rather is a guarantee that my kids can read and write and do math. The amount of dollars, look, the number of dollars has gone up exponentially, and our scores have gone the other way. So dollars are not proportional to educational success. What I want is success, and I've talked a lot about this, I think there are innovations we can do where there's more learning via some of the best teachers, and we pay them more. I would like to have an NBA or NFL of teachers, the most extraordinary teachers teach the entire country if not the entire world--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Who would run that? The education department?--",
      "SEN. PAUL: --And some of them- no what you'd find is they'd be selected out state by state across the nation. Look, people say, oh, without the department education, we'd have no testing. I was- I was in school before then, we did achievement tests in the sixth grade, the fifth grade, the eighth grade, and we compared ourselves across state lines. There were international testing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah--",
      "SEN. PAUL: --You don't need the Department of Education for any of that. But what I can tell you is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay--",
      "SEN. PAUL: --the best teacher in the world is not teaching the kids. What we need to do is have the best teachers and pay them more, but they wouldn't teach 30 kids. They might teach 10 million kids at a time, because it would be presented to the internet with local teachers reinforcing the lessons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm sure we'll be talking more about this. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" There is a lot to cover on the home front, but we begin first on national security. In just a few hours, U.S. officials will be holding talks with Ukraine, and tomorrow a separate round with Russia, in pursuit of a 30 day cease fire. In the meantime, the Trump administration is ramping up the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, sending a second aircraft carrier to the region. We begin this morning with White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. Good to have you here.",
      "WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Thanks Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Iran-backed Houthis, they continue to fire at Israel. What has the last week of bombing achieved? And if you're holding Iran responsible, what's next?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Well, we've taken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer. We've hit their headquarters. We've hit communications nodes, weapons factories, and even some of their over the water drone production facilities. Just in the last couple of days, President Trump has decided to hit the Houthis and hit them hard, as opposed to, in the last administration, where literally weeks or months would go by with these kind of one-off, pinprick attacks. And as a result, we've had one of the world's most critical sea lanes get shut down. I mean, these guys are like al Qaeda or ISIS with advanced cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and some of the most sophisticated air defenses, all provided by Iran, Margaret. Just to- so everybody understands the impact here, the last time one of our destroyers went through the straits there, it was attacked 23 times. 75% of our U.S. flag shipping now has to go around the southern coast of Africa rather than going through the Suez Canal. And keeping the sea lanes open, keeping trade and commerce open, is a fundamental aspect of our national security. The last administration was not effective. The Trump administration and President Trump have decided to do something much harder, much tougher and much- and what- you know, we'll see, but I think will be much more effective.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president said he's going to hold Iran responsible as well. Envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview that Iran had responded to this U.S. outreach via multiple channels. In regard to a letter sent by the president, Witkoff described it as an offer to Iran to \"create a verification program so [that] nobody worries about weaponization of [your] nuclear material.\" Can you clarify? Is the U.S. seeking the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program, or verification, like what President Obama put in place back in 2015 and President Trump pulled out of?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Full dismantlement. Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see. And this is- look--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they said they're interested?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --as President- as President Trump has said, this is coming to a head. All options are on the table, and it is time for Iran to walk away completely from its desire to have a nuclear- nuclear weapon. That- and they will not, and cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapons program.",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they responded --",
      "MIKE WALTZ: That's enrichment--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --to the president's call for peace talks?",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MIKE WALTZ: That is weaponization, and that its- its strategic missile program. Can you only imagine? We've seen the death and destruction that they're doing through its proxies, between Hezbollah, the Assad regime, the Houthis, and what have you. If they had nuclear weapons, the entire Middle East would explode in an arms race. That is completely unacceptable to our national security. I won't get into what the back and forth has been, but Iran is in the worst place it has been, from its own national security, since 1979, thanks to Hezbollah, Hamas, the Assad regime, and its own air defenses being taken out by the Israelis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there's still a chance for diplomacy? I know you won't get into- okay.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Well, of course, I mean, the President has all options on the table. But we want to be clear, this isn't some kind of, you know, kind of tit for tat that we had under the Obama administration, or Biden. This is the full program. Give it up, or there will be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you closer to home, what has been happening here with Tren de Aragua, TdA, we're going to call them, which have been designated by the Trump administration as terrorists. Last Saturday, 238 Venezuelan men were handed over to the government of El Salvador. 137 of them were deported using this rarely used, 1789 Alien Enemies Act. This is important because it gives the power to detain and deport without a court hearing first, if they come from countries at war with the U.S. In the hearing on Friday, it was revealed that El Salvador, where they're being held, rejected two of the people: one on the basis of gender, because it was a woman and they can't be held at a maximum security prison. The other because the person wasn't even Venezuelan at all. How does that kind of high consequence mistake happen?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Well, these kind of one-offs we'll deal with on an individual basis, but Margaret, the underlying issue here is twofold--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was a mistake that you acknowledge, here?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: I can't speak to those individual cases and the details of the individual cases, but what I can speak to is, President Trump has determined that this- this group is acting as a terrorist organization. It is terrorizing our communities through attacks, torture, rape, and the most awful of situations for those communities, number one, and number two, the Alien and Sedition Act fully applies, because we have also determined that this group is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. So--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have- I'm sorry, just to clarify on that. This is supposed to apply if the U.S. is at war with a country. You are saying you have evidence--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: We are saying--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that the government of Venezuela is directing these gangs?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --we are saying- we are saying that TdA is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. This is how the Alien and Sedition Act applies, and we cannot have district judges interfering with the Commander in Chief's actions to take care of, in the way he deems necessary, a terrorist organization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the U.S. is at war with Venezuela?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: And I gotta tell you, we can- we can debate on Article Two, Article Three. That's a fair debate. However, in this case, the Commander in Chief, President Trump, is taking decisive action to rid our communities of these gangs that are operating in a paramilitary fash- fashion, and that we know Maduro is deliberately emptying his prisons in a proxy manner to- to influence and attack the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's different. That's so different.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: But that's how--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That- the U.S. is not at war with the country of Venezuela. I know the Attorney General said on another network--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Look, this is not--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She- she thinks this is going to go to the Supreme Court.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Sure, that's fine, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to have this fight.",
      "MIKE WALTZ:\u00a0 No, but Margaret, we have instances where the IRGC from Iran have operated to- by with and through Mexican cartels, to then bomb facilities here in the United States. We've taken decisive action in that regard. We're going to take decisive action in this regard, and we're making a Washington D.C. distinction. When the American people are tired of being terrorized by these gangs. So--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No one is defending gangs, but the concern--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Well, but it sounds like it. It certainly sounds like it from the Democrats--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --on the other side. It sounds like--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that this is being carried out in a sloppy way.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --in the case of this judge that wanted to turn a flight around, full of gang members, that had intelligence packets that had determined what they're doing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was a woman sent to a men's- man's prison, and El Salvador said, no.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: I mean, okay, look--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's the question of, if you are suspending the ability to have a day in court--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --I can't speak to those individual details, If you want to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that you get the list right.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: But, under- right, but under--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right? That you can verify that these people are gang members.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Look, every one of them were here illegally. So first of all, we had every right and every- and should, deport every one of these individuals. If you want--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they weren't deported, they were sent to prison.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --to make a special case for one, that's fine. But underlying that- underlying that, is the Alien Act that has determined that Commander in Chief has the absolute authority to do this.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk about this more with the Homeland Security Committee Chair, Rand Paul, ahead, I'm sure. I need to get to Ukraine with you, because this is active diplomacy, as we mentioned. The- the Ukrainians accepted this U.S. cease fire without preconditions, according to the announcement. The Russians said, only holding back on energy infrastructure. What's the goal out of these talks that are about to begin in Saudi Arabia?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Yeah, well, first we're- we're moving closer, and we're closer to peace than we ever have been. This started with President Trump talking to both leaders back to back. We then- Secretary of State Rubio and I engaged the Russians, engaged the Ukrainians at our level, and now we have technical teams actually with Ukrainians and Russians in the same facility, conducting proximity talks. And the progression will be, we have this cease fire on- on aerial infrastructure. That went in place immediately after President Trump's call with President Putin this week. We are now going to talk about a Black Sea maritime cease fire so that both sides can move grain, fuel, and start conducting trade again in the Black Sea. And then we'll talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines, and that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peace keeping, you know, freezing the lines where they are. And then, of course, the broader and permanent peace, which will be some type of discussion of territory for permanent peace, and- and a lasting peace, you know, what the Ukrainians tend to talk about, or- or have talked about, as security guarantees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things the president has said he wants to see is the return of these Ukrainian children who were abducted as part of a state program by Russia to russify them, take them from their families and move them into Russia. Why did the State Department cut off funding to one of the programs that helps find these kids? It's a Yale University Program, and they said the- the money was cut off. There are senators, including Grassley and Tillis, who- who want to know, why? Do you know why?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Well, Secretary Rubio is conducting a review of all of those programs. I can't speak to that specific one, but I can say--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it seems at odds with--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --that President Trump has spoken to both leaders about prisoner exchanges. Both the Russians and Ukrainians exchanged prisoners, nearly 200, immediately following their call. And he's also talked about the future of these children. So that's certainly, first and foremost, and, kind of, confidence building measures. But again, Margaret, we have to take a step back. We have to take a step back. Just a few months ago, no one was talking about how this war would end. And we have to ask ourselves, what would it look like a year from now, two years from now, three years from now? We were in an endless stalemate here, and now we have both sides in the same facility with the United States really living out, I think, in real time, President Trump's vision to end this war, which he campaigned on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be clear, are you asking for the release of these children as a confidence building measure? Is that what you meant?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: We're talking through a number of confidence building measures. That's one of them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Thank you, Mike Waltz.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"Face the Nation\" should be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "After firing more than 200 probationary workers from the nation's federal disaster relief agency, the Trump administration has taken its first step to dismantle the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) just months ahead of hurricane season.",
      "In an email labeled, \"Hiring Update\" and obtained by CBS News, FEMA informed employees on Friday night of a new hiring process that overhauls contract renewals for more than two-thirds of the agency's workforce, requiring all employees to submit requests for further extensions to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for approval.",
      "The decision has created confusion among the ranks of thousands of employees impacted, with fears that the new process will effectively gut the majority of FEMA's workforce over the next two to four years by forcing employees to reapply for their jobs through the agency's overseers at DHS.",
      "Spurred by President Trump's executive action last month directing the Department of Government Efficiency or \"DOGE\" to initiate large-scale reductions in the federal workforce, the new policy affects members of the agency's Cadre of On-Call Response known as \"CORE\" as well as FEMA's reservists.",
      "\"This change will apply to most FEMA positions, as two-year and four-year COREs and Reservists compose much of the workforce,\" the email read.",
      "FEMA acting Administrator Cameron Hamilton briefed his leadership team on the decision last week, according to multiple agency sources, prompting regional directors to break the news to employees in all-hands meetings held on Thursday and Friday that left many staffers bewildered and upset.",
      "\"Employees have started to take their leave and go job hunting,\" one current FEMA employee told CBS News. \"They've seen the writing on the wall.\"",
      "FEMA's more than 8,800 CORE employees make up roughly 39% of the agency's workforce, according to a recent U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, and are tasked with delivering disaster assistance before and after hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and other federally declared emergencies. Notably, the first responders are uniquely financed through the Disaster Relief Fund, allowing them to operate through government shutdowns.",
      "CORE employees staff recovery centers, sign up survivors for recovery assistance and perform door-to-door checks on communities that are devastated by storms and extreme weather events. The agency's roughly 7800 reservists make up a temporary, on-call workforce that is also deployed to disasters, emergencies and critical training, nationwide.",
      "The email directed employees with contract termination dates after March 17 to submit requests for \"renewals and extensions\" to the Department of Homeland Security \"for decision.\"",
      "The hiring announcement does not apply to certain positions within The National Flood Insurance Program, and positions including Emergency Management Specialist, Human Resources Specialist, Contracting Specialist, Information Technology Specialist and attorney, according to the email sent to the FEMA workforce, Friday.",
      "The email also states that all external hiring and onboarding of new employees has been frozen until further notice, except for political appointees.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Saturday, a DHS spokesperson said the decision is \"cutting out wasteful spending and bureaucracy that slows down relief efforts.\"",
      "\"FEMA has implemented a full hiring freeze and instituted a DHS review process for all disaster-field positions that are up for renewal. The renewal review applies to the majority of the FEMA workforce,\" the spokesperson said. \"President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem know that disaster recovery efforts are best led by state and local officials, not federal bureaucrats.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing state and local governments to \"play a more active and significant role\" in preparing for emergencies nationwide.",
      "\"I say you don't need FEMA, you need a good state government,\" Mr. Trump said while visiting the Los Angeles communities following devastating wildfires in January. \"FEMA is a very expensive, in my opinion, mostly failed situation.\"",
      "For months, the president has toyed with the idea of eliminating the agency. The nation's disaster relief arm was established under the Carter administration and later reshuffled under DHS as the department was stood up post-9/11.",
      "Project 2025 policy proposals include a call for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "\"If states aren't ready, they better get ready,\" one current FEMA employee told CBS News. \"It takes FEMA four months to refresh and restock all of our goods that get sent out for hurricane season. I can't imagine the states are anywhere near staffed up enough or robust enough to handle this mission on their own.\"",
      "For her part, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has said that while the federal government should play a role in disaster relief, she supports the president's desire to \"get rid of FEMA the way it exists today.\"",
      "The move to reshape the hiring process for the agency's disaster relief foot soldiers also comes just months before the Atlantic Hurricane Season, which runs from June 1 to November 30.",
      "In an interview last December, former FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told CBS News the agency sees a federally declared disaster roughly every other day, with nearly 180 emergencies declared in the first 11 months of 2024 \u2013 a roughly 50% increase compared to 2023. The former administrator called the back-to-back disaster demands on the agency a \"new normal.\"",

      "Also in the power hallway are Robert Gabriel, an assistant to the president, and Beau Harrison, deputy chief of staff for operations. Harrison is in the cubicle-like office Biden adviser Bruce Reed sat in and Gabriel sin Jen O'Malley Dillon's office.",
      "Technically, the desk with the least real estate between it and the Trump's Oval belongs to Margo Martin, a special assistant to the president and communications adviser. She's in the outer Oval with Chamberlain Harris, a receptionist; Natalie Harp, a former One America News Network anchor who played a body-man role during the campaign; and Walt Nauta, a military aide and presidential valet who was accused of obstructing the government's efforts in an investigation into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents in Mar-a-Lago. The charges were dismissed by federal courts weeks into Mr. Trump's second term.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary RFK Jr., with help from DOGE, is planning a restructuring with sweeping cuts expected at multiple agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said.",
      "Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms.",
      "National Institutes of Health",
      "From the workforce at the National Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year.",
      "Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both.",
      "One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration.",
      "The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicy reported in November.",
      "There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019.",
      "One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff.",
      "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",
      "Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts.",
      "Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedy denouncing reports that half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs.",
      "The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted in more than 10% of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge raised questions about the lack of due process for immigrants deported under a wartime authority and rebuked the Justice Department for ignoring his order to turn around two deportation flights last Saturday.",
      "\"I made it very clear what you had to do,\" D.C. Chief District Judge James Boasberg told Drew Ensign, the government attorney leading the case. \"Did you not understand my statements in that hearing,\" he asked Ensign.",
      "The flights carried more than 200 Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport them. The law gives the president broad authority to expel foreign nationals during wartime. Boasberg blocked the administration from relying on that authority Saturday and in a hearing the same day, ordered the two flights to be turned around in midair and returned to the U.S. The Trump administration did not follow the order, stating later that the flights were outside of U.S. airspace and therefore outside of the judge's jurisdiction.",
      "\"You did tell them it was an order from me to turn the planes around \u2026 to bring back people to the United States? You understood that,\" Boasberg said Friday. \"Did you understand that when I said 'do that immediately,' I meant it?\"",
      "\"I understood your intent to be what you were announcing would be binding,\" Ensign replied. The Justice Department has argued that because Boasberg's verbal order was not reflected in a written order, it was not binding.",
      "Boasberg reminded the government it can continue to deport immigrants, but it may not do so under the Alien Enemies Act. \"It's important for the public to make sure those facts are clear,\" he said. He expressed concern that the proclamation was \"essentially signed in the dark\" on Saturday and then the migrants were \"rushed onto planes.\"",
      "He asked whether the Trump administration had invoked the act quietly because it believes it to be problematic. The Justice Department declined to say more. Boasberg noted that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, \"had advance notice of this proclamation because it's impossible this could have happened within two hours,\" which Ensign confirmed.",
      "The legal question raised by the use of the Alien Enemies Act is whether the government can summarily deport people without an \"individualized assessment of their status,\" Boasberg said, raising questions about due process for the migrants. He asked the government, \"What happens if someone is not a member of Tren de Aragua or not a Venezuelan citizen or a U.S. citizen? How do they challenge their removal?\"",
      "The Justice Department did not offer a direct response.",
      "Boasberg asked hypothetically whether the president could declare Chinese fishing vessels were invading the U.S. \u2014 and then proceed to detain and deport all the Chinese fishermen. Ensign affirmed that he could.",
      "Ensign argued that the deportees maintain their ability to challenge their removal from the U.S. and detention in the El Salvador prison, even though they are no longer in U.S. custody. But he also argued that the Alien Enemies Act authorizes expulsion and detention of foreign nationals by the executive branch.",
      "Boasberg asked the government, if the detainees \"are entitled to some sort of hearing, some sort of individualized process \u2026 what is the standard for review of the executive's evidence\" about whether the detainees are members of Tren de Aragua and are Venezuelan?",
      "Deference to the executive branch should not be a given, Boasberg said. The Justice Department maintained that the court lacked jurisdiction and deference should be given to the executive.",
      "Boasberg asked the government what the role of the court was in ensuring that people aren't improperly deported to Salvadoran prisons. He also raised the Alien Terrorist Removal Court as an avenue for the Justice Department to remove aliens who are suspected of terrorism. It was established by Congress in 1996, but it has never been used to deport a suspected alien terrorist.",
      "\"If you determine that an alien is an alien enemy under the AEA and may be summarily removed, aren't you precluding that due process challenge?\" Boasberg asked.",
      "Boasberg also indicated he was considering narrowing his temporary restraining order blocking the administration from carrying out any deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He suggested he might modify it to allow the removal of those who admit they are members of Tren de Aragua or who do not challenge their deportation.",
      "He also asked for further briefing from both sides on remedies the government should set up for administrative proceedings such as a hearing board and legal review of the cases on an individual basis.",
      "\"We are a long way from the government being willing to provide people with this process,\" said Lee Gelernt, arguing for the plaintiffs. He welcomed the idea of administrative hearings but also asked for judicial review to prevent the Alien Enemies Act from being invoked \"against any gang.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:31:15 -0400",
    "summary": "A redistricting battle over Louisiana's congressional map has spanned years and been before the Supreme Court twice already.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with whether to leave in place Louisiana's congressional map\u00a0that was used in the 2024 elections and includes two majority-Black districts.",
      "The dispute is the latest involving claims of racial gerrymandering and the drawing of political districts to land before the high court following the recrafting of voting boundaries after the decennial census. In this case, the plaintiffs, who identify themselves as non-African American Louisiana residents, say the state relied too heavily on race when drawing a second majority-Black district for the state's congressional map.",
      "It was unclear following arguments whether the high court was inclined to preserve Louisiana's map for use in future elections. New district lines are drawn after every Census.",
      "The justices have in recent years weakened the Voting Rights Act, starting with the landmark 2013 decision that gutted the law's preclearance requirement. Before that decision, certain states and localities \u2014 mostly Southern \u2014 with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices were required to submit changes in election law to the Justice Department for approval before they could be implemented. The court ruled that the formula used by the Voting Rights Act to determine what states and localities were subject to Section 5 was unconstitutional because it was based on electoral conditions in the 1960s and 1970s, rather than on contemporary circumstances, and thus imposed unequal burdens on some states without sufficient justifying evidence.",
      "But in a surprising decision in 2023, the high court declined an invitation to reshape Section 2 of the landmark voting law and invalidated Alabama's congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers after the 2020 Census.",
      "The latest case before the court involves Louisiana's congressional map, which was redrawn last year to add a second majority-Black district to comply with Section 2, but then was found to be a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race.",
      "\"What we're looking at is the decision on how you draw districts to comply with the VRA and at the same time, not violate the 14th Amendment's ban on drawing districts based on race, where race is used excessively,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a professor at New York Law School who is an expert in redistricting.",
      "The dispute, he said, \"is a conflict of different issues coming to us at a time when the court is highly politicized.\"",
      "The case, known as Louisiana v. Callais, has ping-ponged around the federal courts, including twice at the Supreme Court, since 2022, when a federal district court in Baton Rouge issued the first decision in this long-running dispute. The judge, Shelly Dick, found the original map of Louisiana's six congressional districts that was enacted by the legislature in February 2022 likely violated Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength.",
      "That initial map from the GOP-led legislature had one majority-Black district. African-Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "The judge blocked the state from conducting congressional elections under those lines and ordered the state to put in place a remedial plan with two majority-Black House districts. A federal appeals court then upheld that injunction and set a deadline for Louisiana to draw the new voting lines.",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who took office in January 2024, called the legislature into special session to draw a new congressional map, with the understanding from state lawmakers that two of its six districts had to be majority-Black.",
      "The plan adopted reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to adhere to the district court's order and bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state officials said. But Louisiana state lawmakers said they had another goal: to protect certain Republican incumbents, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, they said.",
      "It did that at the expense of Garrett Graves, a Republican who represented District 6 and was at risk of losing his seat because of the redrawn lines. The new district has a Black voting age population of roughly 51%. It stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast, and connects predominantly Black populations from Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge.",
      "Shortly after the new redistricting plan was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged that the redrawn District 6 was a racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel in Shreveport found that the legislature predominantly considered race when it crafted the new voting lines and blocked the state from using the map in any election. But Louisiana lawmakers, along with a group of Black voters and nonprofits who challenged the original map from 2022, asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the state to use the plan for the 2024 elections.",
      "The Supreme Court granted the state and Black voters' emergency relief, and the November House elections were held using the redrawn map. Graves opted not to seek reelection, and Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, won the race for District 6. The high court agreed to take up the case in November.",
      "\"The court has faced this issue several times before,\" Wice said. \"But here we have a uniquely different case because we're looking at Louisiana trying to do three things.\"",
      "The first is to comply with the courts, the second is to draw a second minority district that would allow Black voters to elect their preferred candidate, and the third is to satisfy political demands to keep certain members of Congress in office, he said.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Louisiana officials argue that the non-Black voters who challenged the new congressional map did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing, because they failed to show how they were harmed by the alleged violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "But as to the merits of the case, the state and voters said race was not the sole factor involved in how the map was redrawn. Instead, Louisiana lawmakers said they had two criteria: that District 6 be majority-Black and that the broader congressional map protect Republican incumbents.",
      "The state said the blame for its considerations of race when drawing the new map lies with the district court, since it said the remedial redistricting plan had to have two majority-Black districts to comply with the federal voting rights law.",
      "\"Having forced the state into adopting a second majority-Black district, the federal judiciary cannot wash its hands of the matter now and point at the legislature,\" Louisiana officials said. \"If a bank robber holds a gun to a teller's head, no one would say that the teller's emptying the cash drawer was self-motivated. Just so here.\"",
      "But during the arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned how the high court is supposed to reconcile the state's acknowledgement that it took race into consideration to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act with the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "\"How do we square that with the 14th Amendment's promise that race should play no role [in our laws]?\" he asked.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts also highlighted the shape of District 6, which he said runs from one corner of the state to another, \"picking up Black populations as it goes along.\"",
      "But several of the liberal justices appeared to support Louisiana's argument that it was motivated by politics when it drew the lines of District 6, and decided to draw its own map to protect incumbent lawmakers rather than continue with litigation and risk the district court implementing its own voting lines.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan said state lawmakers had good reason to create a second majority-minor district, given the lower court's order, and implemented a map that reflected its political considerations.",
      "\"If the state can't do that, the state has no breathing room\" when drawing voting boundaries, she said.",
      "In their filings, Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court to provide a \"clear articulation\" of what voting map would survive review under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, and how states can avoid \"endless litigation\" that follows every Census moving forward.",
      "They also suggested that the Supreme Court rule that racial gerrymandering claims shouldn't be decided by the courts at all and should instead be left to the political branches. The proposal, which Louisiana officials said \"would be the best outcome for everyone,\" reflects a concurring opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas last year in a redistricting case from South Carolina.",
      "\"Drawing political districts is a task for politicians, not federal judges,\" Thomas wrote. \"There are no judicially manageable standards for resolving claims about districting, and, regardless, the Constitution commits those issues exclusively to the political branches.\"",
      "No other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and his view was not raised during the arguments. But whether any other of the other justices, namely the members of its conservative wing, come out in agreement with Thomas in this case remains an open question.",
      "Sarah Brannon, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said during a call with reporters that if at least four other justices embrace Thomas' position, it would set a bad precedent going forward.",
      "\"It would make it very difficult for civil rights groups, minority voters, to bring claims in the future to raise concerns that state legislatures are using race in a way that is intended not to help Black voters have more opportunities to elect candidates of choice, or voters of color to have opportunities to elect candidates of choice, but to essentially manipulate race in such a way that would deprive voters,\" she said.",
      "On the other side, the group of 12 non-African-American voters argued that the state set a \"racial quota\" of two majority-Black districts out of the state's six House seats.",
      "District 6, they argued in Supreme Court filings, is a \"sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district based on racial stereotypes, racially 'balkanizing' a 250-mile swath of Louisiana, from the far Northwest near Texas, down to [East Baton Rouge] near the Mississippi River's mouth.\"",
      "They also rejected the state's suggestion that the drawing of district lines be solely left to the political branches.",
      "\"The state's 'odious' stereotyping of citizens based on race (even to the 'shame' of many legislators and to Republicans' political detriment) and its tenacious efforts to freeze the gerrymander for the 2024 election show why the political process is insufficient to protect citizens against invidious discrimination,\" the voters said.",

      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Goldberg told CBS News, \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday afternoon, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly classified information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",

      "23andMe moved in November to slash 40% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan, a step that came roughly two months after its entire board resigned.",
      "\"We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities,\" 23andMe Chair Mark Jensen said in a statement. \"We believe in the value of our people and our assets and hope that this process allows our mission of helping people access, understand and benefit from the human genome to live on for the benefit of customers and patients.\"",
      "23andMe offers two basic kinds of services \u2014 consumer and therapeutics. The former provides people with information on their ancestry and genetic health profile, including the risk of passing on certain conditions to their children, according to S&P Capital IQ. The therapeutics unit works to develop treatments and conducts research into cancer, immune diseases and other conditions.",
      "Data privacy concerns",
      "23andMe's struggles have raised concerns about the privacy of its customers' genetic data, which is used to trace people's ancestry, among other purposes. In filing for bankruptcy protection, the company said there will be no changes to how it manages and protects people's data.",
      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",
      "In its bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe said any buyer of its assets would have to observe applicable privacy laws for customer data. The company has also previously said that any customer data it shares with other parties is anonymous and can't be traced to individual users.",
      "23andMe also allows customers to delete their accounts. To do that, users must log in to their account and submit a request. The company will send an email confirming the request to delete the data, which the user must then verify.",
      "23andMe's stock, which once traded for more than $300 a share, fell to 79 cents before the start of trade Monday. In January, 23andMe reported a third-quarter net loss of $26.8 million on revenue of $60.3 million, an improvement over its loss of $259.7 million on revenue of $44.7 million in the year-ago period.",
      "The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. 23andMe said that, if granted approval in bankruptcy court, the company would solicit bids from potential acquirers over a 45-day period and potentially conduct an auction.",
      "One possible buyer is Wojcicki herself. The executive, who recently submitted an acquisition offer that 23andMe rejected earlier this month, said in a social media post Monday that she may again bid for 23andMe.",
      "\"I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,\" she wrote, adding that continues to believe in the company's brand and business.",
      "\"We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today. There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,\" she said.",

Weldon had also floated Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo for the role, calling for him to be at the top of Mr. Trump's list to replace him as the nominee.",
      "If confirmed, Monarez would be the first head of the CDC to be voted on by senators, under a change passed by Congress in 2022. Previous directors of the agency were able to take the reins soon after they were picked by the president, without undergoing the confirmation process.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0 An appeals court judge said Monday that Nazis were treated better under the Alien Enemies Act than Venezuelan migrants removed from the U.S. and flown to El Salvador earlier this month.",
      "\"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" Judge Patricia Millett said, admonishing the Justice Department during oral arguments.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" said Drew Ensign, the government's attorney",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged Tren de Aragua gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison did not have the chance to appear in court.",
      "The judge said the question at hand wasn't the use of the act, but rather, the right of detainees to have due process and challenge their status as accused members of the gang.",
      "Millett, appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, said migrants may continue to be detained under the Alien Enemies Act, but they may not be deported until there is a decision on a preliminary injunction to stop the removals.",
      "\"No president has ever used this statute this way,\" Millett said. The Alien Enemies Act has only been invoked three other times \u2014 during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. It has never been used when the U.S. was not at war. She raised concerns about the act's implementation by government employees who may have removed people to El Salvador who were not Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Judge Justin Walker asked Ensign whether individual hearings were required before deportations, as D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg had written in his order Monday.",
      "Ensign responded, \"I agree with part of that.\" Walker, a Trump nominee, pressed him on how that would work.",
      "\"There are some individualized Habeas hearings being heard in Texas,\" Walker said. He asked, \"If they can bring a habeas petition and say they're not a member of [Tren de Aragua] \u2026 how would they bring that habeas claim?\"",
      "Millett, too, asked Ensign about the men who were deported to El Salvador as gang members: \"Were people on planes last weekend given the ability to file habeas?\"",
      "The government responded that yes, the five plaintiffs were able to appear in court. But the plaintiffs were not on the deportation flights that are at the center of the case, and they remain in custody in Texas.",
      "Ensign said he did not know how many migrants are being held in the U.S. under the AEA and said those who are currently held are being detained under Title 8 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Ensign argued habeas petitions to appeal detention could be filed on behalf of this class in Texas.",
      "\"When were they given notice that they were being detained as part of [Tren de Aragua]\" and how much notice was given before they were put on the plane, Millett asked.",
      "Ensign said the answers were not in the record. He told the appeals panel, \"We've agreed challenges to individual determinations can be brought.\"",
      "But Millett pressed him further, asking whether \"the government considers itself within its right to pack every member of this class on an airplane before there is a reasonable amount of time to file a habeas petition?\" Ensign did not respond immediately, but later said the statute does not require such notice \u2014 notice, that is, that they were being detained as Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorney Lee Gelernt of the ACLU claimed, \"There was no process,\" and migrants \"were designated [Tren de Aragua] without any advance notice and rushed onto planes.\" He said he would soon submit declarations reflecting this.",
      "The government also made the case before the appeals panel that it should be moved to another venue and that the president's decision to invoke the AEA was not reviewable.",
      "Ensign said the lower court's order blocking the Trump administration from deporting alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the act represented an \"enormous intrusion\" into presidential power.",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg on Monday rejected the government's motion to rescind his order regarding the administration's use of the AEA for deportations. He found the plaintiffs were likely to win on the merits of the case because they're entitled to due process and individual hearings.",
      "He also expressed doubt that Mr. Trump's use of the act for these deportations is lawful, writing, \"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion.'\"",
      "Judge Walker appeared to take the government's side about the venue where the case was brought, pointing out that the complaint, which is being heard in Washington, D.C., could have been filed in Texas, where the five original plaintiffs are in custody.",
      "Gelernt conceded the point, but argued \"this has all been done in secret,\" and it would not have enabled hearings to be held on an individual basis for all those accused of being gang members. The government has not released the names of the 238 men deported on two flights to El Salvador who are now being held in a maximum security terrorism prison, although CBS News reported their names last week.",
      "\"Absent a class [temporary restraining order], we would have had far more people sitting in a Salvadoran prison,\" Gelernt said.",
      "\"I think that's a tough precedent for you,\" Walker told Gelernt, because no suit was being brought in Texas, where the defendants were being held.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:01:55 -0400",
    "summary": "The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil\u200b, a former Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian protester, is raising questions about the rights of green card holders.",
    "story": [
      "The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder and former Columbia University student involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024, has raised questions about the rights of permanent residents in the United States.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil, a lawful U.S. resident married to an American citizen, in New York on March 8. He is currently being held in Louisiana.",
      "Khalil is not facing criminal charges. The Trump administration initially argued it could deport him on foreign policy grounds and later accused him of immigration fraud.",
      "Here's what to know about the rights of green card holders:",
      "What is a green card?",
      "A green card, or a Permanent Resident Card, allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the United States. Individuals can be eligible for a green card through family, employment, refugee status and other reasons.",
      "Most green cards are valid for 10 years and then need to be renewed, similar to how U.S. citizens need to renew their passports, explained David Leopold, an immigration law expert and partner at UB Greensfelder.",
      "\"The card expires, but the residency doesn't expire,\" he said, adding if a card is \"not renewed, there could be ramifications because you have to maintain the registration, but the status itself never expires assuming the person complies with the law.\"",
      "How can a green card be revoked?",
      "There are a number of reasons why an individual could lose their green card and be deported.",
      "\"Any green card holder can be subject to deportation depending on the situation,\" Leopold said.",
      "Most cases occur because a green card holder commits a crime, including violent crimes, marriage fraud, controlled substance abuse and other offenses. If they are convicted, typically after they serve their sentence in the U.S., they would face removal proceedings that involve going before an immigration judge, Leopold said.",
      "A person can also lose their permanent resident status because of \"substantiated charges of immigration fraud in the immigration process,\" Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia Law School professor and director of the university's Immigrants' Rights Clinic, said.",
      "Mukherjee said people whose green cards are being revoked are typically given a notice to appear before an immigration judge.",
      "\"They have the opportunity to either contest why they should be allowed to keep their status or concede that their status can be taken away,\" she said. \"Lawful permanent residents can't be stripped of their status in the United States without any due process.\"",
      "The severity of the crime may affect the judge's decision. In cases of violent crimes, \"deportation becomes nearly automatic,\" Leopold said. In some cases, an individual may be able to ask a judge to cancel their deportation. The judge would have to decide whether the person's conviction is outweighed by other considerations, such as community ties, family ties or their work in the U.S., he explained, but added, \"that doesn't apply to every case.\"",
      "The procedure for how a green card holder's status could be revoked is set by the Immigration and Nationality Act, Mukherjee said.",
      "Under the act, green card holders do not need to be convicted of a crime to be deported, Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, told The Associated Press. For example, if there are reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in, or are likely to engage in, terrorist activities, they could be deported, she said.",
      "Another reason a green card holder could lose their status is if they leave the United States for too long.",
      "\"Typically if they stay out of the United States for more than a year,\" their status will be challenged when they come back, Leopold said.",
      "Green card vs. citizenship",
      "A green card holder is not a citizen. To become a naturalized citizen, they would need to apply and meet various requirements.",
      "Do green card holders have the same rights as U.S. citizens?",
      "Everyone in the United States is protected by the U.S. Constitution. This includes green card holders, visa holders and undocumented immigrants.",
      "But, unlike citizens, green card holders are susceptible to being removed if they violate their status in the U.S., Leopold said.",
      "What is the Immigration and Nationality Act?",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Act is a set of immigration law provisions enacted in 1952.",
      "The act includes numerous grounds for deportation, including a provision that says a non-citizen \"whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\"",
      "A government document filed on March 9 and obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration used this provision to argue Khalil is subject to removal from the United States.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged on March 11 that Khalil has distributed \"pro-Hamas\" flyers. Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist group that has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, is responsible for the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, said in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that the allegation he circulated pro-Hamas flyers is not true, and his attorney, Amy Greer, said in a statement his detention was illegal.",
      "\"He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent, in violation of the First Amendment,\" Greer said.",
      "Matthew Boaz, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky's J. David Rosenberg College of Law, wrote in a Lawfare article\u00a0that \"one cannot simply be stripped of their residency, even by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\"",
      "Cases alleging grounds for deportation go before a federal immigration judge, who works for the Department of Justice, \"so it's not an independent judiciary,\" Leopold said.",
      "\"The law requires that the government make its proof by clear and convincing evidence,\" which is the highest standard in civil law, but not as high as beyond a reasonable doubt, required in criminal cases, Leopold explained.",
      "The particular foreign policy provision referenced by the administration is rarely used, Leopold said, calling it \"a vestige of the Cold War.\"",
      "The administration later cited other grounds to deport Khalil in a federal court filing on March 17, accusing him of immigration fraud. The government alleges that on his green card paperwork, he did not disclose his work or involvement with UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees; the Syria office in the British embassy in Beirut; and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "Where is Mahmoud Khalil being held?",
      "Khalil was arrested in New York by federal immigration authorities. He was first brought to a detention center in New Jersey and then flown to another site in Jena, Louisiana, his lawyers said.",
      "\"Louisiana is home to several ICE detention facilities and it's fairly common for non-citizens who are facing removal proceedings to be transferred to places like Louisiana due to available detention space in that state,\" Robin Nunn, a legal analyst and trial attorney, told CBS News 24/7 on March 11.",
      "Khalil's attorneys are trying to reverse his transfer to Louisiana, calling it \"blatantly improper.\"",

      "The S&P 500 rose 100 points, or 1.8%, to close at 5,768. the Dow Jones Industrial Average, surged 598 points, or 1.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day up 405 points, or 2.3%.",
      "A White House official told AFP that planned levies on the automobile, semiconductor and other industries \"may or may not happen April 2,\" noting that the situation remained fluid.",
      "\"The market was primed to respond well if the administration pulled back on some of the tariff threats or even provided off ramps for the tensions, and that's kind of what we're seeing here,\" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird.",
      "So-called reciprocal tariffs President Trump threatened to slap on other countries to match what they charge on U.S. imports are still expected to take effect, the official said. Mr. Trump on Monday also threatened 25% tariffs against any nation that continues to buy oil or gas from Venezuela as of April 2. On social media, he said the U.S. will impose a \"secondary\" tariff on the country because it is home to a transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua..",
      "The Trump administration has deported immigrants it claims belong to the gang, which Mr. Trump has labeled a foreign terrorist group and wartime enemy.",
      "Markets clinging to hope",

      "\"Markets opened in a bit of a risk-on mood overnight. U.S. equity index futures gained from the outset, finding support from recent reports that President Trump's promised tariffs may be more targeted than he has previously stated,\" said John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst with Oxford Economics.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.5% last week, the index's first weekly gain since Feb. 14, although it remains down nearly 2% on the year. The Nasdaq has slid 5.8% in 2025 over concerns the huge technology companies that dominate the index could get caught in the crossfire between U.S. tariffs and countermeasures by other countries. The blue-chip Dow is essentially flat this year.",
      "Citing the potential impact of tariffs, the Federal Reserve earlier this month lowered its outlook for economic growth to 1.7%, down from its December forecast of 2.1%, while forecasting hotter inflation this year. A Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta model\u00a0that assesses current economic conditions forecasts growth in the first three months of the year at -1.8%.",
      "What investors are watching this week",
      "This week's calendar is relatively light on events likely to move markets. But on Tuesday, investors will zero in on a closely watched gauge of consumer confidence. The Conference Board, which represents large U.S. companies, in February reported the sharpest decline in its consumer sentiment index in more than four years.",
      "Analysts with investment research firm Wrightson-ICAP expect the Conference Board index in March to show a fourth straight monthly decline in consumer confidence.",
      "\"We look for a 5-point decline to 93, which would bring the cumulative decline since November to roughly 20 points and would be the weakest reading in more than four years,\" they wrote in a research note.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to pause a lower court decision requiring six agencies to reinstate more than 16,000 federal probationary workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court to pause a lower court decision that required six agencies to reinstate more than 16,000 federal probationary workers who were terminated.",
      "The request for emergency relief from the Justice Department is the latest intervention the administration is seeking from the Supreme Court as it faces more than 100 lawsuits challenging President Trump's policies. Already pending before the justices is a request to narrow injunctions that blocked implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. A decision on that request isn't expected until early next month.",
      "The latest bid from the Trump administration arose out of U.S. District Judge William Alsup's order earlier this month that required six agencies \u2014 the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury \u2014 to reinstate probationary workers who were fired last month.",
      "In the challenge brought by a group of labor unions and nonprofit groups, the judge said the terminations were likely unlawful because the Office of Personnel Management did not have the authority to direct the firings.",
      "But in the request to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote that the court's preliminary injunction let third parties \"hijack the employment relationship between the federal government and its workforce.\"",
      "\"And, like many other recent orders, the court's extraordinary reinstatement order violates the separation of powers, arrogating to a single district court the Executive Branch's powers of personnel management on the flimsiest of grounds and the hastiest of timelines,\" she wrote. \"That is no way to run a government.\"",
      "Alsup's order covers roughly 16,000 federal workers who were still in probationary status, or those generally in a one- or two-year trial period. A federal appeals court declined the Trump administration's request to halt the decision, leading the Justice Department to ask the Supreme Court for relief.",
      "\"This court should not allow a single district court to erase Congress's handiwork and seize control over reviewing federal personnel decisions \u2014 much less to do so by vastly exceeding the limits on the scope of its equitable authority and ordering reinstatements en masse,\" Harris wrote.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the district court's order forces the government to embark on a \"massive administrative undertaking\" to reinstate and onboard thousands of fired employees in just a few days.",
      "The firings of probationary workers came as part of Mr. Trump's broad initiative to shrink the size of the federal government, an effort that is being undertaken by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "More than 24,000 probationary workers were removed from their positions as part of the mass firings, the Justice Department revealed in a court filings submitted in a separate case challenging the terminations, which was brought in Maryland and involves 18 agencies.",
      "The judge overseeing that case also temporarily blocked the mass firings and ordered the affected federal workers at the agencies to be reinstated.",
      "As the legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term agenda make their way through the federal courts, the president and his Republican allies have launched attacks on district court judges who have issued temporary orders blocking enforcement of the policies while proceedings move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, a senior White House adviser, have repeatedly called for some of the judges to be impeached, though it's unlikely any effort to remove them would be successful. But the president and GOP lawmakers have also condemned the relief the judges are issuing, and particularly the fact that they apply nationwide.",
      "In Supreme Court filings in the case involving Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship executive order, Harris urged the justices to rein in the use of nationwide injunctions.",
      "\"Government-by-universal-injunction has persisted long enough, and has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks,\" she wrote. \"It is long past time to restore district courts to their 'proper \u2014 and properly limited \u2014 role \u2026 in a democratic society.'\"",
      "Harris reiterated that request Monday in the dispute over the mass firings of federal workers, urging the high court to \"end the interbranch power grab.\"",
      "\"Those orders have sown chaos as the Executive Branch scrambles to meet immediate compliance deadlines by sending huge sums of government money out the door, reinstating thousands of lawfully terminated workers, undoing steps to restructure Executive Branch agencies, and more,\" she wrote. \"The lower courts should not be allowed to transform themselves into all-purpose overseers of Executive Branch hiring, firing, contracting, and policymaking.\"",

      "Cherry blossom season has arrived in Washington, D.C., where pink and white flowers dot thousands of trees around the city as this year's peak bloom approaches. To celebrate the iconic springtime sight, locals and tourists alike can participate in the National Cherry Blossom Festival, an annual event series that runs for four weeks and features a mix of art, music, food and more.",

      "Images show buds unfurling on cherry trees around the Tidal Basin, where flowering branches create some dazzling views in the foreground of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial and the Washington Monument. This picture was taken Friday, March 21, when peak bloom had not even arrived yet:",
      "The National Park Service determines the cherry blossoms' \"peak bloom\" date by predicting when 70% of the blossoms on the Yoshino cherry trees, which are the most common type of cherry tree planted along the Tidal Basin, will be open.",
      "Typically, peak bloom occurs between the last week of March and the first week of April, according to the park service, which notes that forecasting the peak is impossible to do more than 10 days ahead of time. The average peak bloom date falls on April 3, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which similarly advises that the exact timing varies from year to year because warmer temperatures can encourage an earlier bloom.",
      "Peak bloom is expected to happen sooner than the average date in 2025, with the park service estimating it will occur at some point between this Friday, March 28, and next Monday, March 31. The Yoshino trees usually bloom over the course of multiple days.",
      "The park service's National Mall branch announced Sunday that D.C.'s cherry trees had reached \"stage 5 - Puffy white,\" which is the final stage before peak bloom.",
      "\"The blossoms are starting to show, now we're just waiting on them to open,\" the agency wrote in a social media post. \"Peak Bloom is next!\"",
      "There are a multitude of opportunities for people to enjoy the cherry blossoms in D.C. before they disappear for the year. The city's Cherry Blossom Festival offers an extensive lineup of events, which are mostly free and pay homage to the city's culture and history.",
      "Held to commemorate the gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Tokyo's then-mayor Yukio Ozaki to Washington, D.C., the festival draws more than 1.5 million to a range of programs, according to its website. The events include a kite festival and the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade.",
      "Jeff Reinbold, the superintendent of National Mall and Memorial Parks, said in a statement that instilling community-wide appreciation for the cherry trees is a big part of the festival's mission.",
      "\"The National Park Service takes great pride in the work we do to care for the stars of this festival \u2013 the 3,700 cherry trees, which are both natural and cultural treasures of our city and our nation,\" Reinbold said. \"We encourage all visitors to the Festival to be good stewards of the trees and join us as \"cherry blossom protectors\" to help us preserve them for future generations and Festivals.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a case brought by casino mogul and Trump donor Steve Wynn that would have challenged a landmark decision that established a higher standard for public figures to successfully sue for defamation.",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday formally declined to consider 83-year-old Wynn's request to revisit the court's decision in a case known as\u00a0New York Times Company v. Sullivan\u00a0as a part of Wynn's legal battle against the Associated Press.",
      "The unanimous 1964 Supreme Court decision determined the First Amendment requires a public figure to prove a defendant acted with \"actual malice\" and knew a statement was false or recklessly disregarded the possibility that it was false to sustain a claim of defamation. The higher standard makes it more difficult for those in the public eye to win defamation cases. First Amendment advocates see it as a fundamental pillar on modern press freedoms.",
      "Wynn sued the AP in 2018 over its\u00a0reporting about sexual misconduct allegations against him from the 1970s that were filed with law enforcement. He stepped down from his position as chief executive of Wynn Resorts, which he founded, in 2018, after the Wall Street Journal published sexual misconduct allegations. Wynn also stepped down from his role as the finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. Wynn has consistently denied any allegations of misconduct.",
      "The New York Times v. Sullivan case came about after the newspaper published an ad soliciting donations to defend Martin Luther King Jr. on perjury charges. The ad contained some factual inaccuracies. Lester Sullivan, commissioner of public safety in Montgomery, Alabama, filed a libel action when the Times declined to publicly retract the information. All nine justices on the Supreme Court eventually agreed to overturn an Alabama court's decision and solidify protections for press coverage.",
      "The decision in the case has been targeted by some conservatives in recent years, and at least two sitting justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 have said the court should revisit the ruling.",

      "Wildfires that broke out in one North Carolina county have exploded in size, prompting mandatory evacuations as emergency crews fought separate fires in an area still recovering from Hurricane Helene. Meanwhile, in South Carolina, the governor declared an emergency in response to a growing blaze in the Blue Ridge Mountains.",
      "The North Carolina Department of Public Safety announced a mandatory evacuation on Saturday for parts of Polk County in western North Carolina, about 80 miles west of Charlotte.",
      "By Sunday night, three wildfires burning in the county had spread over nearly 2,500 acres, according to the North Carolina Forest Service. Two large fires covered more than 1,000 acres each and were not contained at all. Firefighters had been able to contain about half of a third, smaller fire covering some 150 acres, the forest service said. Two other fires were active in nearby Burke and Madison counties, with a third wildfire burning in Stokes County on the northern border with Virginia.",

      "\"It's not just the high winds, the low humidity, the steep terrain, but they're also dealing with storm debris that's blocking UTV trails, regular roads, and them just getting in on foot because we have so many trees down,\" Kellie Cannon, a spokesperson for Polk County, told CBS affiliate WSPA.",

      "The fire had grown to more than 1,300 acres as of Sunday night, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said, but noted, \"that estimate includes several hundred acres that were part of a burnout conducted by wildland firefighters to eliminate the fuels between evacuated residential areas and the many active wildfire fronts.\"",

      "Here's what to know about when and where to see the cherry trees in bloom.",
      "When will the cherry blossoms bloom in Washington, D.C., this year?",
      "Peak bloom occurs when 70% of the blossoms of the Yoshino cherry trees, the most common type along the Tidal Basin, are open. The National Park Service, which tracks the blooming of the trees each year, predicts peak bloom will be between March 28 and 31 this year.",
      "Based on over 100 years of data, the average peak bloom date is April 3, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The timing of peak bloom varies each year, largely due to temperatures, with warmer temperatures leading to earlier peak blooms.",
      "Since 1921, when the National Park Service began recording the dates, peak blooms have shifted earlier by about eight days, the EPA says.",
      "What is the status of cherry blossoms in D.C.?",
      "As of March 23, 70% of the Yoshino cherry trees around the Tidal Basin reached the fifth stage in their blooming, which is puffy blossoms, according to the National Park Service. The next stage is peak bloom.",
      "A live camera provided by the Trust for the National Mall offers viewers a chance to check the status of some of the blossoms.",
      "Where to see the D.C. cherry blossoms",
      "The most famous place to see the cherry blossoms in the nation's capital is around the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park. Many cherry trees are also along a section of the Potomac River and Washington Channel in East Potomac Park.",
      "This year, construction that began in August 2024 to replace seawalls along the Potomac River and part of the Tidal Basin could affect the viewing of some of the cherry trees. The work is expected to last through 2026.",
      "However, there are many other cherry trees throughout Washington, D.C. Casey Trees, a nonprofit that plants and cares for trees in the city, provides a map of where to see the blossoms across Washington. The map does not include trees on private property, the organization said.",
      "How long will the cherry blossoms last in D.C.?",
      "The Yoshino cherry trees usually bloom for several days, the National Park Service said, but weather conditions will affect the length of time.",
      "\"Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms,\" the agency said on its website. \"A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\"",
      "Why does D.C. have cherry blossoms?",
      "Japan gifted more than 3,000 cherry trees to the United States in 1912 as a symbol of friendship.",
      "That year, first lady Helen Herron Taft and the wife of the Japanese ambassador, Viscountess Chinda Iwa, planted two of the Yoshino cherry trees along the Tidal Basin, the National Park Service notes in a history of the trees. In the next few years, the trees continued to be planted around the basin and other areas.",
      "But the idea to plant Japanese cherry trees in the U.S. capital was raised as early as 1885 by a woman named Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, a writer and diplomat, according to the National Park Service.",
      "Despite her first request to the U.S. Army Superintendent of the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds not going anywhere, she continued to ask and eventually wrote to Herron Taft, who helped bring the idea to life, the agency says.",

      "The move will affect immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who flew to the U.S. under a Biden administration program, known as CHNV, that was designed to reduce illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border by giving would-be migrants legal migration avenues.",
      "A total of 532,000 migrants entered the U.S. under that policy, which was paused soon after President Trump took office, though it's unclear how many have been able to secure another status that will allow them to stay in the country legally.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security said it will seek the arrest and deportation of those subject to the policy change if they fail to depart the U.S. in the next 30 days. Officials are urging migrants to use the newly repurposed CBP Home smartphone app to register for self-deportation.",
      "But DHS said it retains the authority to target migrants who arrived under this program before the 30-day period lapses. Officials say those prioritized for arrest will include migrants who have failed to apply for another immigration benefit like asylum or a green card.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: The tsunami of activity shaking up Washington and beyond continues. And President Trump prods Ukraine and Russia toward peace.",
      "Overnight, the U.S. pounded Iranian-backed Houthi targets in Yemen again. And the backlash grows over the Trump administration's deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members. We will talk to White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, the head of the Senate Homeland Security Committee Kentucky Republican Rand Paul, and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut's Jim Himes.",
      "Meanwhile, members of Congress may have been happy to head home for recess last week, but now they may be eager to get back to Washington.",

      "MAN: Do you share a concern that we're careening toward an authoritarian country?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As elected officials on both sides of the aisle got an earful from angry constituents.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MAN #1: The message that was sent by Democrats in Congress with the C.R. catastrophe was clear. It's not that you're in the minority. It's that you aren't even working together on a shared strategy. And that is failure!",
      "MAN #2: Why do you believe that President Trump is above the law? Why have you not spoken out for it?",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, measles infections have now been reported in 18 states. We will consult with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb about that and talk about the impact of Trump's cuts on medical research.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "There is a lot to cover on the home front, but we begin first on national security. In just a few hours, U.S. officials will be holding talks with Ukraine and tomorrow a separate round with Russia in pursuit of a 30-day cease-fire.",
      "In the meantime, the Trump administration is ramping up the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, sending a second aircraft carrier to the region.",
      "We begin this morning with White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "MIKE WALTZ (U.S. National Security Adviser): Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the Iran-backed Houthis, they continue to fire at Israel. What has the last week of bombing achieved? And if you're holding Iran responsible, what's next?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, we have taken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer. We have hit their headquarters. We have hit communications nodes, weapons factories, and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities just in the last couple of days.",
      "President Trump has decided to hit the Houthis and hit them hard, as opposed to, in the last administration, where literally weeks or months would go by with these kind of one-off pinprick attacks. And, as a result, we have had one of the world's most critical sea lanes get shut down.",
      "I mean, these guys are like al Qaeda or ISIS with advanced cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and some of the most sophisticated air defenses, all provided by Iran, Margaret. Just to \u2013 so everybody understands the impact here\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 the last time one of our destroyers went through the straits there, it was attacked 23 times; 75 percent of our U.S.-flagged shipping now has to go around the southern coast of Africa, rather than going through the Suez Canal.",
      "And keeping the sea lanes open, keeping trade and commerce open\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 is a fundamental aspect of our national security. The last administration was not effective.",
      "The Trump administration and President Trump have decided to do something much harder, much tougher, and much \u2013 and what \u2013 we will see, but I think will be much more effective.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president said he's going to hold Iran responsible as well. Envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview that Iran had responded to this U.S. outreach via multiple channels in regard to a letter sent by the president.",
      "Witkoff described it as an offer to Iran to create a verification program so nobody worries about weaponization of nuclear material. Can you clarify, is the U.S. seeking the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program or verification, like what President Obama put in place back in 2015 and President Trump pulled out of?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Full dismantlement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see.",
      "And this is \u2013 look, as President\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they said they're interested?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: As President Trump has said, this is coming to a head. All options are on the table.",
      "And it is time for Iran to walk away completely from its desire to have a nuclear weapon. That \u2013 and they will not and cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapons program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they responded to the president's call for these talks?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: That's enrichment, that is weaponization, and that is its strategic missile program.",
      "Can you only imagine?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We have seen the death and destruction that they're doing through its proxies, between Hezbollah, the Assad regime, the Houthis and what have you. If they had nuclear weapons, the entire Middle East would explode in an arms race.",
      "That is completely unacceptable to our national security. I won't get into what the back-and-forth has been, but Iran is in the worst place it has been from its own national security since 1979, thanks to Hezbollah, Hamas, the Assad regime and its own air defenses being taken out by the Israelis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there's still a chance for diplomacy? I know you won't get into\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: The president has all options on the table, but we want to be clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: This isn't some kind of \u2013 kind of tit for tat that we had under the Obama administration or Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: This is the full program. Give it up or there will be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, closer to home, what has been happening here with Tren de Aragua, TDA, we're going to call them, which have been designated by the Trump administration as terrorists.",
      "Last Saturday, 238 Venezuelan men were handed over to the government of El Salvador; 137 of them were deported using this rarely used 1789 Alien Enemies Act. This is important because it gives the power to detain and deport without a court hearing first if they come from countries at war with the U.S.",
      "In the hearing on Friday, it was revealed that El Salvador, where they're being held, rejected two of the people, one on the basis of gender, because it was a woman and they can't be held at a maximum-security prison, the other because the person wasn't even Venezuelan at all.",
      "How does that kind of high-consequence mistake happen?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, these kind of one-offs, we will deal with on an individual basis.",
      "But, Margaret, the underlying issue here is twofold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was a mistake that you acknowledge there?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I \u2013 I can't speak to those individual cases and the details of the individual cases.",
      "But what I can speak to is, President Trump has determined that this group is acting as a terrorist organization. It is terrorizing our communities through attacks, torture, rape and the most awful of situations for those communities, number one.",
      "And, number two, the Alien Sedition Act fully applies because we have also determined that this group is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have \u2013 I'm sorry, just to clarify on that, this is supposed to apply if the U.S. is at war with a country. You are saying you have evidence that the government of Venezuela is directing these gangs?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We are saying \u2013 we are saying \u2013 we are saying that TDA is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. This is how the Alien Sedition Act applies. And we cannot have district judges interfering with the commander in chief's actions to take care of in the way he deems necessary a terrorist organization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the U.S. is at war with Venezuela?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And I got to tell you, we can \u2013 we can debate on Article II, Article III. That's a fair debate.",
      "However, in this case, the commander in chief, President Trump, is taking decisive action to rid our communities of these gangs that are operating in a paramilitary fashion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And that we know Maduro is deliberately emptying his prisons\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 in a proxy manner to influence and attack the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's different \u2013 that's so different\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But that's how\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. is not at war with the country of Venezuela.",
      "I know the attorney general said on another network\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, this is not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 she thinks this is going to go to the Supreme Court.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Sure. That's fine. But\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to have this fight.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: No, but, Margaret, we have instances where the IRGC from Iran have operated to \u2013 by, with and through Mexican cartels, to then bomb facilities here in the United States. We have taken decisive action in that regard. We're going to take decisive action in this regard.",
      "And we're making a Washington, D.C., distinction\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 when the American people are tired of being terrorized by these gangs. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No one is defending gangs. But there is concern\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, but it sounds like it. It certainly sounds like it from the Democrats on the other side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern that this is being carried out in a sloppy way.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: It sounds like in the case of this judge that wanted to turn a flight around full of gang members that had intelligence packets that had determined what they're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was a woman sent to a men's \u2013 man's prison, and El Salvador said no.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I mean, OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's the question of, if you're suspending the ability to have a day in court\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, I can't speak to the those individual details, if you want to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you get the list right, right\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you can verify that these people are gang members.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 look, every one of them were here illegally.",
      "So, first of all, we had every right and every \u2013 and should deport every one of these individuals. If you want to make a special case for one, that's fine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they weren't deported. They were sent to the prison.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But underlying that \u2013 underlying that is the Alien Act that has determined the commander in chief has the absolute authority to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk about this more with the Homeland Security Committee chair, Rand Paul, ahead, I'm sure.",
      "I need to get to Ukraine with you because this is active diplomacy, as we mentioned. The Ukrainians accepted this U.S. cease-fire without preconditions, according to the announcement. The Russians said only holding back on energy infrastructure.",
      "What's the goal out of these talks that are about to begin in Saudi Arabia?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes, well, first, we're moving closer and we're closer to peace than we ever have been. This started with President Trump talking to both leaders back to back.",
      "We then \u2013 Secretary of State Rubio and I engaged the Russians, engaged the Ukrainians at our level, and now we have technical teams actually with Ukrainians and Russians in the same facility conducting proximity talks.",
      "And the progression will be, we have this cease-fire on aerial infrastructure. That went in place immediately after President Trump's call with President Putin this week. We are now going to talk about a Black Sea maritime cease-fire, so that both sides can move grain, fuel and start conducting trade again in the Black Sea.",
      "And then we will talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines. And that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are, and then, of course, the broader and permanent peace, which will be some type of discussion of territory for permanent peace and a lasting peace, what the Ukrainians tend to talk about or have talked about as security guarantees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things the president has said he wants to see is the return of these Ukrainian children who were abducted as part of a state program\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 by Russia to Russify them, take them from their families and move them into Russia.",
      "Why did the State Department cut off funding to one of the programs that helps find these kids? It's a Yale University program. And they said \u2013 the money was cut off. There are senators, including Grassley and Tillis, who want to know why. Do you know why?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, Secretary Rubio is conducting a review of all of those programs. I can't speak to that specific one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it seems at odds with the goal.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But I can say that President Trump has spoken to both leaders about prisoner exchanges. Both the Russians and Ukrainians exchanged prisoners, nearly 200, immediately following their call.",
      "And he's also talked about the future of these children. So that's certainly first and foremost in kind of confidence-building measures.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But, again, Margaret, we have to take a step back. We have to take a step back.",
      "Just a few months ago, no one was talking about how this war would end. And we have to ask ourselves, what would it look like a year from now, two years from now, three years from now?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We were in an endless stalemate here. And now we have both sides in the same facility with the United States really living out, I think, in real time President Trump's vision to end this war, which he campaigned on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be clear, are you asking for the release of these children as a confidence-building measure? Is that what you meant?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We're talking through a number of confidence-building measures. That's one of them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Thank you, Mike Waltz.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Thank you. All right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee. And he joins us this morning from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "Because\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "Because of your role in on Homeland Security, I want to follow up where we left off with National Security Adviser Waltz. There are legal questions around using these authorities to send out detainees without giving them a day in court, but there's also just questions of how it's being handled in regard to these individuals who were rejected by El Salvador, one for gender, one because they weren't Venezuelan at all.",
      "Do these concern \u2013 does any of this concern you, along with claims from their family members that many of these people weren't gang members?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, there are some big legal questions here.",
      "On the one hand, the Bill of Rights applies to everyone, to persons. The Bill of Rights doesn't specifically designate citizens. It's really anyone in the United States the Bill of Rights applies to. On the other hand, the Alien Enemies Act simply says, you really don't get much process. The president can simply declare that you are somehow a problem for foreign policy and opposed to our foreign policy and you can be deported.",
      "So, really, ultimately, this goes to the court, and then the court's going to have to decide, are they going to declare unconstitutional a law that's been around for a couple hundred years or are they going to defer to Congress?",
      "If you look at the TikTok decision recently, which I don't agree with, but in the TikTok decision, the court basically said, we're going to defer to Congress. Congress says this is about national security, and who are we to question? And I think they should have ruled based on\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, and then the president issued an executive order that defied the congressional \u2013 what Congress did.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes. Right. Right.",
      "But my point is, is, I think the court should have ruled on the First Amendment with regard to TikTok and not said, oh, well, whatever Congress wants. But if you look at the TikTok decision and you had to guess what the Supreme County is going to do, my guess is, they will uphold the Alien Enemies Act. It's not necessarily my position, but I think the court will uphold it.",
      "So it's at least debatable on both sides who's right or who's wrong here. And I think it's not correct for Democrats to simply say\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 oh, it's constitutional chaos, there's no leg to stand on. There actually is legal authority on the one hand that's been around for over 200 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But just \u2013 we're not talking about partisan politics. We're talking about the courts right now and what the judge said he had questions about and talks about this being done essentially in the cover of night. This seems to be an argument the administration wants to have go to the Supreme Court.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with bypassing what you described as, you know, what's guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, a day in court, or at least some verification that some of these people actually are guilty in some way of what they're accused of, which is membership in a gang?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So we have a contradiction. We basically have the Constitution that says everyone, persons in the United States have due process rights, have the Bill of Rights on their side.",
      "But we also have law that has been in power for 200 years saying, oh, well, except when the president wants to deport people. So, these are in conflict. There will have to be some decision-making.",
      "On the question of whether or not a district judge can make a ruling for the whole country, that's also a very big question. And I suspect, as this works its way up to the Supreme Court, when you get to the Supreme Court, I do believe the Supreme Court is going to limit district judges from having nationwide rulings.",
      "So I think that's also in the offing. But these are huge legal questions. And the only way they begin is by a challenge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: If the president doesn't challenge these, they never have standing and never get to court. So, on the one hand, the president is generating this, but it's the only way to generate a final conclusion from the court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It just sounds \u2013 I mean, these are debates for law professors, certainly. But, in the meantime, there are individuals who may have been sent wrongly to these facilities that are outside the U.S. jurisdiction.",
      "Are you comfortable, as the man with oversight as chair of the committee, with what's being done?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the courts will rule that there has to be some process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, you're comfortable with it?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think you're going to be able to deport people \u2013 so, no, I \u2013 well, I don't think \u2013 you're answering for me.",
      "I think there is going to be some process afforded by the courts for representation before you're deported in most cases. I don't know about the ones under the Alien Enemies Act, and I'm not sure anybody knows that. And, while I love constitutional law, I'm not a constitutional lawyer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I do think it goes to the Supreme Court, and there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "I want to ask you about some congressional business. I have seen it reported that you have pitched to Elon Musk a plan to claw back $500 billion in federal funding that Congress has already approved. There was an effort back in 2018 to do something like this, and it failed.",
      "Do you think you can actually get this done in a rescission package, and how much money do you think you can get back?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, this goes to another huge legal question. Can the president impound money, or does he have to send it back, and we approve the cuts through rescission?",
      "And this is going all the way to the Supreme Court also, because I think the Trump administration believes they can just not spend it. There's another question within the question, can the president and his people \u2013 can Secretary Rubio pause the spending?",
      "On that issue, I think they will win. You will be able to pause spending as long as you don't go through the end of an appropriations year. If you get through that, I believe it's impoundment. And I think the courts so far have said it has to come back\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 unless, as the Trump administration argues, that the Impoundment Act is unconstitutional.",
      "So this one's headed to the Supreme Court also. It is my personal belief we should adhere to the law as it is now, and that is send it back and have Congress confirm it. It's a simple majority vote. It's called rescission. I did mention this to Elon Musk.",
      "He seemed enthusiastic it can be done. No Democrats \u2013 you have to realize\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 no Democrat will cut one penny from any spending anywhere.",
      "But can we get all the Republicans is the real question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can get 51 Republicans, you think, to get on board with this?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think the president is going to have \u2013 the president is going to have to use effectively his bully pulpit and his popularity to convince all Republicans to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's not a given that Republicans will stand \u2013 will vote for this.",
      "We tried it once in the first administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, I remember.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It was only $15 billion. And we lost. We lost two Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two Republicans.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But my suggestion to the Trump \u2013 my suggestion to the Trump administration is, come to the Republicans who you suspect might have misgivings and convince them in advance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Don't put it in their lap. Bring them $500 billion. And if they say, this $10 billion, I can't deal with, I can deal with the 490, you're going to have to pre-negotiate the rescissions package.",
      "But I think you could get there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Department of Education.",
      "States, as everyone, I think, knows, provide the majority of the funding and oversight for your local schools. But Kentucky, when we looked at the numbers, gets the fourth most federal education funding per student of any state in this country. You have over 900 schools that have these Title I programs, which are low-income schools who need that federal subsidy to continue to operate.",
      "How are schools going to get that money if the president closes the Education Department?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the bigger question, if we're sending all this money to Kentucky and all the other states, why are our scores abysmal? Why do two-thirds of the kids not read at proficiency? Why do two-thirds of the kids or more not have math proficiency?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that up to the state?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, it's been an utter failure. What I'd like to \u2013 let me finish.",
      "I'd leave it back to the states. It has always been a position, a very mainstream Republican position, to have control of the schools by the states, send the money back to the states, or, better yet, never take it from the states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: About half of our budget in Kentucky goes to education, and that's the same in a lot of states.",
      "I think we can handle it much better. When I talk to teachers, they chafe at the national mandates on testing, they think are not appropriate for their kids. They think they waste too much time teaching to national testing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: The teachers would like more autonomy, and I think the teachers deserve more autonomy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we looked at the budget in Kentucky, the state receives $2 billion in federal education funding. Do you have a guarantee that the federal government, federal taxpayers will still provide $2 billion in education funding? That seems important to your state.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I'd rather \u2013 well, no, I'd rather is a guarantee that my kids can read and write and do math.",
      "The amount of dollars \u2013 look, the number of dollars has gone up exponentially and our scores have gone the other way. So dollars are not proportional to educational success. What I want is success. And I have talked a lot about this. I think there are innovations we can do where there's more learning via some of the best teachers and we pay them more.",
      "I would like to have an NBA or NFL of teachers, the most extraordinary teachers, teach the entire country, if not the entire world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who would run that, the Education Department?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And some of them \u2013 no, what you would find is, they'd be selected out state by state, across the nation.",
      "Look, people say, oh, without the Department of Education, we would have no testing. I was in school before then. We did achievement tests in the sixth grade, the fifth grade, the eighth grade, and we compared ourselves across state lines. There were international testing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You don't need the Department of Education for any of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But what I can tell you is, the best teacher in the world is not teaching the kids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: What we need to do is have the best teachers and pay them more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But they wouldn't teach 30 kids. They might teach 10 million kids at a time because it would be presented through the Internet, with local teachers reinforcing the lessons.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us this morning from Greenwich.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "I want to jump right into it on the conversation about this Venezuelan gang. You have said some of your fellow Democrats have been too quick to use the term constitutional crisis. But because of the use of the Alien Enemies Act and this gang, you have started to become concerned that's where we are. Can you explain that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): Yes, that's right, Margaret, and thanks for having me.",
      "You know, constitutional crisis is a - a sort of broadly used term. Lots of people have different definitions for it. It's a lot of stuff you don't like.",
      "I'll tell you what I know is a constitutional crisis. If the president of the United States decides to ignore the orders of a court - we have not seen that since Andrew Jackson did that in 1834. When that happens, you have a supine on its back Congress of the United States, completely beholden to the president, not acting as a check. And if the president says, I don't care what the court - courts say, which, by the way, he has not said, but which Tom Homan, his czar for deportation has said, now you have a full-blown constitutional crisis.",
      "So, I think these next couple of days, as we see how this administration goes after the many judges and the many courts - many of these judges appointed by Republican presidents who are stopping the wild and illegal actions of this administration, we're going to see whether we are in a true, you know, Jacksonian constitutional crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of your role on the Intelligence Committee, I know you have some visibility into the assessments of U.S. intelligence. \"The New York Times\" reported that the intelligence community said, with moderate confidence, that the gang, TDA, that we've been talking about, is not directed by the Venezuelan government. However, the national security advisor just told us on this program, TDA is acting as a proxy of the Venezuelan government. Why does that distinction matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, well, it doesn't matter. And I'll come back around to that.",
      "But look, what - what - what people worry about is that this administration acts with an unbelievable kind of cocktail of incompetence and illegality. When you fire all of the people at the Department of Energy who look after our nuclear weapons and then say, oops, we need to hire you back, that's incompetence.",
      "I listened to Mike. Mike is a friend of mine. I have respect for Mike. But what he did was dodge your question. I'm not a lawyer, but I can read the first paragraph of the Aliens Enemy Act, which says very clearly that the authority that this administration claims is dependent on a declaration of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Not on acting as a proxy. So, Mike distorted the law. And, you know, I read \"The New York Times\" article, too. I haven't seen specific intelligence about whether there's any connection whatsoever between Venezuela and the TDA gang.",
      "But you're right, \"The New York Times\" - and, by the way, I'll get an answer on this tomorrow and I'm going to have some questions for Mike. \"The New York Times,\" of course, reported that there's - that the intelligence community believes that there's not a meaningful connection between Venezuela and the TDA gang. So, again, it's a bizarre combination of acting incompetently because maybe there's a Venezuelan hairdresser, a gay Venezuelan hairdresser with no connection to TDA. And if he's in this country illegally, fine, deport him. But to do it in this way under authorities that are not legal is not the way to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "You're - you're referring there to some reporting in \"Time\" magazine about what happened to some of these - one particular detainee. On Friday, the Justice Department announced a criminal investigation into what they described as the leak of classified intelligence about this group, TDA. The deputy attorney general said they won't \"tolerate politically motivated efforts by the deep state to undercut President Trump's agenda by leaking false information\" to \"The New York Times.\"",
      "Do you have any concern - or is there concern within the intelligence community about these leaks?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: There's always concerns about leaks, Margaret. As ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, I don't care who a leak benefits. Whether it benefits Joe Biden or Donald Trump or whatever, they are not OK. They are violations of the law.",
      "It's very interesting though that characterization that you just read, that we will not tolerate leaks that are inconsistent with President Trump's agenda. And this gets at one of my worst fears with respect to the national security operates under Donald Trump. Everything is about Donald Trump, right? And where I work, inside and overseeing the intelligence community, it is absolutely essential that the intelligence community be about one thing and one thing only, which is giving Donald Trump and other national leaders unvarnished, unbiased advise. And if this is all about serving the president's agenda, that is a notion that is completely at odds with what the intelligence community and what we spend $90 billion on making sure that policymakers, the president chief amongst them, has good information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was listening to a town hall that you did this past Thursday in Connecticut, and you were asked who the leader of the Democratic Party is. You threw out some of the sort of known entities, governors out there, but you said, \"while the party's not leaderless, Hakeem Jeffries is young and untested and Leader Schumer is not a wartime president.\"",
      "Do you think that your party can afford to stay the course with the existing leadership they have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, I think we can do a lot better job with the leadership that we had. What I was acknowledging in the town hall meeting - and I will tell you, I've seen a lot of town hall meetings. I saw Chuck Grassley's town hall meeting. I saw my colleagues from Wyoming - ruby red Wyoming's time in the barrel.",
      "And people are outraged. They're outraged mainly, by the way, because they're coming to understand what Medicaid cuts are going to look like for them, what it means to obliterate programs that so much of the country - 70 million people in the case of Medicaid - rely on. So, there's an immense amount of anger.",
      "What I do know is that it was not a good look for the two congressional Democratic leaders to be on opposite sides of the continuing resolution. That created a great deal of adjita (ph) out there, and legitimately so. So, I am quite certain that Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer have learned from this experience and are going to, at a minimum, be unified going forward here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see.",

      "We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to America's health care system and former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's also a board member at Pfizer.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, measles is now in 18 states, as I understand it. Mostly Texas and New Mexico. But we have seen a growing number of infections, particularly in children.",
      "What do parents need to know and are adults protected?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Adults who have been vaccinated should be protected. This vaccine provides durable immunity. And there's no recommendation that anyone who's already been vaccinated, had the full schedule of two doses of vaccine when they were children, would need to get another booster. But if people are concerned, they can check their titers (ph). The only recommendation that CDC makes is people who are taking care of those with measles, perhaps health care workers, might consider an additional booster later in life.",
      "The bigger challenge is with children. So, children get vaccinated, as you know, at one year, and then again when they're entering school at around age four. There's a window where children probably don't have a lot of immunity. So, a child born, has some immunity passed from their mom up until about six months. But there's a window between six and 12 months where they are largely unprotected. Typically, we don't vaccinate at six months because babies don't have developed immune systems where they can develop a durable immunity from an immunization like this. But there's some recommendations now that children, between the ages of six and 12 months, might get a first dose of vaccine. They would still require a second dose at age one and a third dose at age four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw the former CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, was talking about that this past week.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The current secretary of HHS, Secretary Kennedy, has said he wants anyone who desires the vaccine MMR to be able to get one. But he also describes himself as a, quote, \"freedom of choice person.\" I want to get your analysis of what seemed to be a suggested alternative treatment.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (HHS Secretary): They are getting very, very good results they report from Budesonide (ph), which is a steroid. It's a 30- year-old steroid. And they're - and erythromycin (ph) and also cod liver oil, which has high - high concentrations of vitamin a and vitamin d. And they are seeing what they describe as almost miraculous, instantaneous recovery from that.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are those viable alternatives?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: They're not viable alternatives to vaccination. And I'd much prefer if he made a full-throated recommendation to parents to get kids vaccinated, especially in a setting of the regions where there's virus now spreading. He's talking about steroids and antibiotics. Those will use in the setting of a child who has developed pneumonitis, who's hospitalized, has respiratory distress. And so you might dose them with antibiotics to prevent secondary infections. And steroids can reduce some of the inflammation in the lungs. The hope is children don't get into that kind of distressed situation because they've been vaccinated.",
      "As far as vitamin a is concerned, there's really scant evidence that it's effective in this setting. It's used in the setting of malnourished children where it might provide some benefit. But I think talking about those kinds of therapeutics in this context creates a false impression that there's treatments available for measles when, in fact, there's not. The only way to prevent measles and prevent the sequelic (ph) from measles is to get vaccinated.",
      "You know, it's the same way people may consider whether or not they choose to get vaccinated for influenza, for the flu. Some people might make a decision not to get vaccinated because they know therapeutics are available. I certainly would recommend that - that they do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think everyone should get vaccinated for influenza. But some people might make that choice. There is no choice in this setting. There's nothing effective at mitigating the effects of measles once you get it. So, the only way to do that is to get vaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the CDC website describes vitamin a as supportive care, but vaccination the best defense. So, thank you for explaining that.",
      "There's no CDC director right now. The administration had to pull their nominee, as you know, because they couldn't get enough votes. Alex Tin (ph) here at CBS is reporting Florida's surgeon general and a former Texas congressman, Michael Burgess, are both being floated for the job. How important is it to get someone confirmed and in the role quickly?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I think it's very important, especially when you see what's going on around the country with this measles outbreak in west Texas. We may have more measles cases this year than we've had in 25 years. And so having leadership at the CDC that can direct that response is exceedingly important.",
      "Mike Burgess ran the health subcommittee on energy and commerce, worked closely with the FDA when I was there. He was very good, very effective. He did a lot - a lot to advance our interdiction work in mail facilities to stop opioids from flowing through those facilities. He was very dedicated to that effort. Actually visited the mail facility in New York at JFK Airport to see firsthand the operation before he led a charge in Congress to help provide more funding to get more inspectors into the facilities. He has a lot of experience in a lot of the areas where CDC has a very relevant mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they'll have to face a potential vote once the president makes a selection here.",
      "I want to ask about some of the byproducts and some of them deliberate cuts from the president's so-called belt-tightening here. There have been impacts at, for example, Johns Hopkins, an institute that does medical research and receives USAID grants. There are also deliberate cuts that have been vowed at Columbia and UPenn, two universities that get federal funding and do health research. Do you have any insight into how many health programs or the significance of the health programs that will be affected?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I don't think anyone has insight into it yet. I think this is still playing out. These impacts are happening across a couple of different domains. There is restrictions on the ability to go forward with new grants because of limitations, for example, posting things in the federal register. There's new grant making policies that are being implemented. So, certain entities, certain countries are being added to lists where you can't do research. There were recently some grants canceled that coincided with research that would be done in conjunction with China. They're terminating certain grants on the basis of policy considerations, like whether or not they have a certain DEI component and however they are defining that.",
      "And then you see the institutional wide cuts. I think that's what happened to Johns Hopkins with respect to the USAID cuts. It's also what happened to Columbia with respect to that $400 million cut - federal cut that impacted a lot of research. There's - so there's multiple domains where they're being impacted right now. This is - this isn't all DOGE led.",
      "I think we need to be very careful when it comes to research programs where patients are involved.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know, if you make a mistake with a program like a website that you took down, you can always put it back up. But when you cut a grant to a program where patients are involved, where continuity of care is really important to those patients, you need to make accommodation for that, or not make those cuts in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I do know - I've had some conversations - I think DOGE is aware of that and trying to be mindful of those impacts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, it's a - it's an important point to be strategic when it comes to medical care.",
      "Dr. Gottlieb, thank you for your insight.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to the Venezuelan deportation case. And for what's next, we're joined by our Justice Department correspondent, Scott Macfarlane and our immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez.",
      "It's good to have you both here.",
      "Camilo, you did some extraordinary reporting this week and obtained the names of the migrants who were sent to El Salvador. That's information that the administration refused to share with a federal judge, but you got it.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you learn?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: We're still investigating every single case on this list of 238 Venezuelan men who were sent to El Salvador to be imprisoned there, but this is what we know. We know that according to court filings and also our own findings here at CBS News, some of the people on this list do have criminal histories in the U.S. or abroad in countries like Peru, Chile and Columbia. But we also know that, according to the government, many of these people do not have any criminal record in the U.S. And we have received documents from lawyers and attorneys and also the family members of the deportees who say that these people, some of them, do not have any criminal history in the U.S. But the administration is accusing all of them of being part of this transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua.",
      "But how that accusation is being made is at the center of this story. The administration says they have U.S. intelligence and other techniques to identify these people as suspected TDA members, but their relatives and their lawyers say that some of these men were identified as TDA simply because of tattoos.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is really where we get to the legal nub of the argument is, can you, as - as Senator Paul was saying, bypass the right to a day in court on the basis of someone having some tattoos?",
      "So, Scott, the Trump administration is going to have this appeal tomorrow, as I understand it. You were in federal court Friday when the judge said it was, quote, awfully frightening how the administration stretched the law. They are looking for this fight. Why?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: There's two different fights they're looking for. The legal is one of them. They are going to be in the appeals court tomorrow. They'll go to the Supreme Court potentially eventually, trying to consolidate power to make it an 18th century reality right now where you can expel people who are locked up currently on U.S. soil without having to go through the courts, even though the courts are trying to catch mistakes and make sure nobody's scooped upper erroneously.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though you could deport them anyhow?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: You can still deport them anyhow. That's one fight they're looking to fight.",
      "There's also the political one, Margaret. There is so much political upside",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: To all of this for the Trump administration. And you heard that from the national security advisor a few moments ago when he told you this is a D.C. distinction. That the administration is not exactly concerned about looking too aggressive in deporting suspected gang members. There's all kinds of wins there.",
      "And then there's the other one, Margaret. The villainization of Washington, D.C., federal judges, which can galvanize the conservative base and the Trump base. And you saw that Friday in the courtroom with the judge, James Boesberg, pushing back on the president's allegations that he just wants to set these gang members free. The judge said, they are still locked up. You can deport them the normal way without invoking this 18th century law. Let's see how much more pushback there is from the president to the judge. There was more overnight on Truth Social.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're - yes, he's spoken about it. He's posted about this judge, raising other concerns.",
      "Camilo, though, you actually have reported out what was done behind the scenes to bring this all to a head, to set up this fight. What did you learn?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: What I can tell you is that based on conversations with DHS sources, the administration was actively preparing for this operation well before the president actually signed this proclamation, unbeknownst to the public last Friday before the White House actually published the actual proclamation on Saturday, March 15th and before those planes took off -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning do it as quickly as possible?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. They staged a roundup across the country of suspected TDA members and transferred those people to a Texas detention center. And by the time the judge held the first emergency hearing on this case, there were already two planes in the air and another one ready to take off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Knowing that they might have to face a fight back in the courts.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, the president has issued at least three executive orders that we have clocked impacting private law firms who represented clients at odds with President - or then Mr. Trump. That's bad for private business. One of those law firms cut a deal, $40 million. What's the impact here?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I talked to one of the lawyers who's been targeted by one of these actions. He says, they're trying to take me off the playing field. They're trying to take others off the playing field as we continue to challenge the administration in course. A chilling affect to make it harder to file these lawsuits that have been the firewall so far on the Trump administration.",
      "But there's a distinction in the latest round of actions prohibiting these law firms based in Washington from doing business in government buildings or with government employees. That is a death sentence for a Washington, D.C. law firm. And, in fact, one of those firms, Perkins Coie, the ones challenging this in court, said as much to the judge, this would kill us. And the judge here in Washington has, for now, held off on the Trump executive action to strip Perkins Coie. But we'll see how long that protection lasts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this has knock=on affects for others seeking legal services but also, as you said, makes them hard to just function.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Especially the stripping of security clearances, Margaret. That makes it harder for a whistleblower at the FBI, or the CIA, or the Pentagon to find a lawyer to blow the whistle. It makes it possible such whistles will not be blown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they need to seek counsel who have ability to deal with classified information.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Camilo, the administration announced Friday they're revoking legal status of half a million migrants who came here legally from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela during President Biden's term. This is another fight they wanted to have. But if the intention - the stated intention is to go after the worst of the worst and deport them, why focus on people who bothered to be here legally?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Well, the administration would argue that the Biden administration abused its immigration executive authority to create this program without Congress and that the people who came here under this policy are undercutting American workers and that they are essentially illegal immigrants as well. And now they are turning them into illegal immigrants by stripping them of their legal status, their work permits, their deportations protection. Right now they have, for the next 30 days, a chance to self-deport through a smartphone app. If they don't do that, DHS is warning that they will be found, arrested and deported from the country.",
      "And this crackdown on immigration by the administration is also extending to other parts of the immigration system. We also know that the administration is suspending funding \u2013 federal funding for legal services providers and lawyers to help - who help migrant children, who have left federal custody, or who are still in federal custody and who are facing deportation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is all intentional, the taking funding away, even from migrant kids?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes, this administration does not believe that federal funds should be used for people who are in the country illegally or without legal permission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, you're going to be busy. Thank you for breaking it all down for us. I appreciate it.",
      "MACFARLANE: Thank you.",

      "Through a summons to juvenile court, the accused student was charged with intimidation based on bigotry and bias in the first and second degree, according to the Waterbury Police Department.",
      "The March 3 incident happened inside the girls' locker room during a gym period on March 3, said Police said in a statement that investigators probing the March 3 incident \"determined that the altercation was motivated by religion and/or ethnicity, meeting the definition of a hate crime.\" They also said the classification was reviewed and confirmed by the Waterbury State's Attorney's Office.",
      "Another 13-year-old student accused in the altercation was referred to a youth diversionary program instead of being arrested, according to police, \"based on her involvement in the incident.\" Police said their investigation included interviews with students and staff at the school \"who were present or otherwise involved\" in the incident.",
      "The students' names were not released by authorities.",
      "According to\u00a0the Connecticut chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations, the students were targeted for wearing hijabs.",
      "CAIR's chair Farhan Memon told CBS News the sisters, who started attending classes at Wallace in October and do not speak fluent English, had faced taunting and threatening behavior from the accused students before.",
      "On the day of the alleged assault, Memon said the accused student grabbed the sisters from behind in the locker room and pulled off their hijabs. One Muslim student was punched in the face and suffered bruises and a black eye. The other emerged from the altercation with a cut across her neck, which apparently came from a sharp object that has not been explicitly identified, according to Memon. CBS News reviewed images of the students' injuries.",
      "Police characterized the twins' injuries as minor. They did not require immediate medical treatment at the scene of the attack, according to police, but CAIR noted in a news release that the injuries were \"severe enough to require treatment at a hospital.\" The organization, which advocates for Muslim civil rights and against Islamophobia in the U.S., called the attack \"brutal\" in a March 12 post on\u00a0Facebook.",
      "\"The parents of the victims sought CAIR's assistance because they felt that they were not receiving sufficient communication from the school regarding disciplinary actions against the perpetrators or a clear plan to ensure their daughters' safety,\" the organization said.",
      "The Waterbury Department of Education has now acknowledged the incident as an act of bullying, police said, adding that education officials have \"taken disciplinary action, and implemented enhanced school safety measures in response to the incident.\"",
      "\"While this was not part of a widespread problem, this is an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to ensure our students are safe and respectful of one another,\" said Darren Schwartz, interim superintendent of Waterbury Public Schools, in a statement.",
      "Memon, however, told CBS News he believes this kind of bullying is a systemic problem in Waterbury and said he has raised that concern with the city's mayor.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 08:26:35 -0400",
    "summary": "Susann Sills had posted a topless photo in a political chatroom that enraged her husband, Dr. Eric Scott Sills, according to prosecutors.",
    "story": [
      "Susann Sills was no shrinking violet, says her friend Chris Solimine. They had met while both earned an MBA at the University of Miami. \u00a0\"Susann was ... smart, witty, sarcastic, but not in a mean way... just enough to dig at you,\" he said.\u00a0 \"Incredibly driven, a loyal friend.\"",
      "And she was an accomplished businesswoman. Together with her husband, Dr. Eric \"Scott\" Sills, a renowned fertility specialist, they had started their own IVF practice in April 2015. \"She started the business ... she built it,\" Solimine said, adding, \"Susann pretty much ran everything with the exception of actually doing the procedures.\"",
      "So, it came as a shock when he read the news that Susann Sills had suddenly died on Nov. 13, 2016, from an apparent accidental fall. \"It didn't seem plausible to me that she just fell down the stairs with a migraine headache,\" Solimine said. But that was the story Dr. Sills had told the 911 operator that morning when he called and reported finding his wife face down on the staircase. Solimine says he wondered if there was more to the story.",
      "Rick Leeds, another friend of Susann Sills, said she had left him a troubling message about a month before her death. \"She sounded like she was whispering,\" Leeds said. \"It was so different from the happy, jovial, excited voicemails I got before. This one was definitely ... things weren't good.\" When they spoke, Leeds said it sounded like there was tension over a photo.\u00a0 \"She said it was a topless photo of her that had appeared on a ... blog.\"\u00a0 As it turned out, the topless photo was one that Susann Sills had posted of herself on a political chatroom called Patrick.net.",
      "\"Susann apparently was one of the few women who was involved in this forum,\" according to former Orange County Sheriff's Homicide Detective Dave Holloway, who was the lead case agent. \"She ... kind of threw out on this forum that ... if Donald Trump won the presidential nomination, that she would post a picture of her bare breasts,\" Holloway said.",
      "Leeds says that when he and Susann Sills spoke, it was clear that, \"She and Scott were in a really rocky place, and that she was thinking about leaving him.\" He adds, \"Whatever was going on between her and Scott ... and this picture ... was just ... a pivotal point for her.\"",
      "But Holloway and his team had no idea about the photo or what, if any, significance it had on Susann Sills' death when they arrived at the Sills' San Clemente home.",
      "\"Susann had injuries to pretty much her whole body,\" said Holloway. \"Her face was all bruised up. Her back was bruised up ... both arms and legs ... had bruising and abrasions.\"",
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Tracy Smith asked, \"At that point in time that morning November 13th, was Scott Sills a victim or a suspect?\"",
      "\"To us ... he was a victim,\" Holloway said. \"We were going to a house where two kids and a husband just lost their wife and mother.\" But as they continued their investigation, the questions would mount.",
      "Smith goes inside the investigation in an encore of\u00a0\"The Puzzling Death of Susann Sills,\" airing Saturday at 10/9c* on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. (*basketball delay in the east and central time zones/)",
      "Detectives interviewed the couple's 12-year-old twins, Mary-Katherine and Eric Sills. Everyone described the marriage as \"loving.\" The children said their parents rarely fought and were never violent. And they all confirmed that Susann Sills had been suffering from a migraine all weekend. Mary-Katherine, whose room was the quietest, said she had cleaned and tidied it up to look like a hotel suite so that her mom could rest, while Mary-Katherine slept in her parents' bedroom.",
      "In his 911 call, Scott Sills said his wife's shoe had come off on the stairs, suggesting she had gotten up in the middle of the night, tripped and fell. A collection of items around Susann Sills' body seemed to support the story of an accidental fall. There was a large stainless-steel cooking pot, which seemed odd at first, but Susann Sills' family had explained she would sometimes carry a bowl when she felt nauseated. And there was an empty bottle of Tramadol, a pain medication, which Scott Sills said Susann Sills often took to treat her migraines. And off to the side was a red and white scarf. Mary-Katherine told investigators her mother had been wearing it around her neck when she was discovered in the morning. But she had taken it off so as not to impede her mother's breathing.",
      "During a preliminary examination of Susann Sills' injuries, the deputy coroner had noticed some other injuries to her neck that didn't appear to be consistent with a fall. \u00a0\"Her neck had a pretty pronounced ligature mark,\" Holloway said,",
      "Smith asked, \"Is it possible that she could have fallen down the stairs and then somehow the scarf strangled her?\"",
      "\"Could have caught on a banister ... sure, I suppose so,\" Holloway said, \"but we didn't have any evidence of that.\"",
      "Instead, investigators say, they found something suspicious. There was blood in Mary-Katherine's room where Susann Sills had been staying that night, on the curtains, the wall, and the nightstand. And they discovered that Scott Sills, who had been wearing a beanie on his head, had a cut on his head, and a bruise on his forearm. He said he had injured himself while working on his car with his son Eric. Meanwhile Eric told the detectives he'd heard his parents arguing in the early hours of the morning. Scott Sills admitted he had argued with Susann, but said it was because he was upset that she was working late on her laptop, which aggravated her migraines.",
      "Smith asked, \"When you came to the house, it was a death investigation...By the time you left, was it a murder investigation?",
      "\"No,\" said Holloway, \"It wasn't just as clear-cut as that.\"",
      "DNA tests on the blood in the bedroom eventually came back positive for Scott Sills, with a smudge on the wall that showed a mixture of both Scott and Susann's DNA. \"They were both there,\" said Holloway, \"There's a fight.\" And forensic analysis of Susann's phone suggested there was tension in the marriage. In texts sent in late August, less than three months before her death, Susann wrote, \"I am trapped\" ... \"You are killing me\" ... \"I just want out\" and \"We just aren't right for each other.\"",
      "In November 2017, a year after her death, the coroner's office cited Susann Sills' cause of death as ligature strangulation, and the manner as homicide. Dr. Sills was now the prime suspect.",
      "When investigators interviewed Scott Sills again in August 2018, he denied killing Susann Sills, and for the first time he offered an explanation for the blood in Mary-Katherine's room. He said he'd cut himself while changing a window screen.",
      "But on the day of Susann Sills' death, detectives had found something else -- a possible motive. In Scott Sills' home office was a printout of an online exchange between Susann Sills and a male member of Patrick.net dated Aug. 30, 2016. They were discussing that topless photo Susann Sills had posted. The man, who went by \"tenpoundbass\" wrote: \"All I've got to say is you must have a super cool Husband.\" Susann, aka \"turtledove\" replied, \"He's exhausted, actually. It isn't easy being married to a woman who is partially naked and posing, alluringly, all the time ...\"",
      "Scott Sills had denied printing the chat. But investigators had later found a copy of the same exchange on his phone.",
      "\"Does this sound like this could lead to motive?\" asked Smith.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Holloway. \"If it's ... something that's building up in him, some kind of anger ... or jealousy about ... what his wife's doing online without him.\"",
      "\"Enough to kill her?\" asked Smith. \"Mm-hmm,\" Holloway replied.",
      "In April 2019, Dr. Scott Sills was arrested on his way to surgery and charged with the alleged murder of his wife.",
      "At his trial in late 2023, Sills' defense attorney Jack Earley argued there was no motive for murder. And that topless photo? He told Smith, \"It wasn't a big deal.\"",
      "\"It's not striking to you that he had this photo in two places on his phone and then on the printer?\" she asked. \"No,\" he said. \"First of all, I don't know really who printed this stuff up.\"",
      "And Earley offered a unique theory to explain how the forensic pathologist could have found ligature strangulation. He said one or both of the family's dogs had tugged on the scarf that was wrapped around Susann's neck after she fell on the stairs.",
      "\"Mary-Kate ... saw the dogs pulling on the scarf,\" Earley told Smith.",
      "\"Do you honestly think that the dogs pulled hard enough to strangle her to death?\" Smith asked.",
      "\"No,\" he said. \"That was not the main theory.\"",
      "Instead, Earley focused on another injury identified in Susann's autopsy: a fractured C3 vertebra near the base of the neck, which can be fatal, or at least have left Susann incapacitated.",
      "\"Their breathing is compromised,\" Earley explained. \"If they're then choked, it doesn't take much to kill 'em.\"",

      "And the empty pill bottle was for a pain medication Scott Sills said his wife took to treat her migraines.",

      "Tracy Smith: So Eric is right next (to) Mary-Katherine's room \u2026 where his mom was.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Yeah.",
      "Tracy Smith: And what did he tell you he heard?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Well, he heard loud voices arguing, but \u2026 he didn't describe hearing any physical confrontation.",
      "Eric Sills told detectives that after about five minutes he decided to go to sleep in the main bedroom with his sister. According to Mary-Katherine's statement, she thought he'd come in around 3:40 a.m. and told her their parents were arguing about a work email.",
      "DETECTIVE: How do you know she \u2014 she got an email?",
      "MARY-KATHERINE SILLS: Because Eric said they were talking about that.",
      "DETECTIVE: Oh, OK. So Eric told you that she got an email and that she was, it was about something \u2026",
      "MARY-KATHERINE SILLS: Something about work.",
      "Scott Sills told detectives he had argued with his wife because he found her working late on her laptop, which made her migraines worse.",
      "Tracy Smith: When you heard that they had an argument shortly before she was found at the bottom of the stairs dead, what was going through your mind?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Well, again that's \u2026 one more piece of data that we're gonna collect. \u2026 It doesn't mean one way or the other that it was a murder. But that's definitely an avenue that we would have to pursue.",
      "Neither Eric nor Mary-Katherine heard their dad return to the bedroom.",
      "MARY-KATHERINE SILLS: \u00a0I woke up and my dad was just like on the covers just laying there like there wasn't enough room to get in I guess. So, he was just laying there.",
      "DETECTIVE: On top of it?",
      "MARY-KATHERINE SILLS: Yeah.",
      "It was around 6:30 a.m. the next morning when Scott Sills and the twins woke up. He asked them if they wanted to go to the pool and get some doughnuts. Mary-Katherine said when she left the bedroom and looked over the banister, she saw her mom's body at the bottom of the stairs \u2014 that long red and white scarf around her neck.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: That was \u2026 Mary-Katherine's scarf \u2026 It was found in the same room as \u2026 Susann's body.",
      "Tracy Smith: But the scarf wasn't on her body?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: When we arrived, it was not. \u2026 Mary-Katherine told us that she had to remove the scarf. And she did that \u2026 not to impede mom's breathing.",
      "Adding to the mystery were the injuries to Susann Sills' neck the deputy coroner had noticed during a preliminary examination of the body earlier that morning.",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: Especially with the ligature mark across her neck \u2026 it just didn't make sense.",
      "Tracy Smith: Is it possible that she could have fallen down the stairs and then somehow the scarf strangled her?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Could have caught on a banister \u2026 sure I suppose so, but we didn't have any evidence of that.",
      "As detectives continued their investigation, the questions mounted.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did anybody in the house hear a fall down the stairs?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: No. Nobody described hearing a fall down the stairs. Or, if Susann had been carrying that \u2026 stainless steel pot, no one heard that bounce down the stairs or land on the tile floor.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: There was no evidence on the stairs of someone going down, uh, like broken baluster or anything like that.",
      "And something else the detectives thought was strange.",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: \u00a0It was a warm day even though it was November. But when we spoke with Scott, and during the whole time we were \u2026 in the house doing our investigation, he was wearing a beanie over his head. \u2026 And he said that he slept with it 'cause it was cold.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did you ask him to remove the beanie?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: Yes.",
      "As it turned out, Susann wasn't the only one with injuries that morning.",
      "BLOOD FOUND IN A BEDROOM",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: We discovered that Scott had some injuries \u2026 He had \u2026 a \u2026 cut up here on his forehead. \u2026 and on his arm, he had \u2026 a bruise.",
      "Scott Sills said there was a simple explanation for the injuries. He had hurt himself while working on his car in the garage with his son, Eric. There was just one problem.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Eric told us dad didn't hurt himself.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did he say to you, I left the garage so maybe he hurt himself while I was gone?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: No. He told us they came in the house together.",
      "And investigators said they found something Scott Sills couldn't explain on that day.",
      "Tracy Smith: You found blood?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: Yes.",
      "Blood in Mary-Katherine's room \u2014 where Susann Sills had been staying \u2014 on the curtains, the wall, and the nightstand.",
      "Tracy Smith: So, that morning when you asked Scott about the blood, what did he say?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: He didn't know where it came from. \u2026 He was unaware of it.",
      "Mary-Katherine told investigators the room was \"perfect\" when she left it. She also said she'd turned down the bed, but now it was made.",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: It didn't really make sense. \u2026 Why would Susann \u2026 take the time to make the bed in the middle of the night?",
      "Tracy Smith: So if you found blood in Mary-Katherine's bedroom, you know that there are ligature marks on Susann \u2026 why not take him down to the station at this point and question him?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Once you arrest somebody \u2026 that starts processes that \u2026 you can't stop. \u2026 Besides the blood in the bedroom \u2026 we didn't really have \u2026 enough evidence of a fight occurring. \u2026 So, at the end of the day, there wasn't enough probable cause legally to arrest him.",
      "Susann Sills' autopsy four days later didn't provide any definitive answers.",
      "The forensic pathologist noted that Susann Sills had injuries all over her body that could have resulted from a fall, including a fractured C3 vertebra near the base of her neck, which can be fatal. Then there was that ligature mark across her neck and hemorrhaging of the blood vessels in her eyes, which pointed to strangulation. It would take months to make an official ruling.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: It's \u2026 not something they wanna rush into. It's not something they wanna make a rash judgment on. \u2026 The doctor \u2026 wanted to examine the whole case more clearly.",
      "In the meantime, detectives requested DNA testing on evidence collected from the Sills home, and forensic analysis on Susann Sills' phone and laptop. They also dug deeper into who the Sills were.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: None of their immediate neighbors knew anything about the family. \u2026",

      "Sandi Roberts: He was something we had never seen before. In a small town in Tennessee at that age \u2026 He was very special.",
      "Jamie Aikens: He was hilarious \u2026 How many people come to class in a three-piece suit \u2026 and it's not dress-up day.",
      "Sandi Roberts: He's flamboyant. He's bigger than life. \u2026 He was very, very kind.",
      "Jamie Aikens: I grew up, uh, pretty poor, I didn't have a car in high school or anything like that and a lot of times no lunch money. \u2026 And he always pulled out his wallet and paid for it. It just wasn't a question.",
      "His future seemed limitless. He was accepted to both law school and medical school.",
      "Sandi Roberts: We were kind of all \u2026 on the edge of our seat, wondering what he was going to decide to do.",

      "But soon, Solimine says, they were a couple.",
      "Chris Solimine: She started talking about Dr. Sills after she had told me she was getting divorced \u2026 and that she was now dating him. \u2026 I just remember her saying \u2026 he's a \u2026 brilliant doctor.",
      "Scott Sills, who was also coming out of a previous marriage, seemed to have met his match.",

      "Susann Arsuaga fit right in at Scott's 20th high school reunion.",
      "Sandi Roberts: She danced the whole time. \u2026 They were lovely together. \u2026 \u00a0He just seemed really \u2026 happy.",
      "The couple married and welcomed twins through IVF, adding to Dr. Sills' two older kids. And eventually, Susann Sills' business acumen would lead them to start their own IVF practice in April 2015.",
      "Chris Solimine: She started the business \u2026 She built it. \u2026 Susann pretty much ran everything with the exception of actually doing the procedures.",

      "But about a month before her death, Rick Leeds, another of Susann Sills' friends, says she left him a troubling message.",
      "Rick Leeds: She sounded like she was whispering \u2026 It was so different from the happy, jovial, excited voicemails I got before. This one was definitely \u2026 things weren't good.",
      "When they spoke, Leeds says it sounded like there was tension over a photo.",
      "Rick Leeds: She said it was a topless photo of her that had appeared on a \u2026 blog. \u2026 this was some discussion she didn't wanna have.",

      "Det. Dave Holloway: I would describe him as emotionless. \u2026 He never \u2026 acted as though Susann was even his wife \u2026 He talked about what a good manager she was and how she kept \u00a0\u2026 their business flowing. \u2026 But he never once mentioned that she was a good mother or that he loved her \u2026",

      "Rick Leeds: All of a sudden, there started to be another woman in photos, and he was out on dates and they were going around town.",
      "The behavior raised eyebrows, but it was hardly evidence. Then, in November 2017, a year after Susann Sills' death, there was finally news from the coroner's office: Susann's cause of death was cited as ligature strangulation and the manner a homicide.",
      "Dr. Sills was now the prime suspect. DNA results on the blood in Mary-Katherine's room showed a mixture of his and Susann's DNA.",

      "Det. Dave Holloway: There was one in particular where she \u2026 had some pretty strong words towards Scott.",
      "In texts sent in late August, less than three months before her death, Susann Sills wrote, \"I am trapped\"... \"You are killing me\"... \"I just want out\" and \"We just aren't right for each other.",

      "And on the day of her death, detectives had found a printout in Dr. Sills' home office of an exchange between Susann and another Patrick.net member from Aug. 30, 2016, discussing the photo.

      "THE DEFENSE OFFERS A UNIQUE THEORY",
      "In November 2023, just over seven years after Susann Sills' death, Scott Sills \u2013 now stripped of his medical license \u2014 went on trial for her murder. The Orange County District Attorney's Office declined our request for an interview, but cameras were allowed in court for portions of the trial where Senior Deputy D.A. Jennifer Walker laid out her case to the jury.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER (in court): November 13th of 2016 \u2026 this man killed his wife and hid it.",
      "Walker argued that Scott Sills beat, and then strangled, Susann Sills to death before staging the scene to make it look like she had fallen down the stairs.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER (in court): This is a murder, not an accident.",
      "The prosecution's case relied heavily on Susann Sills' autopsy. But Scott Sills' defense attorney, Jack Earley, came to court armed with a unique theory. He suggested that Susann fell \u2014 either going up or down \u2014 the stairs and that one or both of the family dogs then tugged on the scarf that was wrapped around her neck.",
      "Tracy Smith: Do you honestly think that the dogs pulled hard enough to strangle her to death?",
      "Jack Earley: No, no \u2014 I didn't. That was not the main theory that the dogs actually strangled her to death.",
      "Instead, Earley focused on another injury identified in Susann Sills' autopsy: that fractured C3 vertebra. He says that injury is consistent with a fall, and that it would have left Susann incapacitated.",
      "Jack Earley: Let's assume that someone trips and falls and fractures their C3 \u2026 their breathing is compromised. If they're then choked, it doesn't take much to kill 'em.",
      "The defense had the scarf tested for dog DNA and it came back positive. And there was testimony that the dogs were known to play tug-of-war. as seen in this video. And when Susann and Scott Sills' now-19-year-old daughter Mary-Katherine took the stand for the prosecution, her testimony supported the defense's theory. Investigator Dave Holloway was at the trial.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Mary-Katherine testified that she \u2026 saw the dogs pulling at the scarf around her neck. And none of that came up during\u2014the\u2014the day we interviewed her the first time.",
      "Tracy Smith: How did that strike you?",
      "Det Dave Holloway: Well, (sighs), um, I know that she was still close with her father \u2026",
      "Tracy Smith: Do you think she's trying to protect her dad?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: I would say so.",
      "Earley denies that. He says the reason Mary-Katherine didn't tell investigators is simple.",
      "Jack Earley: It wasn't asked. \u2026 Why would she think the dogs were important? She doesn't even know that \u2026 there's any question of being choked.",
      "He says Scott Sills did tell first-responders. And he argued that Susann Sills' toxicology tests point to an accidental fall. She had a muscle relaxant and pain medication in her system. And Earley told the jury that Susann suffered from a fainting disorder and that vertigo would accompany her migraines. But the prosecution said the defense's theory just doesn't make sense.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER (in court): Strangulation is a silent killer. You know what's not a silent killer? Falling down multiple stairs \u2026 You have to believe she bounced her head, neck, back, shoulders, inside of her arms, legs and feet, multiple ways against approximately six stairs. Like being in a soundproof pinball machine. \u2026 Then was strangled by her dogs. Not reasonable.",
      "And why would Susann Sills have a scarf around her neck that early in the morning to begin with? Prosecutors suggested that Scott Sills used it to strangle her and then left it around her neck to cover the marks. But Earley told the jury it wasn't unusual for Susann to wear a scarf, especially when she wasn't feeling well.",
      "Jack Earley: Because if she got sick, that was something that she would wear \u2014 a scarf to wipe \u2026 your mouth with it.",
      "But the prosecution also pointed out that Susann and Scott Sills' son Eric told investigators he saw his\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  mother put the dogs away in their crate in the hours before she died.",
      "Tracy Smith: Eric said that his mom put the dogs in the crate.",
      "Jack Earley: Yes. \u2026 Sometimes, dogs, when they're crate-trained, when they go to bed, will go lay in the crate, even with the door open.",
      "There was also no blood on the stairs or damage to them.",
      "Tracy Smith: There are all these injuries that you say come from the fall down the stairs, all over her body, but she leaves no marks on the stairs.",
      "Jack Earley: But there's no marks anywhere in the house \u2026",
      "But there was that blood in Mary-Katherine's bedroom, and the prosecution argued it was evidence that a fight occurred. A forensic scientist testified that the stains on the nightstand and drapes were consistent with Scott Sills' DNA. Earley did acknowledge that his client's blood was in the room, but he told the jury about Scott's claim that he hurt himself there on an earlier date.",
      "Tracy Smith: From Scott replacing a screen?",
      "Jack Earley: Yeah. From getting cut on a nail that was in the back of \u2026 the nightstand that was there.",
      "That forensic scientist though testified that one of the stains on the wall was a mixture of DNA\u2014and Scott and Susann Sills were likely contributors. Earley says that doesn't mean it was Susann's blood and that it could have been her touch DNA that was picked up.",
      "Jack Earley: Susann had touched that area before at some point in time. And she lived there.",
      "But the prosecution pointed out that there were also clumps of Susann Sills' hair found in Mary-Katherine's room, and there were blood stains on Susann's clothing that were found to be consistent with Scott Sills' DNA, too. Earley had a rebuttal to it all, starting with the hair.",
      "Jack Earley: She has hair extensions. And you know what hair extensions cause? Loss of hair. \u2026",
      "And the blood on the clothes?",
      "Jack Earley: You don't know how old it is.",
      "The jury was also shown pictures of those injuries that were observed on Scott Sills. Remember how he told investigators that he hurt himself while working on his car with his son? And how, according to investigators, Eric Sills said that his father didn't get injured? Well, when Eric Sills took the stand, his testimony allowed for the possibility.",
      "Jack Earley: What he testified is, well, I didn't stay there the whole time he fixed the car. \u2026",
      "Tracy Smith: Does that seem like a discrepancy to you?",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance allegedly discussed the details of a highly sensitive operation to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Goldberg wrote on Monday.",
      "As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.",
      "The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Goldberg told CBS News, \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday afternoon, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly classified information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",

You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",

      "What is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?",

      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.",
      "Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "But in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Ahead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.",
      "In his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"",
      "China has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",

    "summary": "South Korea's Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, but didn't rule on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
    "story": [
      "South Korea's Constitutional Court on Monday overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating the nation's No. 2 official as acting leader, while not yet ruling on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "Many observers said Monday's ruling doesn't signal much on the upcoming verdict on Yoon, as Han wasn't a key figure in Yoon's martial law imposition. But it could still embolden Yoon's staunch supporters and ramp up their political offensive on the opposition.",
      "Han became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly over his Dec. 3 imposition of martial law that triggered a massive political crisis. But Han was impeached by the assembly as well in late December following political strife with opposition lawmakers.",
      "The unprecedented, successive impeachments that suspended the country's top two officials intensified a domestic division and deepened worries about the country's diplomatic and economic activities. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, had since serving as acting president.",
      "On Monday, seven of the court's eight justices overturned or dismissed Han's impeachment. They ruled the accusations against him weren't against the law or weren't serious enough to remove him from office or his impeachment motion didn't even met a required quorum when it passed thorough the assembly. One justice upheld Han's impeachment.",
      "Dismissing Han would have needed the support of at least six court justices.",
      "Following his reinstatement, Han told reporters he would focus on the \"most urgent matters,\" including a fast-changing global trade environment, in an apparent reference to the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies. He also called for a national unity, saying \"there's no left or right \u2014 what matters is the advancement of our nation.\"",
      "The court has yet to rule on Yoon's impeachment. If the court upholds Yoon's impeachment, South Korea must hold a election for a new president. If it rules for him, Yoon will be restored to office and regain his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon was impeached about two weeks earlier than Han. Observers earlier predicted the Constitutional Court would rule on Yoon's case in mid-March but it hasn't done so.",
      "Yoon has been separately arrested and charged with rebellion in connection with his martial law decree. If convicted of that charge, he would face the death penalty or a life sentence. On March 8, Yoon was released from prison, after a Seoul district court allowed him to stand his criminal trial without being detained.",
      "Massive rival rallies backing Yoon or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea. Earlier surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans were critical of Yoon's martial law enactment, but those supporting or sympathizing with Yoon have later gained strength.",
      "At the center of squabbling over Yoon is why he sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after declaring martial law. Yoon says he aims to maintain order, but senior military and police officers sent there have said that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent a floor vote to overturn his decree. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter an assembly hall and voted it down unanimously.",
      "Han, a career diplomat who was appointed by Yoon, had attempted to reassure diplomatic partners and stabilize markets, when he served as acting president. A major trigger for the opposition's push for his impeachment was Han's refusal to fill three vacancies on the nine-member Constitutional Court bench.",
      "Restoring the court's full membership was sensitive because a ruling upholding Yoon's impeachment requires support from at least six justices.",
      "Han's successor, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant.",
      "Both Han and Choi cited needing bipartisan consent to add justices to the court, but their critics suspected they were siding with Yoon's People Power Party, which wanted to increase Yoon's chances of returning to power. On Friday, the main liberal opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted an impeachment motion on Choi.",

A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.",
      "Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade.",
      "The Trump administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador last weekend aboard those three flights. U.S. officials have said 137 of them were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.",
      "Documents obtained by CBS News showed that at least one of the men deported, a 26-year-old barber from Venezuela, has no criminal record in the U.S., and Venezuelan officials said he has no record there either.",
      "Maduro's government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.",
      "In recent weeks, some 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",

The fighting killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.",

      "Almost immediately, the researchers started seeing things that humans had never laid eyes on before.",
      "\"The first thing we saw was a huge sponge with a crab on it,\" Esquete said. \"That's already quite amazing, because one question that we had is 'Will there be any life at all?'\"",

      "Dunzello said her flight was diverted to Canada, and she expected it to refuel and return to New York.",

The legislation includes provisions for a 500 billion euro investment in infrastructure over a 12 year period, aimed at shoring up both the country's flagging economy.",
      "The package exempts from the national debt rules all spending on defense and security, including assistance to Ukraine, over 1% of GDP. The package of reforms, passed earlier in the week by the lower house of parliament, garnered the requisite two-thirds majority of votes in both parliamentary chambers to advance, and is now virtually guaranteed to become law. The plans mark a turning point after years of underinvestment and hesitation in German defense policy, and a fundamental reimagining of the country's role in European and global security.",
      "Merz's proposal envisions major arms deals, including to obtain new fighter jets, and expanded military aid for Ukraine.",
      "At the heart of the incoming leader's strategy is a commitment to spend \"whatever it takes\" on defense. Merz, who will most likely be inaugurated at the beginning of April and then tasked immediately with forming a new coalition government with other parties, has brokered a deal with two likely coalition members to raise hundreds of billions of euros in new defense spending with a focus on two key areas:",
      "First is the plan to create the 500 billion euro special fund for infrastructure projects and to change the strict \"debt brake\" rules to allow defense spending above 1% of GDP. Merz has argued it's essential, \"considering the dangers to our liberty and peace on the continent.\"",
      "The other key aspect of Merz's spending plan is an additional 3 billion euros worth of military aid for Ukraine. The commitment would build on Germany's existing support, which has included deliveries of IRIS-T air defense systems, Patriot missiles, Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Leopard tanks, and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.",
      "Can Merz make good on his defense spending plans?",
      "There are questions about Germany's ability to follow through on Merz's ambitious proposals, especially given its history of consistently falling short of NATO's 2% GDP defense spending target. Germany actually met that 2% goal in 2024 for the first time since the 1990s, perhaps heralding a shift in its approach to defense policy.",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "Economic pressure, both domestic and global, could prove a significant obstacle to the spending plan's implementation. Germany's economy has struggled to recover since the coronavirus pandemic, and there are concerns about the impact of such massive spending increases on the country's fiscal stability.",
      "Christian Lindner, the nation's former finance minister, harshly criticized Merz's plan to boost defense spending and loosen the \"debt brake,\" warning that Germany could soon have \"a trillion euros in higher debt, without having been economically strengthened by it.\"",
      "But for Germany's relationship with the United States, a defense spending revolution \u2014 and even a clear commitment to one \u2014 could represent a turning point. Washington has long pressured Germany, and its other NATO allies, to take on a greater share of the fiscal and military burden of supporting the transatlantic defense alliance.",
      "President Trump has recently called for NATO members to spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, a significantly higher proportion than even the U.S. spends. He's also indicated that the U.S. could disregard the Article 5 collective defense clause in NATO's founding treaty, refusing to help defend allies that fail to meet his spending targets. His rhetoric has fueled the urgency behind Germany's military expansion plans.",
      "The planned increase in German defense spending could bolster NATO's deterrence capacity, particularly in Eastern Europe, where Russia's aggression has put member nations on edge.",
      "Germany has already committed to providing 35,000 troops and more than 200 ships and aircraft to help implement NATO's new force model, and additional funding could see those contributions enhanced.",
      "The success of Merz's initiative will be closely watched by Germany's allies. Failure to deliver on the ambitious plans could strain relations with the U.S. and other NATO partners as Western Europe tries to show a united front in the face of the threat from Russia.",

At least 58 people were killed in a third consecutive night of airstrikes up and down the Palestinian territory, bringing the death toll to an estimated 500 people since the ceasefire was shattered with Tuesday's shock pre-dawn Israeli missile barrages, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Ministry of Health.",
      "More than a dozen people were killed overnight in a strike on just one house, the home of the Mubarak family in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. They had gathered to mourn an earlier death. Survivors whisked the bodies of the dead to a hospital by ambulance and horse cart.",

      "Israel resumes ground operations in Gaza",
      "The Israel Defense Forces confirmed Tuesday that it had also resumed ground operations in central Gaza, again dividing the strip into north and south along the Netzarim corridor and blocking movement across the line. The IDF said it was also stationing a brigade of troops in the south, while airdropping fliers warning civilians to evacuate from areas around the entire Gaza border, which it warned would be turned back into combat zones.",
      "\"The IDF does not intend to harm you,\" a post by the IDF spokesman for Arab Media said on X. \"For your safety it is forbidden to approach IDF forces in the defensive zone and in any place where they are deployed.\"",
      "That message followed a severe threat from Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz to the citizens of Gaza.",
      "\"Residents of Gaza, this is a final warning,\" he said in a video broadcast Wednesday afternoon. \"If all the Israeli hostages are not released and Hamas is not eliminated from Gaza Israel will act with forces you have never known before. Take the advice of the U.S. President. Return the hostages and eliminate Hamas, and other options will open up for you \u2014 including going to other places in the world for those who wish. The alternative is complete destruction and devastation.\"",

      "The Houthis claimed Thursday that they had fired a \"hypersonic ballistic missile\" at Israel before dawn - the second claimed launch in three days. The group said it had attempted to hit Ben Gurion international airport south of Tel Aviv, and air raid alarms shattered the peace many Israelis had grown accustomed to during two months of the ceasefire at 4 a.m. across the city and central Israel.",
      "\"A missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the IAF (Israeli Air Force) prior to crossing into Israeli territory,\" the IDF said in a statement minutes after an all-clear was given. No damage was reported.",

      "The U.S. has responded to the Houthis' resumption of rocket launches with strikes against the group. Overnight, the U.S. struck targets in Yemen's capital of Sanaa, according to Houthi-run Al Masirah TV. At least nine women and children were wounded in a residential neighborhood, a spokesperson for the Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry claimed in a post on X.",

      "It has been a stellar week for Bach, who greeted Coventry and shared warm smiles after her acceptance speech.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 12:51:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Former U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad says the Taliban's decision to release American George Glezmann was \"a goodwill gesture\" to President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed Thursday that American national George Glezmann was on his way back to the U.S. after being released by Afghanistan's Taliban rulers. Glezmann, an Atlanta native, had been in custody after being detained by Taliban authorities while on a tourist visit to Afghanistan in December 2022.",
      "He had been deemed wrongfully detained by the U.S. government.",
      "Rubio thanked Qatar, saying the nation's \"steadfast commitment and diplomatic efforts were instrumental in securing George's release.\"",
      "His statement came after former U.S. government envoy to Afghanistan\u00a0Zalmay Khalilzad\u00a0posted a\u00a0statement on X\u00a0announcing Glezmann's release, which he called \"a goodwill gesture\" to President Trump by the Taliban.",
      "Mr. Trump, Khalilzad said, had \"made the freedom and homecoming of Americans held abroad a high priority.  It is an honor to assist in this important effort.\"",
      "\"George joins American Ryan Corbett and William McKenty, who were released from Afghanistan on the night of President Trump's inauguration and returned home to their families,\" Rubio said in his statement, adding: \"George's release is a positive and constructive step.\u00a0 It is also a reminder that other Americans are still detained in Afghanistan. President Trump will continue his tireless work to free ALL Americans unjustly detained around the world.\"",
      "Corbet and McKenty were released in January\u00a0in exchange for a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned in California on drug trafficking and terrorism charges.",
      "Before President Joe Biden left office, his administration had also been working on a deal to secure the release of Corbett, Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi, an Afghan-American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company and also went missing in 2022. The Taliban has denied holding Habibi.",
      "Since retaking control of Afghanistan following the U.S. military withdrawal in the summer of 2021, the Taliban movement has failed to gain international recognition as the country's rightful rulers. Most nations, including the U.S., have refused to engage in formal diplomatic relations due to the Taliban's draconian crackdown on human rights, which has seen the Islamic extremist group erase virtually every freedom granted to Afghan women and girls during the two decades of Western-backed governance.",
      "The Taliban regime has tried to show that, despite those domestic policies, it is aligned with the U.S. in its determination to rid Afghanistan of the threat posed by ISIS.",
      "A statement issued Thursday by Afghanistan's Taliban-run Ministry of Foreign Affairs called Glezmann's release \"a goodwill gesture, reflecting Afghanistan's readiness to genuinely engage all sides, particularly the United States of America, on the basis of mutual respect and interests.\"",
      "\"The end of conflict in Afghanistan, suppression of corrupt groups such as Daesh [ISIS], and no threat emanating from Afghanistan towards others, demonstrates that Afghanistan can play a positive role in regional and world stability, and is able to resolve its issues with the world on amicable terms,\" the statement said.",

    "summary": "The United States fell to its lowest-ever place on the World Happiness Report, released on International Day of Happiness, while Finland remained in the top spot.",
    "story": [
      "The United States this year fell to its lowest-ever place on the\u00a0World Happiness Report, an annual survey published on International Day of Happiness. The 2025 report highlights the positive effects benevolence and social connections have on people's life satisfaction.",
      "Finland remained the happiest nation for the eighth year in a row, while Mexico and Costa Rico ranked among the top 10 for the first time since the report was first published in 2012.",
      "This year's report ranks 147 countries by their happiness levels \u2014 based on a population's average assessment of their quality of life from 2022 to 2024. Data from the Gallup World Poll, which asks respondents to evaluate their current life, is the primary source for the annual happiness rankings.",
      "Researchers found that the belief in the kindness of others, as well as actively caring about and sharing with others, has strong effects on happiness, according to the report.",
      "\"Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth \u2014 it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back,\" Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup, said in a statement.",
      "U.S. ranks 24th, its lowest ranking",
      "The U.S. ranked 24th in the world, one place lower than its 2024 ranking. America previously peaked at 11th place in 2012.",
      "One factor highlighted in the report was the increasing number of people who eat alone.",
      "\"In 2023, roughly 1 in 4 Americans reported eating all of their meals alone the previous day \u2014 an increase of 53% since 2003,\" the report said. \"Dining alone has become more prevalent for every age group, but especially for young people.\"",
      "Data reviewed for the report indicates major differences in the rates of meal-sharing around the world, with sharing meals having a positive effect on wellbeing.",
      "Another factor contributing to America's drop in the rankings, as well as the rankings of some European countries, was \"the rise in political polarization and votes against 'the system,'\" the report said.",
      "\"The country-wide evolution of happiness and trust is highly associated with the rise in the likelihood of voting for anti-system parties in Western Europe and the United States,\" the authors wrote.",
      "Mexico, Costa Rica enter the top 10 for first time",
      "A key reason for the rise in Mexico and Costa Rica's rankings appeared to be family household size.",
      "\"Latin American societies, characterized by larger household sizes and strong family bonds, offer valuable lessons for other societies that seek higher and sustainable wellbeing,\" the report said.",
      "The report compared Mexico to European countries, explaining that even though it is poorer, \"larger households imply a potential advantage to build positive social interactions within the household, which could partially counterbalance the differences in income with Europe.\"",
      "In Europe, 23% of households were single-person, while in Mexico, only 11% were single-person, according to data cited in the report.",
      "\"In both Mexico and Europe, the highest average life satisfaction is reported by people who live in households with four to five members,\" the authors wrote. \"We also observe an inverted U-shaped relationship. Average life satisfaction is lower for people in single-person households as well as households with six or seven members.\"",
      "Dropped wallet experiment",
      "The Gallup World Poll asked people in 2019 if they thought others would return a lost wallet, and found that \"people are much too pessimistic about the benevolence of others.\"",
      "\"When wallets were dropped in the street by researchers, the proportion of returned wallets was far higher than people expected,\" the report said.",
      "The belief that others would return the lost wallets also contributed to a country's ranking.",
      "The Nordic nations, including Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, ranked in the top 10 countries and were among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the report said.",
      "\"The wallet data are so convincing because they confirm that people are much happier living where they think people care about each other,\" John F. Helliwell, an economist at the University of British Columbia and a founding editor of the World Happiness Report, said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Search efforts pressed on into their second week for Sudiksha Konanki, a college student at the University of Pittsburgh who went missing in early March during a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.",
      "Details surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.",
      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe returns to U.S. after facing questioning",
      "Riibe had been confined to a hotel in Punta Cana for more than a week as he faced questioning during the investigation, with officers escorting him anywhere he went. A judge in the Dominican Republic ruled on March 18 that Riibe should be freed from police surveillance.",
      "The law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, had pushed in legal documents for his freedom, given the absence of any criminal charge, which led to the hearing. In court, Riibe argued to the judge that he was detained inappropriately.",
      "\"I really want to go home and see my family,\" Riibe said. \"I understand I'm here to help but it's been 10 days.\"",
      "His attorneys said earlier that authorities had confiscated Riibe's passport. The judge's March 18 ruling did not include an immediate decision on the issue of returning Riibe's passport, but the next day, his attorneys said the La Altagracia Prosecutor's Office informed Riibe it was willing to return his passport.",
      "\"Although grateful for the decision of the Prosecutor's Office, Joshua decided, for privacy reasons, to request a new one at the United States Consulate, which was urgently issued to him,\" Riibe's attorneys said.",
      "He then returned home to the U.S. with his father, his attorneys said.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorneys while he still in Punta Cana.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",
      "\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching \u2026 because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"",
      "Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"",

      "Mexico's attorney general on Wednesday reported irregularities in an investigation by state authorities into an alleged\u00a0cartel killing site and training camp at a ranch in the western state of Jalisco where people searching for relatives found bones and hundreds of articles of clothing and other personal effects.",
      "The \"ranch of horror,\" as some local media have dubbed it, in the town of Teuchitlan, outside Guadalajara, was found by authorities in September 2024. Six months later, a so-called search collective found charred bone fragments and personal items, raising questions about the original investigation by the Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office.",
      "Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, whose office took over the investigation last week, said that investigators in Jalisco failed to register evidence and fingerprints and process vehicles found at the ranch, three of which were later stolen.",
      "He said local authorities didn't investigate the ownership of the ranch and failed to scientifically analyze locations at the ranch to understand if they were used as crematoriums. Investigators did not arrest local officials who have been linked to activities at the ranch, he said.",
      "The extensive evidence meant that the \"truth will come out\" about the grisly discovery at a ranch in the western state of Jalisco, Gertz Manero told a news conference.",
      "The United Nations Human Rights Office last week called for \"thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigations\" into the apparent crimes.",
      "Gertz Manero said federal prosecutors were also not alerted about the site, as is standard procedure, and cast blame on the state prosecutor's office despite the National Guard carrying out an operation at the site carried out last year. There is still not enough information to confirm if the ranch was used to cremate bodies or train cartel members, he added.",
      "The Jalisco Search Warriors group last week shared images that shocked many in a country that's long accustomed to stark news of cartel warfare, forced disappearances and government corruption. The images and videos showed dozens of shoes, piles of clothing and what appeared to be human bone fragments.",
      "Such collectives have long risked their lives to seek answers about what has happened to Mexico's 120,000 disappeared people in the face of rampant impunity.",
      "Vigils and protests took place over the weekend for the victims of the alleged site.",
      "On Monday, a video was circulated showing masked and heavily armed men who read a statement identifying themselves as the Jalisco New Generation cartel and questioning the motivations of the searchers.",
      "The Jalisco cartel was one of eight Latin American criminal organizations the U.S. government\u00a0designated foreign terrorist organizations\u00a0last month.",

      "A\u00a0mass grave\u00a0discovered last December in a suburb of Guadalajara with dozens of bags of dismembered body parts contained the remains of 24 people, authorities said. That same month, Mexican authorities said they recovered a total of\u00a031 bodies\u00a0from pits in Chiapas, a state plagued by cartel violence.",

      "She told Fox News Digital Cruise might be particularly wary about putting a new romance on display after his highly publicized relationship with ex-wife Katie Holmes, which ended in divorce in 2012. \u00a0The \"Top Gun\" star's previous marriages to Mimi Rogers and Nicole Kidman also played out under the glare of the spotlight.",
      "Relationship experts have pointed out that Cruise and de Armas share many similarities that could create a strong match. (Getty)",
      "\"Since his devastating and public split with Katie, he has kept a low profile when it comes to his personal life. However, his new relationship with Ana De Armas could be his big comeback into being in a celebrity power couple,\" Conti said.",
      "\"As a matchmaker in Beverly Hills for nearly 13 years, it is clear that Tom was gravely affected by the public nature of his relationship with Katie and was gun-shy and incredibly private with any other potential romances since the split back in 2012.\"",
      "\"The fact that he was seen publicly with Ana is a huge deal,\" Conti added. \"My celebrity clients know exactly how to keep their love lives under wraps if that is their desire. So, this is a clear indicator that he is feeling secure about the potential of this romance, though sources are saying that it is merely because they are in a film together.",
      "\"Even if they are simply working together, as a celebrity matchmaker, I believe this couple is incredibly compatible for a number of reasons and do think that this could be a lasting Hollywood match if they give it a chance to blossom.\"",
      "Cruise and Holmes' highly publicized marriage ended in 2012.\u00a0 (KMazur/WireImage)",
      "Conti's view was shared by Damona Hoffman of \"The Dates & Mates,\" who pointed out several similarities between Cruise and de Armas that could draw them together as a couple.",
      "\"Both are talented, high-energy actors who thrive in action-packed roles. Their dedication to their craft could make them understand and support each other\u2019s demanding careers,\" she said.",
      "Hoffman said Cruise and de Armas also share other traits in common, noting the two are both \"adventurous\" and \"driven.\"",
      "\"The fact that he was seen publicly with Ana is a huge deal.\"",
      "\"Tom is known for his passion for extreme stunts and adventure, while Ana has shown a bold and ambitious approach to her career,\" she said. \"Their shared drive could create a strong connection.\"",
      "Conti also noted the pair \"both love working in the action-film space.\" Cruise is one of Hollywood's biggest action stars, appearing in dozens of movies within the genre and has led the \"Mission Impossible\" franchise since 1996.",
      "De Armas has starred in several action films, but the duo haven't appeared in any films together \u2013 yet.",
      "\"Tom is known for being hands-on even by doing his own stunts, something that Ana has expressed admiration for in the past,\" Conti said. \u00a0\"Ana too deep dives into whichever role she is engaging with, and their passion and dedication for the action genre is an exciting compatibility indicator.\"",
      "De Armas has praised Cruise for performing his daring stunts. (Paramount\u00a0)",
      "During a 2023 interview, de Armas, who rose to fame with the 2019 mystery film \"Knives Out,\" heaped praise on Cruise as she discussed what motivated her to take on action roles.",
      "\"It\u2019s demanding and painful, and your body is hurting everywhere, but it\u2019s also very rewarding as I saw myself getting better at it,\" she told USA Today. \"Besides, it\u2019s fun. And if I just go say my lines and someone else does the stunts, I\u2019m missing that fun.\"",
      "While speaking with the outlet, de Armas acknowledged she was \"not at a Tom Cruise level yet.\"",
      "\"But I can appreciate what he does 100% now, and I totally get why he does it. He\u2019s so mind-blowing,\" she said.",
      "Conti pointed out Cruise and de Armas both paved their own ways to success in the entertainment industry, another commonality that could bring them together.",
      "\"They both worked their way through Hollywood with strong work ethic and tenacity. Unlike many of the stars in this generation, Tom is not a nepo-baby and built his career for himself without the help of famous parents,\" she said. \"Ana is originally from Cuba and had the challenge of breaking into the English-based industry.\"",
      "De Armas has also appeared in several action movies. (Nina Westervelt/Variety via Getty Images)",
      "Hoffman told Fox News Digital that while de Armas and Cruise have high-profile careers, they \"both manage to balance charm and mystery.\"",
      "\"Ana keeps her personal life low key (hello new home in Vermont!), which might appeal to Tom, who values discretion despite his fame,\" she said.",
      "Last year, de Armas left Hollywood behind and moved into a new home in rural Vermont. During a September 2024 interview with E! News, the actress explained what prompted her to relocate.",
      "\"Their shared drive could create a strong connection.\"",
      "\"I feel like, nowadays, we all want to go away from the craziness of the world,\" she said. \"We all want to have the chance to build your own safe space. I\u2019ve made that decision myself.\"",

      "\"I found a home where I really feel off the grid,\" she added. \"I can collect myself and only bring there who I want to be with. I have my little cocoon there.\"",
      "Like Cruise, de Armas also previously had several public romances. Her former partners include Ben Affleck, Spanish actor Marc Clotet and Tinder executive Paul Boukadakis.",
      "However, the actress previously admitted to Elle magazine the \"horrible\" attention on her relationship with Affleck, whom she dated from 2020 to 2021, was a factor in her decision to flee Hollywood.",
      "\"That's one of the reasons why I left LA. Going through it confirmed my thoughts about, 'This is not the place for me to be,'\" she said in 2022. \"It became a little bit too much. There's no escape. There's no way out. ... It's always the feeling of something that you don't have, something missing. It's a city that keeps you anxious.\"",
      "Affleck and de Armas dated from 2020 to 2021. (BG004/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)",
      "Hoffman told Fox News Digital de Armas' aversion to the scrutiny that comes with dating an A-lister could spell trouble for a potential relationship with Cruise.",
      "\"Ana de Armas ended her relationship with Ben Affleck partly because she didn\u2019t want the intense Hollywood spotlight and LA lifestyle, two things that are even more inescapable with Tom Cruise, making a similar fate highly likely,\" she said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Also, Ana's star is poised for a meteoric rise and, while Tom is still doing his own stunts now, there will likely come a time in the not-to-distant future when he's going to need to step back from that kind of hectic, demanding acting work. And I imagine he'd resent seeing his partner shine brighter in her career than him.\"",
      "According to Hoffman, their different beliefs might be another stumbling block, citing Cruise's devotion to Scientology.",
      "The actor has been a Scientologist for over 30 years, and he is one of the religion's most prominent advocates.",
      "\"Tom\u2019s deep ties to Scientology have reportedly played a role in his past relationships ending,\" Hoffman said. \"Ana, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t shown any interest in that world, which could be a major disconnect.\"",
      "Despite several differences, Conti believes that Cruise could be \"the one\" for de Armas. (Getty)",
      "While some may assume de Armas and Cruise's 26-year age difference could be another obstacle, Conti told Fox News Digital she didn't believe it would have much of an effect.",
      "\"There was a 16-year age gap with Ben Affleck, so Ana is no stranger to an age-gap relationship with an actor,\" she said.",
      "\"This is Hollywood, and while civilians may raise their eyebrows at a 26-year age gap, this is par for the course here,\" the celebrity matchmaker added. \u00a0\"Ana clearly is mature, and at 36 years old, her frontal lobe has been developed, so I am in support.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"Out of all of the men who she has been linked to in the past, I believe that Tom could be \u2018the one,'\" Conti said. \"As a matchmaker, I truly am rooting for Tom to find love and finally have his happily ever after.",
      "\"It is clear that he is a man who puts his whole heart into each relationship that he enters, and it can seem like an impossible mission to risk the potential of failure again. ... But if anyone can do it, it's Tom Cruise.\"",

      "In an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital, Todd Anderson, co-founder of Dream Performance & Recovery and host of the \"Beat the Heat\" podcast, shared some lesser-known effects of spending time in a sauna.",
      "SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE CAN BRING LIFE-CHANGING HEALTH BENEFITS, EXPERT SAYS",
      "\"Sauna went from this thing that felt good, to something that could actually be a longevity tool,\" said the Nashville-based health and wellness expert. \"The combination of this hard science and the explosion in longevity and popularity has created something.\"",
      "Spending time in a sauna can have multiple health benefits, studies have shown. (iStock)",
      "Increased \"sauna bathing\" has been associated with a reduced risk of sudden cardiac death, fatal coronary heart disease, fatal cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, according to research from Finland.",
      "Participants in a global sauna survey in 2019 also reported health benefits regarding mental well-being and sleep, with few adverse effects.",
      "The survey found that participants \u2014 particularly from Finland, Australia and the U.S. \u2014 were most motivated to use saunas for relaxation.",
      "How heat improves sleep",
      "While saunas can improve longevity and mood, Anderson, whose podcast is hosted inside a sauna, added that heat exposure can also improve sleep.",
      "JUST ONE NIGHT OF POOR SLEEP COULD HAVE THESE SURPRISING HEALTH EFFECTS",
      "When the body heats up before sleep, the blood vessels open, allowing the body to get more circulation to the extremities, he said.",
      "Although the body\u2019s core temperature needs to cool down by about a degree to fall into quality sleep, raising the body temperature might seem \"counterintuitive,\" the expert added.",
      "When the body heats up before sleep, the blood vessels open, allowing the body to get more circulation to the extremities, an expert said. (iStock)",
      "But since the blood vessels are open and pumping more blood, this allows the core temperature to lower faster, and the body\u2019s instinct is to cool itself off after being exposed to heat.",
      "\"You go into a cold, dark room \u2026 and all of a sudden you're able to lower your core temperature much more quickly than you normally would, resulting in falling asleep faster and getting higher quality sleep throughout that first part of the night,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"Plenty of evidence shows that viruses do not do well in environments with high temperatures.\"",
      "The expert added that the same sleep benefits can be captured with a hot bath, shower or hot tub.",
      "\"The longevity and all-cause mortality benefits are going to be connected particularly to the sauna,\" he said. \"But there are some great sleep studies [showing the benefits] of applying any type of heat before bed.\"",
      "Viruses don\u2019t like it hot",
      "Exposure to heat can also help boost the immune system, as the body\u2019s natural response to fighting a bug is to spike a fever, according to critical care physician Dr. Roger Seheult.",
      "BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WITH THESE 8 SIMPLE STEPS",
      "Methods like steam saunas raise the body\u2019s natural temperature and can help kill off viruses that don\u2019t fare well in the heat, he said.",

      "Methods like steam saunas raise the body\u2019s natural temperature and can help kill off viruses that don\u2019t fare well in the heat. (iStock)",
      "In addition to the health benefits, Anderson noted that he\u2019s made lasting friendships during sauna sessions.",
      "\"It's a rare bubble in our society right now where phones don't work. You're face-to-face. You're going through some controlled adversity,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"There [are] just so many things that I think have dissipated from our society that are brought back to life in a sauna.\"",

      "Accessibility for all",
      "Enjoying a sauna doesn\u2019t have to require a luxury health club membership, according to Anderson, as saunas have been popularized in many cultures for generations.",
      "\"There are ways to make them with scrap wood and there are some different, cheap heating options,\" he said.",
      "Todd Anderson (right) sits outside his sauna after a session with \"Beat the Heat\" guest Ken Rideout. (Todd Anderson)",
      "In Finland, a country where saunas are a part of the everyday routine, there are more than five million people and three million saunas, noted Anderson, who recently visited there.",
      "\"Almost everybody has a sauna at their house,\" he shared.",

      "In many countries, saunas are part of the overall culture and can have healing properties, Anderson went on.",

      "In many countries, saunas are part of the overall culture and can have healing properties, Anderson said. (iStock)",
      "Proper practice and potential risk",
      "The average person will lose a pint of sweat during a short session in a sauna's dry heat, according to Harvard Health.",

      "\"Most of the extra blood flow is directed to the skin; in fact, the circulation actually shunts blood away from the internal organs. Blood pressure is unpredictable, rising in some people but falling in others.\"",
      "While saunas are generally safe for most people, Harvard Health cautioned that people with uncontrolled high blood pressure or heart disease should check with their doctors before participating.",

If someone opened the Passwords app and tapped a link, like \"Change Password,\" while connected to an insecure network, an attacker could intercept the request and redirect them to a fraudulent site mimicking a legitimate one, such as a fake Yelp login page.

      "1) Use a reliable password manager:\u00a0Apple apps are generally more secure than third-party options, but the Passwords app clearly wasn\u2019t. The fact that the security vulnerability existed for three months before Apple fixed it proves that Apple needs to put more emphasis on keeping customer data secure. I\u2019d suggest opting for a reliable password manager instead of relying on Apple\u2019s offering. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): It\u2019s good to have a password manager, but you know what\u2019s even better? 2FA.\u00a0Adding an extra layer of security with 2FA can prevent hackers from accessing your accounts, even if they steal your password. Use authentication apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or hardware security keys instead of SMS-based codes, which are vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "3) Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities and use a VPN:\u00a0Hackers can exploit unsecured public networks to intercept your login credentials. If you must access sensitive accounts on\u00a0public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and prevent attackers from snooping on your data. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.

      "4) Beware of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0You can have all the protection in the world but a phishing email or SMS can still cause havoc. Hackers often use fake login pages to trick you into entering your credentials. Always verify URLs before entering login details, avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Three months is a long time for a security flaw in a password manager to go unpatched, especially from a company that presents itself as a leader in privacy and security. This incident highlights a troubling reality. Apple\u2019s security measures are not infallible, and even built-in system apps can expose users to serious risks. While the fix eventually arrived, it should not have taken this long for such a fundamental issue to be addressed. If Apple wants to maintain its privacy-first image, it needs to do better by ensuring more rigorous security testing before launch.",

      "Most of us have at least one young woman in our lives that we cherish \u2014 a daughter, niece or goddaughter, for example. Well, this International Women\u2019s Day, I learned something that should be concerning to us all. Fully\u00a096% of all deepfakes \u2014 artificial intelligence-generated images and videos that use someone\u2019s likeness \u2014 are pornographic and target women without their consent.",
      "One well-known case involved an Australian law student who discovered that manipulated pornographic images of her were being shared online when she was just 18. But this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. According to a\u00a0recent survey of women in the U.S., AI deepfakes are among the types of online abuse that a significant number of women face despite being a relatively new technology.",
      "But this isn\u2019t the only type of online abuse women face.",
      "According to the same survey, one in four women in the U.S. say they\u2019ve experienced online abuse, including cyberbullying, doxxing, sexual harassment, trolling and AI deepfakes. And young women between the ages of 18 and 34 appear to experience much higher rates of online abuse than older generations.",

However, it also indicates that women use it more than men.",
      "Data privacy also plays a role. A recent study showed younger generations are generally less concerned about keeping their personal information private compared to older generations. Growing up in a digital-first world, many younger people appear to be desensitized to data collection and are more willing to share personal information online.

      "The new IRS scam alert",
      "To understand the new IRS scam, let\u2019s first examine what it\u2019s based on. The IRS has been sending out COVID-19 stimulus payments worth up to $1,400 to around 1 million tax filers who missed them. Initially, these payments were self-claimed, but now the IRS is automatically issuing them to ensure eligible taxpayers get what they\u2019re owed.",
      "This provision, known as the\u00a0Recovery Rebate Credit, allows people to claim missed stimulus payments from 2021. If you were eligible but didn\u2019t receive the funds, you can still claim them by filing a tax return by April 15, 2025. Payments will be deposited directly using the banking information listed on the taxpayer's 2023 return or sent as a paper check.",
      "However, TIGTA is warning that scammers are targeting taxpayers with fraudulent text messages, as reported by\u00a0TaxAct. These fake texts claim that recipients will receive an Economic Impact Payment from the IRS and often ask for sensitive personal information, like bank account details or your Social Security number. Scammers use this information to steal your identity or financial data.",
      "The IRS has made it clear that eligible taxpayers who didn\u2019t claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax return will receive their payments automatically; no action is required.",

      "Most phones and PCs today have enough protections to keep bad actors at bay, so in almost every case, the only way anyone can access your device and data is if you give it to them. Hackers often send\u00a0phishing links that\u00a0impersonate a government agency, someone you know or a trusted brand, tricking you into clicking. Once you do, malware is installed on your device to quietly collect useful data and send it to the hackers. That\u2019s why the most important part of staying safe online is knowing how to distinguish between legitimate and scam messages emails or calls. For example, you can easily tell if a communication is from the IRS or a scam by focusing on the following key factors.",

Install strong antivirus software: As scammers increasingly impersonate government agencies like the IRS through phishing links and fake messages, installing strong antivirus software is crucial to protect yourself from these threats. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Antivirus software can detect and block suspicious links, warn you about potentially harmful websites and prevent malware from being installed on your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Always verify the authenticity of unsolicited communications:\u00a0If you receive an unexpected email, text or phone call claiming to be from a government agency, it's essential to confirm its authenticity. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to trick you into taking immediate action. To verify, always use official contact details from government websites. Avoid clicking any links in the message and reach out to the agency directly to confirm whether the communication is legitimate.",
      "3. Reach out directly if you're unsure:\u00a0When you\u2019re unsure about the legitimacy of a message or request, contact the government agency directly using verified contact details. Never respond to the message or click on any links within it. By calling or visiting the agency\u2019s official website, you can ensure you\u2019re communicating with authorized representatives and avoid scammers impersonating government officials.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords to protect your accounts:\u00a0One of the best ways to protect your sensitive information from scammers is by using strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like \"password123\" or \"qwerty.\" Instead, create complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.",
      "Also, consider using a password manager to keep track of your credentials and ensure you\u2019re using different passwords for each account. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "5. Monitor your tax account: Regularly check your IRS account at\u00a0www.irs.gov to confirm the status of your tax return, verify that no unauthorized tax filings have occurred and update personal and contact information as needed.",
      "6. Report suspicious tax-related activities immediately: If you suspect a scam or fraudulent activity, it\u2019s crucial to report it to the relevant authorities right away. Whether you\u2019ve received a suspicious message or believe your information has been compromised, reporting it helps prevent further harm. The IRS and other agencies have dedicated channels for reporting fraud, so take action as soon as you can to protect yourself and others from these schemes.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: Use a personal data removal service to remove your personal information from data broker and people-finder sites, which scammers often use to find phone numbers and email addresses. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "8. Use direct deposit for refunds: This is the safest way to receive your tax refund, reducing the risk of mail theft, forgery or fraudulent check cashing.",
      "9. Be wary of spoofed websites: Type the address of your actual tax prep site rather than clicking on a link from an email or advertisement. Investigate the domain before entering any confidential information.",
      "10. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0An identity theft protection service provides personal and financial monitoring and will try to help you if your identity is ever compromised. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Tax season is here, and with it comes an increase in scams impersonating the IRS and targeting taxpayers. The good news is these scams are often easy to spot. If you receive a text message from the IRS asking you to provide personal information, it\u2019s a red flag; it\u2019s not from them. Be especially cautious of any links included in the message. A legitimate URL will always end in \".gov.\" However, scammers may try to trick you by altering the link slightly, so look closely for any misspellings or strange characters.

      "Key features and improvements",
      "Aria Gen 2 features an impressive array of upgrades from its predecessor. The glasses feature an advanced sensor suite that includes an RGB camera, 6DOF SLAM cameras, eye-tracking cameras and spatial microphones. One of the most innovative additions is a set of sensors embedded in the nosepad: a PPG sensor for heart rate monitoring and a contact microphone to distinguish the wearer's voice from others. This level of sophistication in sensor technology opens up new possibilities for research and development in AR applications.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Meta has also made significant strides in on-device processing capabilities. The company's custom silicon enables local processing of SLAM, eye tracking, hand tracking and speech recognition, reducing latency and enhancing the overall user experience.

      "While Aria Gen 2 is\u00a0currently a research tool, it offers amazing insights into the future capabilities of consumer AR glasses. The inclusion of a heart rate sensor suggests potential health-focused features in future eyewear, allowing for seamless health monitoring throughout the day. The spatial audio capabilities could be used to guide users to specific locations or help find lost items, enhancing everyday navigation and task completion.",
      "The hand and eye tracking technologies incorporated into Aria Gen 2 point towards more intuitive interfaces for future AR devices. These features could enable users to interact with digital content in their field of view naturally, without the need for additional controllers or input devices.",
      "These glasses, while not intended for consumer use, offer a glimpse into the future of AR and AI integration in everyday eyewear.

These glasses are packed with all sorts of high-tech goodies: advanced sensors, on-device processing, AI integration, the works.",
      "While we probably won't see all these fancy features in the AR glasses we can buy anytime soon, it's still great to imagine what's coming down the pipeline. Just think about it: One day, we might be wearing glasses that can monitor our health, help us navigate unfamiliar places or even assist those with visual impairments.

      "Many observers said the 7-1 ruling in Han's case did not signal much about the upcoming verdict on Yoon, as Han wasn\u2019t a key figure in imposing martial law. But the ruling could still embolden Yoon\u2019s staunch supporters and ramp up their political offensive on the opposition.",
      "Speaking with reporters following his reinstatement, Han thanked the court for what he called \"a wise decision\" and promised to focus on tackling \"urgent matters,\" including a fast-changing global trade environment, in an apparent reference to the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive tariffs policy.

Yoon's decree lasted only six hours as enough lawmakers managed to enter an assembly hall where they quickly voted down the decree.",
      "The impeachment arguments",
      "The assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, alleging he violated the Constitution and other laws by suppressing assembly activities and trying to detain politicians. Yoon's impeachment made Han acting president until he was impeached in late December.",

      "A major trigger for the opposition\u2019s push to impeach Han was his refusal to fill three vacant seats at the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench. That was a highly explosive issue because the court needed support from at least six justices to approve Yoon's impeachment and filling its empty posts could make such a decision more likely.",
      "After Han was suspended, his successor as acting president, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant.",
      "Han was also accused in the impeachment motion of abetting Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration and obstructing efforts to open independent investigations into Yoon\u2019s alleged rebellion in connection with his martial law decree.",
      "On Monday, seven of the Constitutional Court's eight justices ruled to overturn or dismiss Han's impeachment. They ruled that his alleged actions weren\u2019t against the law or weren\u2019t serious enough to remove him from office or his impeachment motion didn't even meet a required quorum when it passed through the assembly. One justice upheld Han\u2019s impeachment.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party expressed regret over the court\u2019s decision to reinstate Han and urged it to dismiss Yoon quickly. Yoon\u2019s office welcomed Monday\u2019s ruling, saying it shows again the opposition\u2019s repeated uses of impeachment motions were \"reckless, malicious political offensive.\"",
      "What's next?",
      "Observers earlier had predicted the Constitutional Court would rule on Yoon\u2019s case in mid-March, but it hasn\u2019t done so, sparking varied speculation on possible reasons.",
      "\"Today\u2019s verdict will give hope to Yoon\u2019s supporters for a similar fate and hope for Yoon\u2019s opponents for his ouster,\" said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \"But it\u2019s too soon to predict the court\u2019s verdict on Yoon because the specific details of both cases and allegations are different.\"",
      "Kim said the reinstatement of Han, a career bureaucrat, will bring more stability to South Korea compared to when his powers as acting president were suspended.",
      "Massive rival rallies backing or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea. Earlier surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans were critical of Yoon\u2019s martial law enactment, but those supporting or sympathizing with Yoon have later gained strength.",
      "Yoon argues that his martial law introduction was a desperate attempt to bring attention to the \"wickedness\" of the Democratic Party which obstructed his agenda and filed many impeachment motions against senior officials.

      "The \"Eagles of Antioch,\" is a volunteer organization made up of around 500 volunteers, operating within three primarily Christian neighborhoods in Damascus. They watch over Christian areas from dusk to dawn, patrolling the streets and protecting Christian shrines from attack.",
      "Danial Georgios, a construction engineer living in Damascus, spoke exclusively to Fox News Digital about the group's work in Damascus neighborhoods. Georgios, 30, and his Eagles of Antioch want to fill in the security gap until tensions ease.",

      "The group derives its name from the ancient city of Antioch, reflecting their deep-rooted connection to the Antiochian Patriarchate. Members hail from three main Christian denominations: Antiochian Greek Orthodox, Antiochian Melkite Catholics and Antiochian Syriac Orthodox.",
      "Members of the group patrol their communities, protecting Christian holy sites, including shrines, symbols and churches. If a site is damaged or vandalized, the group will repair it themselves, hoping to avoid an escalation into sectarian conflict between the Christian community and their Sunni neighbors.",
      "They advocate for a system based on strong municipalities, or extreme local governance, enabling Christians across Syria to manage their own affairs and celebrate their religious festivals without fear of persecution. Since emerging, the group has successfully protected liquor stores, churches, shrines and residences from theft and vandalism, according to the Eagles of Antioch.",
      "Georgios and his peers were spurred to action in December after a Christmas tree was lit on fire in Al-Sqailbiyyah, just outside Hama. Radical jihadists, according to Georgios, were responsible for the vandalism. Following the incident, He and his fellow Christians organized a mass peaceful protest inside Damascus, chanting for equal rights for all Syrians.",

      "Yet, King's organization isn't as hopeful. \"Since HTS toppled the Assad regime in December 2024, the environment has been precarious at best. But the bloodshed that unfolded March 6-10 in Latakia and Tartous represents a frightening escalation. According to the Syrian Observatory, the violence claimed over 1,540 lives\u2014predominantly civilians, with reports indicating between four and a dozen Christians among the casualties.\"",

      "King's organization noted that the new interim Syrian constitution states, \"The religion of the President of the Republic is Islam,\" Article III declares, and \"Islamic jurisprudence is the principal source of legislation.\" The group says that \"this language is slightly starker than Syria\u2019s previous constitution, which cited Islamic law as simply one source among others.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal appeals court judge pressed lawyers for the Trump administration Monday about its use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport people alleged to be Venezuelan gang members, saying the \"Nazis got better treatment\" during World War II.",
      "U.S. Circuit Judge Patricia Millett of the District of Columbia Circuit made the remark as she questioned Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign about the alleged Tren de Aragua gang members who were flown to a prison in El Salvador on March 15, after President Donald Trump invoked the wartime authority against the gang.",
      "Millett, whom President Barack Obama appointed to the bench, said deportees weren't given any due process before they were removed from the United States and weren't told where they were being sent. They also weren't given the opportunity to dispute whether they were involved with the gang, she said.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The last time the United States used the 1798 law was during World War II, Millett said, adding that Nazis were able to make their case against removal from the United States to a hearing board.",
      "In this case, \"people weren't given notice\" or provided a chance to contest their removal, a situation that was stopped only by a federal judge's emergency order on March 15, Millett said.",
      "\"There were planeloads of people. There were no procedures in place to notify people,\" Millett said. \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemy Act.\"",
      "Millett agreed with Ensign that the wartime law is constitutional but questioned how it was implemented \u2014 asking whether, in the absence of due process, she could be labeled a gang member and deported without a hearing.",
      "Ensign said that \"nothing of the sort is in the record here.\" Pressed later by Millett about whether people alleged to be gang members would continue to be deported without hearings if the appeals court lifted a lower court's temporary halt on the deportations, Ensign acknowledged they would.",
      "Another of the judges on the panel, Justin Walker, appeared more skeptical of the plaintiffs' claims.",
      "Walker, who was appointed to the bench during the first Trump administration, asked American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt multiple questions about why the case was brought in Washington, D.C., instead of Texas, where the deportees were being held. Gelernt said the plaintiffs are seeking to stop people from being deported, not to release them from U.S. custody.",
      "The third judge on panel, George H.W. Bush appointee Karen Henderson, didn't ask any substantive questions.",
      "The appeals court didn't immediately rule on the administration's request to lift U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's order that halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg denied the administration's bid to lift his hold earlier in the day and found that the Venezuelan nationals the administration wants to deport should most likely be given the opportunity to challenge allegations that they're members of the Tren de Aragua gang first.",
      "Trump has repeatedly attacked Boasberg over his emergency order temporarily halting deportations stemming from Trump's invocation of the law, which had been used before only during declared wars. Trump has said in posts on his social media platform that Boasberg \"is doing everything in his power to usurp the Power of the Presidency\" and \u201cdoesn\u2019t mind if criminals come into our Country.\"",
      "Boasberg didn't mention the Trump posts in his ruling Monday but did note that his ruling blocked deportations only under the AEA and doesn't bar people from being detained under the act or deported under other authorities.",
      "\"It is important to stress once again that the Order was narrow: it prevented Defendants only from removing the Plaintiff class on the sole basis of the Proclamation. In other words, the Order did not prevent Defendants from removing anyone \u2014 to include members of the class \u2014 through other immigration authorities,\" he wrote, adding that member of Tren de Aragua are deportable under other statutes since Trump designated the gang a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "\"The Order also did not require Defendants to release a single person held in their custody, even individuals held only on the basis of the Proclamation,\" Boasberg added. \"And it did not even prevent Defendants from apprehending noncitizens under the authority of the Proclamation (or any other law, for that matter).\"",
      "What his order did limit was deporting people alleged to be gang members to a notoriously dangerous El Salvador prison without allowing them to contest that they're involved with the gang, as the five plaintiffs in the case have done.",
      "Boasberg suggested the government had acted in bad faith to avoid such hearings. He noted two planes carrying deportees took off on March 15, even though the administration knew about the emergency hearing on the issue before him and called it \"a move that implied a desire to circumvent judicial review.\"",
      "The administration \"knew as of 10:00 a.m. on March 15 that the Court would hold a hearing later that day, and the most reasonable inference is that it hustled people onto those planes in the hopes of evading an injunction or perhaps preventing them from requesting the habeas hearing to which the Government now acknowledges they are entitled,\" he wrote.",
      "Boasberg said he'd asked the Justice Department at during the 5 p.m. hearing whether any such flights were underway and was told by a Justice Department attorney that he didn't know. Boasberg then took a recess to allow the lawyer to check.",
      "\u201cWhen the hearing resumed shortly after 6:00 p.m., the Government surprisingly represented that it still had no flight details to share,\u201d he said.",
      "He has since repeatedly demanded that the government give him information about on the timing of the flights \u2014 which it has yet to do, arguing he's not entitled to the information.",
      "In his ruling Monday, Boasberg denied the government's motion to vacate his order, citing the \"irreparable harm\" that could be caused by sending non-gang members to El Salvador.",
      "\"In Salvadoran prisons, deportees are reportedly 'highly likely to face immediate and intentional life-threatening harm at the hands of state actors,'\" he wrote, and the deportees face horrific living conditions and the \"likelihood of potential torture.\"",
      "The plaintiffs claim that \"many\" of the deportees on the two flights weren't affiliated with the gang, which the administration denies.",
      "\"As the Government itself concedes, the awesome power granted by the Act may be brought to bear only on those who are, in fact, 'alien enemies,'\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "\"Because the named Plaintiffs dispute that they are members of Tren de Aragua, they may not be deported until a court has been able to decide the merits of their challenge,\" he added. \"Nor may any members of the provisionally certified class be removed until they have been given the opportunity to challenge their designations as well.\"",
      "They \"are entitled to individualized hearings to determine whether the Act applies to them at all,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Stocks surged to their highest levels in more than a week Monday, following weekend reports from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal that the president was no longer going to impose blanket duties on industrial sectors like automobiles, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.",
      "Shares of Tesla, which have been battered by both sluggish sales and a backlash against CEO Elon Musk, soared 9.5% Monday; previously, the company submitted a letter to Trump\u2019s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, stating it was vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries in response to Trump\u2019s measures.",
      "A source familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking told NBC News early Monday that the president has yet to make a final decision about the ultimate scale of his promised blanket-tariffs, expected to be announced on April 2. Trump delivered further volatility on Monday when he announced on his Truth Social platform that, starting that date, any country that purchases oil or gas from Venezuela would be forced to pay a 25% tariff on any trade they do with the U.S.",
      "Later Monday, Trump hinted at even more leeway in the April 2 duties, while stating other levies on industrial items could still be forthcoming.",
      "\u201cI may give a lot of countries breaks, but it\u2019s reciprocal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we might be even nicer than that. You know, we\u2019ve been very nice to a lot of countries for a long time.\"",

      "The president has demonstrated a willingness to relent somewhat on his tariff threats, even as he publicly maintains pressure. Last week, he signaled that when it came to tariffs on China, there was room for \u201ctalk,\u201d and that while he was intent on imposing new tit-for-tat duties on longstanding U.S. partners, daylight remained.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t change. But the word flexibility is an important word,\u201d Trump said in remarks in the Oval Office. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s flexibility. So there\u2019ll be flexibility, but basically it\u2019s reciprocal.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also suggested last week that the range of countries targeted by the April 2 duties would likely be more limited than what has previously been reported, telling Fox News Host Maria Bartiromo that a \u201cDirty 15,\u201d referring to the approximately 15% of nations with persistent trade imbalances with the U.S., would be affected.",
      "In descending order, the nations and entities with the largest trade deficits with the U.S. are\u00a0 China, the E.U., Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada and India.",
      "Trump\u2019s ongoing openness to negotiate is why the threatened 25% duties on Mexico and Canada were ultimately suspended, then scaled back to only include goods not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.",
      "Trump also proved receptive to entreaties from major auto firms about how dramatic the impact of the tariffs with America\u2019s northern and southern neighbors would be to their businesses.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s trade minister was set to meet with White House officials to discuss the prospect of a bilateral trade deal focused on technology, Reuters reported last week. Bloomberg said Monday that the E.U.\u2019s trade chief was also expected to meet with White House officials Tuesday.",
      "U.S. officials are also in India this week as part of ongoing trade talks.",

      "Heading into Monday, only steel and aluminum tariffs and higher duties against Chinese goods have gone into effect, despite a host of threats to impose more tariffs.",
      "Whatever its final form, the president\u2019s tariffs strategy continues to cast a pall over economic growth outlooks. S&P Global financial group said Monday that business expectations for the year ahead had fallen to their second lowest since October 2022 in March, \u201cas companies grew increasingly cautious about the economic outlook, often citing worries over customer demand and the impact of aspects of the new administration\u2019s policies.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe near universal intent to pass through higher tariffs via prices means either inflation will result or, if the pricing environment is more resistant, corporate profit margins will begin to feel pressured,\u201d S&P analysts wrote.",
      "And last week, the Federal Reserve suggested tariff threats were putting upward pressure on price growth, though by what extent was not yet clear.

But it does mean he\u2019s speaking to their reality in a way most Democrats aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Kamala Harris often spoke about issues of importance to women, emphasizing reproductive rights, for instance, and paid family leave policies. But soul-searching over her loss has prompted Democrats to reach out more aggressively to men, by engaging more with sports, for instance, and looking for ways to make the party seem less \u201cuncool\u201d to young voters.",
      "Shauna Daly, a Democratic strategist and co-founder of the Young Men Research Project, said candidates need to do more than show young men that they can hang. \u201cWhere the Democratic Party has really fallen short with this cohort is that they don\u2019t feel like Democrats are fighting for them,\u201d she said.",
      "They need policies like those the governors have proposed, Daly said, that address men's tangible problems.",
      "In every state, women earn more college degrees than men. Boys are more likely to be disciplined in class, and less likely to graduate high school on time than girls. Men die by suicide at higher rates than women and are more likely to rely on illicit drugs and alcohol. And while women increasingly participate in the workforce at higher rates, men have steadily dropped out of the labor market.",
      "The governors\u2019 speeches touched on many of these issues, and\u00a0earned cautious applause from masculinity researchers, who said they reflected a promising shift.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s part of a growing recognition among Democrats that neglecting the problems of boys and men is neither good policy nor good politics,\u201d said Richard Reeves, founder of the American Institute for Boys and Men, who has informally advised Moore\u2019s staff.\u00a0\u201cIf Democrats weren\u2019t thinking about male voters, and especially young male voters, then it would be a pretty serious dereliction of duty, looking at the polls.\u201d",
      "In the past, Democrats might have been wary of targeting programs toward boys and men for fear of excluding girls. Whitmer seemed aware of this dynamic in her speech,\u00a0when she followed her announcement about young men with a shoutout to women and a vow not to abandon her \u201ccommitment to equal opportunity and dignity for everyone.\u201d",
      "A handful of other states, including some run by Republican governors, have already launched initiatives targeting men in recent years. Utah established a task force that aims to help \u201cmen and boys lead flourishing lives,\u201d and North Dakota created the position of a men\u2019s health coordinator to study and raise awareness of disparities affecting men.",
      "Moore said he was partly inspired by his own experience growing up in the Bronx after his father passed. He has described how troubles in his youth \u2014 including a brush with the police for vandalism, skipping school and getting poor grades \u2014 led his mother to send him away to military school, which he credits with helping him straighten up.",
      "\u201cIt is very personal for me, because I was one of those young men and boys that we\u2019re trying to reach,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I felt like so many of the conversations that were being had about me were not being had with me.\u201d",
      "Moore will hold a cabinet meeting in April to discuss plans for the state agencies, but he has some initial goals: to encourage more men in his state to pursue jobs in education and health care, help boys within the juvenile justice system, and make sure he solicits input from boys and men on how the initiatives are designed.",
      "For Della Volpe, from the Harvard Kennedy School, the governors\u2019 announcements are encouraging. \u201cThe truth is, young men are speaking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been telling us they want respect, opportunity, and strength. If Democrats don\u2019t listen \u2014 and act \u2014 they\u2019ll keep losing ground. But this moment offers hope.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration filed new allegations against Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student detained due to his pro-Palestinian activism on campus, while trying to dismiss his First Amendment violation claims as a \"red herring.\"",
      "In a filing Sunday, the Justice Department said Khalil, who is a green-card holder, withheld information about his membership in certain organizations and failed to disclose his employment at the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, in his permanent residency application.",
      "Khalil, a native of Syria and citizen of Algeria, entered the U.S. on a student visa in December 2022 and was adjusted to lawful permanent resident status in November 2024.",
      "He allegedly did not disclose that he was a member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) as a political officer or that he was part of Columbia University Apartheid Divest when he applied to become a permanent resident in 2024, according to a Department of Homeland Security March 17 document, which the government referenced in its filing.",
      "The administration claimed that Khalil also failed to disclose his employment as a program manager by the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut after 2022, according to the document, which detailed additional grounds for Khalil's deportation. It is not immediately clear when or if Khalil stopped working at the embassy.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, it is considered fraud and willful misrepresentation if a permanent residency applicant \"misrepresents material facts\" to \"conceal group memberships\" that would make them ineligible for permanent residency status.",
      "\"It is black-letter law that misrepresentations in this context are not protected speech,\" the government filing states. \"Thus, Khalil\u2019s First Amendment allegations are a red herring, and there is an independent basis to justify removal sufficient to foreclose Khalil\u2019s constitutional claim here.\"",
      "However, the government will have to prove to the immigration judge that Khalil willfully failed to disclose that information, and whether that disclosure would have impacted his eligibility for permanent residency.",
      "Baher Azmy, an attorney for Khalil, told NBC News: \"These late-breaking, after-the-fact allegations, silly as they are, primarily show that the government must know the supposed 'foreign policy' grounds for Mahmoud\u2019s removal are absurd and unconstitutional.\"",
      "Azmy said the government's new claims \"cannot change the obvious fact the government has admitted \u2014 he is being punished in the most autocratic way for his constitutionally protected speech.\"",
      "Khalil was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Investigations at his Columbia University apartment on March 8. He was arrested in New York, transported briefly to a facility in New Jersey, and transported to an ICE facility in Jena, Louisiana on March 10.",
      "Khalil had been initially arrested under a rarely used provision in immigration law, where the Secretary of State has the authority to deport someone if it\u2019s determined the person \"would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\" in his activism at Columbia University. However, his attorneys deny the allegations, saying Khalil was targeted for free speech supporting the Palestinian cause.",
      "Khalil filed a lawsuit, also known as a habeas petition, protesting his detention in New York. The lawsuit cited a violation of his right to due process and the First Amendment right to free speech. Last week, a New York judge ordered the habeas petition to continue in New Jersey because Khalil\u2019s attorneys filed the case while he was detained there.",
      "New York Federal Judge Jesse Furman also barred his deportation amid the lawsuit, saying Khalil\u2019s claims of First and Fifth Amendment violations warrant \"careful judicial review.\"",
      "The Trump administration's Sunday filing in the district of New Jersey argued that the state lacked jurisdiction to hear the habeas case.",
      "It further emphasized the administration's original argument for Khalil's arrest and sought to bypass his argument that he was targeted for free speech by pointing to his alleged lack of disclosures in his permanent residency application.",
      "Khalil, who is not facing any publicly known criminal charges, also has a separate deportation case in Louisiana, where he's being detained.",
      "Marc Van\u00a0Der\u00a0Hout, Khalil\u2019s attorney in his deportation proceedings, told NBC News on Friday that \"this is not a typical case and it's outrageous.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s almost unprecedented to invoke a provision like this,\" Van\u00a0Der\u00a0Hout said on the immigration law provision initially cited by the administration. \"The government is clearly going after him because they don\u2019t like what he says about what\u2019s going on in the Middle East and that\u2019s the bottom line. We\u2019re going to fight this strongly.\"",
      "Following the Israel-Hamas war, Columbia University became the forefront of student protests in support of the Palestinian people.",
      "The Student Workers of Columbia labor union plans to hold an informational picket at 1 p.m. on Monday to demand protection for international student workers, the restoration of slashed funding, and \"reinstatement of all students disciplined for pro-Palestine activism and speech.\" Columbia faculty will also hold a \"Vigil to Defend Democracy\" at noon on Monday."

      "When the brackets settled Friday night after the round of 64, half of the remaining 32 men\u2019s teams came from college sports\u2019 two most-powerful conferences, the SEC and Big Ten. And by Sunday night, when just 16 teams remained, that major-conference dominance extended even further, with all 16 spots occupied by either the SEC (seven), Big Ten (four), Big 12 (four) and ACC (one).",
      "It\u2019s the fewest number of conferences ever represented in the Sweet 16. Since tournament expansion created the Round of 16 in 1975, every Sweet 16 has featured at least seven conferences, with a record of 11.",
      "Yet midnight arrived early for Cinderella in 2025.",
      "The last, best hope for a \u201cmid-major\u201d conference to advance to the tournament\u2019s second weekend was 12th-seeded Colorado State of the Mountain West, which lost to Maryland of the Big Ten on Sunday night on a buzzer-beater.",
      "As with most college sports developments in recent years, conference realignment has played a role.",
      "As conferences have grown, the odds their schools will make up a larger share of the tournament\u2019s bracket has increased.",
      "Sixth-seeded BYU, which beat Virginia Commonwealth and Wisconsin to advance to the second weekend, had represented mid-major conferences until 2023 when it joined the Big 12 \u2014 one of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cPower Five\u201d conferences, a number that dropped to four last year upon the collapse of the Pac-12 \u2014 after the conference went looking to add new members following Texas and Oklahoma\u2019s departure for the SEC.",
      "The tournament\u2019s opening weekend still featured a handful of surprises. Twelfth-seeded McNeese State, the champion of the one-bid Southland Conference, beat fifth-seeded Clemson of the ACC, and 11th-seeded Drake of the Missouri Valley Conference beat Missouri of the SEC in the opening round.",
      "Yet the tournament that derives much of its lore \u2014 and value from its $8 billion media-rights deal with CBS and Turner \u2014 from its unpredictability and parity has instead been mostly chalk. In the Midwest region, in particular, a lower seed won only one of 12 possible games through the first two rounds.",
      "The Big Ten won its first 10 games of the tournament. And the SEC, which last week was celebrating a single-conference record of placing 14 teams in the 68-team bracket, watched as a record seven advanced to the Sweet 16.",
      "Of the 16 teams that began the tournament seeded first through fourth, 12 remain alive. Following Sunday\u2019s loss by two-time defending champion Connecticut, this year\u2019s tournament will crown a new champion.",
      "It just won\u2019t come from out of nowhere."

      "The former child stars, who reunited for the first time in nearly 20 years for an episode of Peck\u2019s podcast, \u201cGood Guys,\u201d reflected on the revelations made in last year\u2019s docuseries \u201cQuiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV.\u201d",
      "The Investigative Discovery series, which aired in March 2024, featured interviews with several actors and former child stars who alleged abuse, inappropriate behavior and a toxic work environment while appearing on some Nickelodeon shows.",
      "It was the first time Bell publicly addressed his accusations of child sexual abuse against Nick dialogue coach Brian Peck (no relation to Josh Peck), who was arrested in 2003 and charged with \u201clewd acts with a child,\u201d according to a news release from the Los Angeles Police Department. The release said Brian Peck had molested an unidentified minor he had worked with over a period of six months.",
      "After he pleaded no contest, Brian Peck was convicted of lewd or lascivious acts with a 14- or 15-year-old child and oral copulation with a minor under 16, according to a case summary from Los Angeles County Superior Court. He was sentenced to 16 months in prison.",
      "Brian Peck was \u201cwalking around set\u201d during the filming of the show\u2019s pilot as the investigation was happening, Bell said in the podcast episode.",
      "\u201cWhere I felt most comfortable, where I was the happiest, was when I was on set with you guys,\u201d Bell told Josh Peck. \u201cAnd the worst part was, every day I got there, the monster was there.\u201d",
      "Attempts to reach Brian Peck for comment were unsuccessful on Monday.",
      "At the time the \u201cDrake & Josh\u201d pilot was being shot, Bell said he agonized about whether the situation would negatively impact the show's future. He was afraid the investigation would go public.",

      "\u201cDrake & Josh,\" in which the two played stepbrothers and polar opposites, ended in 2007. But Bell\u2019s identity in Brian Peck's case wasn\u2019t revealed until the the docuseries debuted in 2024.",
      "Josh Peck previously said that he had reached out to Bell privately in the days after \u201cQuiet on Set\u201d was released.",
      "When they caught up on the podcast episode, Josh Peck recounted the moment he noticed Brian Peck had suddenly disappeared from set.",

      "But it wasn\u2019t until the docuseries came out that Josh Peck said he learned the full extent of what his co-star went through.",
      "\u201cIn watching the documentary at 38, as a father, as a grown-up, so much was revealed to me of what you had to go through,\u201d Josh Peck said. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine that.\u201d",
      "He later said working as a child actor during that time, \u201cthere were so many things that you would see on set in a day and just go, \u2018I don\u2019t know if that\u2019d be cool anywhere else but here.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so when you had tyrannical bosses or just people acting inappropriately,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think the assumption was, in Hollywood, like this was just kind of part of it.\u2019\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Nickelodeon previously issued a statement on the docuseries.",
      "\u201cThough we cannot corroborate or negate allegations of behaviors from productions decades ago, Nickelodeon as a matter of policy investigates all formal complaints as part of our commitment to fostering a safe and professional workplace environment free of harassment or other kinds of inappropriate conduct,\" the spokesperson said in March 2024. \"Our highest priorities are the well-being and best interests not just of our employees, casts and crew, but of all children, and we have adopted numerous safeguards over the years to help ensure we are living up to our own high standards and the expectations of our audience.\u201d",

The actor was sentenced to two years of probation for child endangerment after he was accused of \u201cgrooming\u201d a female victim from when she was 12. He pleaded guilty to felony attempted child endangerment and a misdemeanor charge for disseminating matter harmful to juveniles.",

      "Even as some hard-line conservatives in the House introduce articles of impeachment against certain judges \u2014 most notably U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump\u2019s using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants \u2014 it's unlikely such resolutions could win enough Republican support to reach majorities in the House. In addition, 67 votes would be needed for convictions in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority.",
      "Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, said Monday on Fox News that his committee will hold a hearing next week focused on Boasberg and that Issa's bill is a \u201cgood piece of legislation.\u201d",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., who controls the floor schedule, said Monday that the chamber would vote on it next week.",
      "In an appearance Sunday on Fox News, Johnson appeared to throw cold water on the idea of impeaching judges, instead pointing to the appeals process as a way to fight back against rulings he disagreed with.",
      "\u201cI do think the line is being crossed right now,\u201d said Johnson, a former lawyer who litigated religious liberty cases. Recalling his experience, he said: \u201cI never walked out of those courtrooms thinking that I could impeach those judges. I just got as quickly as I could to the appellate court to get them overturned.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut something\u2019s happening right now,\u201d he continued, pointing to the number of Trump\u2019s policies that had been blocked by federal injunctions. \u201cSomething\u2019s amiss. I think we\u2019ve got to address it.\u201d",
      "Asked about the possibility of pursuing impeachment of judges Monday at the Capitol, Johnson told reporters that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d but added that \u201cimpeachment is an extraordinary measure\u201d and that Republicans are looking at \u201call the alternatives.\u201d",
      "Other senior House Republicans also aren\u2019t in a rush to impeach judges who\u2019ve ruled against Trump. Rep. Roger Williams, of Texas, the chair of the Small Business Committee, said Monday he has been entirely focused on Trump\u2019s decision to have the Small Business Administration take over the Education Department\u2019s student loan portfolio.",
      "\u201cI do think the judge is overstepping. So we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Williams said of Boasberg.",
      "Other Republicans, including moderate Rep. Don Bacon, of Nebraska, said they oppose impeaching judges because of their decisions.",
      "\"I don't like that,\" Bacon told NBC News. \"Unless you do something illegal, or we've impeached judges for bribes and doing things like that, but not because somebody's trying to follow their sense of the Constitution. If you don't like it, appeal it. That's been our tradition since 1789.\"",
      "And Rep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla., a former chair of two House committees, suggested that impeaching judges could come back to bite Republicans when Democrats are in control of the House in the future.",
      "\u201cThe thing I ask my colleagues in the House is, maybe we\u2019re not happy with how certain judges are ruling now, but you set a standard that will apply for years or decades to come. How do you make sure that you don\u2019t create retribution towards conservative judges in the future?\u201d Lucas asked in an interview.",
      "He said he is open to Issa's bill but not enthusiastic about it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not an attorney, but my understanding of the Constitution is that \u2014 after the Supreme Court \u2014 we create all the lower courts and we create the procedural stuff,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI think his bill is within its legal scope, but that\u2019s a big move, too.\u201d",
      "Republicans control 218 seats to Democrats\u2019 213 in the House, meaning Johnson can afford only two GOP defections on any vote. It explains why Republicans don\u2019t believe impeaching judges \u2014 which would require simple-majority votes \u2014 could pass the House.",
      "But if the House somehow did manage to impeach a judge, it would automatically trigger an impeachment trial in the Senate. That could eat up valuable floor time at a critical moment when Republicans in both chambers are trying to push forward on a package to advance Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.",
      "On Monday, Boasberg denied the government\u2019s request to lift his hold on deportations under the Enemy Aliens Act of 1798, arguing that the Venezuelan nationals should be given a chance to challenge allegations that they are members of a gang. Boasberg\u2019s decision has been appealed to a federal appeals court, which heard arguments Monday.",
      "Boasberg\u2019s initial ruling prompted freshman Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, last week to file articles of impeachment against Boasberg, the chief judge of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who in the past has been appointed by both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.",
      "\"Activist judges know that even if their rulings get overturned on appeal, the process could take months or years, burning away valuable time from Trump\u2019s Presidency, stopping him from executing on the mandate voters gave him,\" Gill said Friday on X. \"That\u2019s why the Supreme Court must step in and Congress must act NOW.\""

    "story": [
      "The family of a woman who died of strangulation during an overnight visit with her husband at a California prison is questioning why a man convicted of murdering four people was allowed to have family visits.",
      "Stephanie Diane Dowells, 62, who also went by the name Stephanie Brinson, was killed in November, making her the second person in a year to die at Mule Creek State Prison in Ione during a family visit, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "The other victim, Tania Thomas, 47, was also strangled during a family visit, Amador County District Attorney Todd Riebe said in an interview Monday. The man she was visiting has been charged with murder in connection with her killing, Riebe said.",
      "Dowells, a hairdresser, was killed while visiting her husband, David Brinson, 54, who was convicted in the 1990s of murdering four men during a robbery, and sentenced to four consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.",
      "After Brinson called prison officials at 2:04 a.m. on Nov. 13 to tell them his wife had passed out, officers immediately began life-saving measures and called 911, a spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. But Dowells was pronounced dead a short time later.",
      "Dowells\u2019 killing remains under investigation by prison officials and the district attorney\u2019s office, the spokesperson said. Riebe said charges are pending prison and autopsy reports.",
      "The Amador County Sheriff\u2019s Office confirmed she had been strangled and her death was a homicide.",
      "Dowells\u2019 son, Armand Torres, 28, and his wife, Nataly Jimenez, said that in the days after Dowells\u2019 death, Brinson\u2019s account of events kept changing, including the exact time and location where he found Dowells unconscious.",
      "\u201cHe would say, you know, she passed out on the floor, or she was passed out on the bed,\u201d Jimenez said in an interview.",
      "Dowells lived in Inglewood, California, with Torres, Jimenez and their 3-year-old son, who called Brinson \u201cGrandpa.\u201d",
      "Torres, Jimenez, their son and Dowells were all very close, and the couple allowed the boy to accompany Dowells on family visits to Mule Creek Prison twice in the last couple of years.",
      "\u201cIf I could trust him with my kid, I\u2019m thinking, it\u2019s a green light,\u201d Torres said of Brinson. \u201cYou know, like, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d",
      "He said his mother told him his son had enjoyed the visits, which was enough assurance for him to trust Brinson around his son.",
      "Torres said he sometimes worried about his mom being with someone who was incarcerated, but he tried to be supportive. He said he was unaware that Brinson had been convicted of murdering four people.",
      "\u201cWe really love our mom, and we just wanted her to be happy, you know, and she usually came back happy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey talked on the phone everyday, everything seemed good. I\u2019m all for second chances.",
      "\u201cIf she was happy, I was happy,\u201d he said.",
      "Torres would sometimes overhear his mother and Brinson arguing on the phone, he said, but he didn\u2019t think much of it because couples sometimes quarrel, especially when one partner is incarcerated.",
      "\u201cStephanie was always a forgiving person, and she always tried to see the better in people,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cDespite their background or anything, she would always try to see the good in them. That\u2019s what she did with her husband.\u201d",
      "Torres said his mother and Brinson met before he was born in 1996, and he didn\u2019t meet Brinson until about 2016.",
      "Thomas, the other victim, was found unconscious on July 1, 2024, in a family visiting unit, where she was spending time with her domestic partner, Anthony Curry, officials said.",
      "Curry, 48, is serving a life sentence for attempted second-degree murder with an enhancement of intentionally discharging a firearm causing great bodily injury.",
      "He was also sentenced to 13 years in prison for carjacking with an enhancement of using a firearm, a Department of Corrections spokesperson said.",
      "Curry has been charged with murder in connection with Thomas\u2019 death, but has not been arraigned, Riebe said.",
      "The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation website says some incarcerated people are eligible for family visits, which occur in private, apartment-like facilities on prison grounds and last from 30 to 40 hours.",
      "The visits are intended to support positive family connections and successful rehabilitation, the website says. Death row inmates and people convicted of sex offenses are excluded, as is anyone under disciplinary restrictions, the website says.",
      "\u201cThe family visits are a privilege, and incarcerated persons must apply and meet strict eligibility criteria to be approved,\u201d a department spokesperson said.\u00a0\u201cOnly those who demonstrate sustained good behavior and meet specific program requirements are considered.\u201d",
      "An online prison operations manual says inmates in family-visiting quarters have to present themselves for a count a minimum of four times in a 24-hour period.",
      "Torres said that no matter the level of supervision, he believes it should be higher, especially for prisoners with violent histories.",
      "\u201cI want them to take some accountability for this, the prison,\u201d Torres said. \u201cBecause what\u2019s stopping the next person from killing their wife or son or anybody?\u201d"

    "summary": "Republican are concerned about the lackluster fundraising from state Sen. Randy Fine, the party's candidate in next week's special election in Florida's 6th District.",
    "story": [
      "Republican leaders have grown privately alarmed about the massive fundraising disparity their candidate, Randy Fine, faces in a special House election in a deep-red Florida district and have swooped in to help resuscitate his campaign at the eleventh hour.",
      "House GOP leaders have in recent days been calling donors to plead for financial help in the race to fill the seat previously held by Mike Waltz, who is now President Donald Trump's national security adviser, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. In addition, Fine, a state senator, has made personal pleas to Florida-based lobbyists and donors for a quick infusion of cash before the April 1 election, according to two sources familiar with those conversations.",
      "While party leaders in Washington and Florida are ultimately confident that Fine will pull off a victory, Republicans say they\u2019re frustrated that they need to intervene in a district that Trump won by 30 points last year.",
      "Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., who leads the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm, said Fine \u201cneeds to do better\u201d on his fundraising. But Hudson was confident Republicans would hold on to the seat and said he didn\u2019t expect the National Republican Congressional Committee to spend in the race.",
      "\u201cI would have preferred if our candidate had raised money at a faster rate and gotten on TV quicker,\u201d Hudson told reporters Monday. \u201cBut he\u2019s doing what he needs to do. He\u2019s on TV now. We\u2019re going to win the seat. I\u2019m not concerned at all.\u201d",
      "Fine\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Fine has been significantly outraised by his Democratic opponent, teacher Josh Weil, who has raised a whopping $9.7 million to Fine\u2019s $561,000, according to fundraising reports filed last week with the Federal Election Commission. Fine also just started airing his first TV ad last week as part of a joint ad buy with the Florida Republican Party, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.",
      "In recent days, Fine has contributed $600,000 of his own money to his campaign, and FEC filings show that he has received contributions from PACs tied to Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and GOP Reps. Byron Donalds, of Florida; Greg Murphy, of North Carolina; Jeff Crank, of Colorado; and Ben Cline, of Virginia.",
      "The White House is also \"concerned\" and has been \u201chyper-focused\u201d on the race, according to a senior Republican source in close contact with the White House.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump, who first backed Fine ahead of the January primary, reiterated his endorsement on Truth Social last week. He also boosted Republican Jimmy Patronis, who is running in an April 1 special election in Florida's 1st District to replace GOP former Rep. Matt Gaetz, on Monday, encouraging his supporters to head to the polls.",
      "Trump\u2019s political orbit has directly been guiding Fine\u2019s campaign. Fine\u2019s top consultant is Chris Grant, who worked for the pro-Trump super PAC MAGA Inc. during the 2024 election cycle, and his top pollster is Tony Fabrizio, who has long done work for Trump, including last year. Rapid Loop Consulting, a firm co-founded by White House deputy chief of staff James Blair, is advising a super PAC backing Fine\u2019s campaign. Blair is no longer involved with the firm, which is run by his former business partner, Ryan Smith.",
      "Florida\u2019s 6th Congressional District seat has been vacant since Jan. 20, when Waltz resigned from Congress to become Trump\u2019s national security adviser, leaving House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., with a historically small majority.",
      "Fine has a prickly reputation even among Florida Republicans. Many of those who have worked with him over the years aren\u2019t surprised that he is at risk of underperforming in a solidly Republican area.",
      "\u201cThis race is proof that candidates matter,\u201d said a veteran Florida GOP operative, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cRandy will win because the seat is so Republican and because so much money came in late, but this is a case of Team Trump dragging him over the finish line.\u201d",
      "Another longtime Florida Republican said that for state-level Republicans \u201cthere would be no tears shed for Fine if he snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,\u201d though the person acknowledged a victory is important because of Republicans\u2019 slim House majority.",
      "Patronis, Florida's chief financial officer and the Republican running to replace Gaetz, was also significantly outraised by his Democratic opponent. Patronis pulled in $1.1 million, compared with gun control activist Gay Valimont\u2019s $6.4 million, in the most recent fundraising period.",
      "But the 1st District race hasn\u2019t raised the same level of concerns, given Patronis\u2019 stronger fundraising and the district\u2019s redder hue \u2014 Trump carried the seat by 37 points, according to election results data from NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk.",
      "Still, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said the fundraising gaps are a sign that \u201cthe American people are not buying what the Republicans are selling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese districts are so Republican there would ordinarily be no reason to believe that the races will be close, but what I can say almost guaranteed is that the Democratic candidate in both of these Florida special elections will significantly overperform,\u201d Jeffries told reporters.",
      "Republicans have scrambled to match Democrats\u2019 spending on the Florida airwaves in recent days. Defend American Jobs, a super PAC tied to the cryptocurrency industry, and an outside group called Conservative Fighter PAC have launched ads in both races within the last week, according to AdImpact.",
      "Both groups have touted Trump\u2019s endorsements of Fine and Patronis in ads.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t heard real concerns that either of them are going to lose,\u201d said a GOP strategist, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the races. \u201cBut there are certainly concerns that they\u2019re underperforming and whether it\u2019s a harbinger of something this cycle.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Following a healthy diet \u2014\u00a0one primarily plant-based, with minimal ultra-processed food and low to moderate amounts of animal-based foods like fish and dairy \u2014 can raise the chances of reaching age 70 without developing a chronic disease, according to a new study.",
      "The research, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, analyzed the diets of more than 105,000 people in midlife and found that by 70, less than 10% had achieved \u201chealthy aging,\u201d meaning their memories were intact, they hadn\u2019t developed depression or a major chronic condition, and they could perform basic physical tasks like climbing stairs or carrying groceries.",
      "Eating healthy, the analysis showed, increased participants\u2019 likelihood of reaching that milestone. That held true for eight specific diets evaluated, including the Mediterranean diet and strictly plant-based regimens, as well as diets designed to lower inflammation or blood pressure.",
      "\u201cWhat most of these diets had in common was that they were rich in fruit and vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fat, nuts, legumes and then low in processed meat, sugars and trans fat,\u201d said an author of the study, Marta Guasch-Ferr\u00e9, an adjunct associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "Previous studies have similarly found that diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with lower cholesterol and blood pressure and a decreased risk of heart disease or cancer. But most of that research hasn\u2019t evaluated the overall effect on people\u2019s quality of life as they age, Guasch-Ferr\u00e9 said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about living longer but also maintaining good health in the later stages of life,\u201d she said.",
      "The link between a healthy diet and lower disease risk is a major talking point for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeatedly blamed food additives and processed food consumption for rising rates of chronic disease in the United States.",
      "The new study evaluated participants ages 39 to 69 over 30 years from 1986 to 2016. The group was selected from two databases of health professionals, so it may skew more health-conscious than average. In addition to evaluating people\u2019s mental and physical fitness at age 70, the researchers screened for 11 chronic conditions, including cancer, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease.",
      "In particular, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index \u2014 a diet designed to reduce chronic disease \u2014 had the strongest association with healthy aging. The index awards high scores to people who consume small amounts of fish, at least five daily servings of vegetables and at least four daily servings of whole fruits while cutting out red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice.",
      "Participants who scored the highest on the Alternative Healthy Eating Index had an 86% greater likelihood of healthy aging, the study found, compared with participants with the lowest scores.",
      "The U.S. dietary guidelines don\u2019t adhere completely to the index, recommending instead at least three vegetable servings and at least two fruit servings per day, plus protein from lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans or nuts.",
      "All eight diets in the study promoted fruits, vegetables and whole grains over red and processed meats. But there are slight differences: For instance, the Mediterranean diet emphasizes healthy fats such as olive oil, fish and nuts, while the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet prioritizes low-sodium foods. The MIND diet, a combination of those two, encourages people to eat berries to promote brain health.",
      "While past research has found numerous health benefits associated with vegetarian or vegan diets, Guasch-Ferr\u00e9 said the study\u2019s findings suggest that middle-aged people don\u2019t need to be fully vegetarian to stave off disease.",
      "\u201cWe can reduce our intake of animal food, but still, some amounts may be healthy,\u201d she said.",
      "The study doesn\u2019t address whether a healthy diet in midlife can reverse the negative effects of a poor diet in childhood or young adulthood \u2014\u00a0a question researchers hope to answer.",
      "\u201cWith respect to many lifestyle factors, our mantra typically is it\u2019s never too early and it\u2019s never too late,\u201d said Stephen Kritchevsky, a professor of gerontology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "Diet isn\u2019t the only factor that affects aging, he added \u2014\u00a0physical activity, stress and a person\u2019s genetics can also play roles.",
      "\u201cIf people want to age healthily, the top four things in my mind are: maintain a healthy weight, get exercise, eat well \u2026 and don\u2019t smoke,\u201d Kritchevsky said."

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the Texas A&M University System from enforcing a ban on drag performances on its campuses.",
      "The Texas A&M Board of Regents passed a resolution last month that prohibited drag shows in campus venues, arguing at the time, according to court documents, that drag shows could violate President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order prohibiting federal funds from being used to promote \u201cgender ideology.\u201d",
      "As a result of the resolution, Texas A&M\u2019s flagship campus in College Station canceled \u201cDraggieland,\u201d an annual drag performance scheduled for Thursday in a campus theater. The Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council, an LGBTQ student group that has sponsored the event for the past five years, sued, arguing that the ban on drag performances violates the First Amendment.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal of the Southern District of Texas said the students\u2019 claim is likely to succeed and issued a temporary injunction that will allow the performance to go on as scheduled while litigation continues.",
      "\u201cBy permitting Draggieland to be held on campus, in the theatre used for a wide variety of events and performances, for those who want to attend and have bought tickets to do so, the Board does not imply that it endorses Draggieland\u2019s message,\u201d Rosenthal wrote in her opinion. \u201cInstead, the Board is complying with the constitutional obligation to allow different messages and viewpoints, including those viewed as offensive to some, to be expressed at a university that is committed to critical thought about a wide range of conflicting and divergent viewpoints and ideologies.\u201d",
      "The Queer Empowerment Council said in a statement that it is \u201coverjoyed\u201d with the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is another display of the resilience of queer joy, as that is an unstoppable force despite those that wish to see it destroyed,\u201d the group said. \u201cWhile this fight isn\u2019t over, we are going to appreciate the joy we get to bring by putting on the best show that we can do.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Texas A&M University System said the school has received the judge\u2019s opinion and is reviewing its options and potential next steps.",
      "The decision is yet another blow against policies that seek to restrict drag performances. In 2023, a federal judge struck down a Texas law that LGBTQ advocates feared would ban drag shows, and judges also blocked a similar law in Montana that targeted drag shows and events where drag performers read books to children. However, in Tennessee, a federal appeals court last year allowed a law restricting drag to stand, reversing a lower court ruling.",
      "Texas A&M\u2019s Board of Regents, in addition to arguing that allowing drag performances on campus could violate Trump\u2019s order regarding \u201cgender ideology,\u201d also said such performances violate the university\u2019s mission to respect others. Drag, the board said, involves men dressing in women\u2019s clothing, wearing exaggerated makeup and prosthetics and performing in a way that \u201cdemeans women.\u201d",
      "The performances could \u201ccontribute to a hostile environment for women contrary to System anti-discrimination policy and Title IX,\u201d the university said, citing a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs, according to court documents.",
      "Rosenthal, however, said that the board didn\u2019t show any evidence that \u201cDraggieland\u201d has contributed to an increase in the harassment of female students over the last five years the Queer Empowerment Council has held the performance and that the record didn\u2019t show that any female students had complained.",
      "In addition, Rosenthal said the board couldn\u2019t show evidence that Trump\u2019s executive order regarding \u201cgender ideology\u201d applies to drag shows \u201cor that the Draggieland message denies the existence of the male and female sexes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe QEC\u2019s complaint makes clear that by donning clothing and makeup traditionally associated with the opposite sex, Draggieland performers intend to convey a message of LGBTQ+ support by engaging in a protected art form,\u201d Rosenthal wrote. \u201cThe performers are just that: performers. They are acting. The performance is theater. It is not about individuals seeking to change their biological sex or claim a different biological sex. It is about actors who perform dressed differently than their biological sex. Again, the Board\u2019s argument conflates the existence of two sexes with different ways to express sexuality and sexual themes.\u201d",
      "Rosenthal added, \u201cTo ban the performance from taking place on campus because it offends some members of the campus community is precisely what the First Amendment prohibits.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/plight-boys-men-democrats-wes-moore-gretchen-whitmer-rcna197129",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 21:30:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Democratic Governors Wes Moore, Gretchen Whitmer and Ned Lamont are highlighting the plight of men and boys. Experts say it's badly needed and could help the party with male voters.",
    "story": [
      "For Democrats, reaching male voters became a political necessity after last fall\u2019s election, when young men swung significantly toward President Donald Trump.",
      "But for some \u2014 like Maryland Gov. Wes Moore \u2014 it\u2019s also a personal goal. The first-term governor, who has spoken about his own struggles as a teenager, recently announced plans to direct his \u201centire administration\u201d to find ways to help struggling boys and men.",
      "\u201cThe well-being of our young men and boys has not been a societal priority,\u201d Moore said in an interview. \u201cI want Maryland to be the one that is aggressive and unapologetic about being able to address it and being able to fix it.\u201d",
      "Moore\u2019s not the only Democrat vowing to help boys and men.",
      "In her State of the State address, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shared plans to help boost young men\u2019s enrollment in higher education and skills training. And Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced what he called \u201ca DEI initiative, which folks on both sides of the aisle may appreciate,\u201d to get more men into teaching.",
      "The announcements come at a critical time. Researchers have argued that the widening gender gap reflects a crisis that, if not addressed, could push men toward extremism. And Democratic pollsters fret that if liberal politicians, in particular, do not address these issues, the party is at risk of losing more men to the GOP.",
      "\u201cWhen Trump talks about fixing the economy and being strong, they hear someone who gets it,\u201d said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics, and an adviser to Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they trust him. But it does mean he\u2019s speaking to their reality in a way most Democrats aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Kamala Harris often spoke about issues of importance to women, emphasizing reproductive rights, for instance, and paid family leave policies. But soul-searching over her loss has prompted Democrats to reach out more aggressively to men, by engaging more with sports, for instance, and looking for ways to make the party seem less \u201cuncool\u201d to young voters.",
      "Shauna Daly, a Democratic strategist and co-founder of the Young Men Research Project, said candidates need to do more than show young men that they can hang. \u201cWhere the Democratic Party has really fallen short with this cohort is that they don\u2019t feel like Democrats are fighting for them,\u201d she said.",
      "They need policies like those the governors have proposed, Daly said, that address men's tangible problems.",
      "In every state, women earn more college degrees than men. Boys are more likely to be disciplined in class, and less likely to graduate high school on time than girls. Men die by suicide at higher rates than women and are more likely to rely on illicit drugs and alcohol. And while women increasingly participate in the workforce at higher rates, men have steadily dropped out of the labor market.",
      "The governors\u2019 speeches touched on many of these issues, and\u00a0earned cautious applause from masculinity researchers, who said they reflected a promising shift.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s part of a growing recognition among Democrats that neglecting the problems of boys and men is neither good policy nor good politics,\u201d said Richard Reeves, founder of the American Institute for Boys and Men, who has informally advised Moore\u2019s staff.\u00a0\u201cIf Democrats weren\u2019t thinking about male voters, and especially young male voters, then it would be a pretty serious dereliction of duty, looking at the polls.\u201d",
      "In the past, Democrats might have been wary of targeting programs toward boys and men for fear of excluding girls. Whitmer seemed aware of this dynamic in her speech,\u00a0when she followed her announcement about young men with a shoutout to women and a vow not to abandon her \u201ccommitment to equal opportunity and dignity for everyone.\u201d",
      "A handful of other states, including some run by Republican governors, have already launched initiatives targeting men in recent years. Utah established a task force that aims to help \u201cmen and boys lead flourishing lives,\u201d and North Dakota created the position of a men\u2019s health coordinator to study and raise awareness of disparities affecting men.",
      "Moore said he was partly inspired by his own experience growing up in the Bronx after his father passed. He has described how troubles in his youth \u2014 including a brush with the police for vandalism, skipping school and getting poor grades \u2014 led his mother to send him away to military school, which he credits with helping him straighten up.",
      "\u201cIt is very personal for me, because I was one of those young men and boys that we\u2019re trying to reach,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I felt like so many of the conversations that were being had about me were not being had with me.\u201d",
      "Moore will hold a cabinet meeting in April to discuss plans for the state agencies, but he has some initial goals: to encourage more men in his state to pursue jobs in education and health care, help boys within the juvenile justice system, and make sure he solicits input from boys and men on how the initiatives are designed.",
      "For Della Volpe, from the Harvard Kennedy School, the governors\u2019 announcements are encouraging. \u201cThe truth is, young men are speaking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been telling us they want respect, opportunity, and strength. If Democrats don\u2019t listen \u2014 and act \u2014 they\u2019ll keep losing ground. But this moment offers hope.\u201d"

      "\u201cAt this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\u201d the National Security Council said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "The statement came in response to an article published Monday by The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, a veteran national security and foreign affairs journalist. Goldberg reported he had been added to a group chat called \u201cHouthi PC small group\u201d on March 13 via Signal, an encrypted messaging service widely believed to be more secure than other commercial texting applications.",
      "Goldberg reported that he went on to receive a series of messages on Signal that appeared to come from Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and other prominent officials in the Trump administration.",
      "Goldberg reported that he exited the Signal group after he personally concluded it was \u201calmost certainly real.\u201d",

      "Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said:\u00a0\u201cEvery single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime \u2014 even if accidentally \u2014 that would normally involve a jail sentence.\u201d",

      "4 hurdles facing Republicans as they shift focus to a bill to pass Trump's agenda",
      "By Sahil Kapur",
      "Congress is back after weeklong recess with Republicans planning to shift focus to a party-line bill to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar agenda after having dispensed with a separate government funding deadline.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson has set a target of passing the legislation through the House in April before the Easter recess, which leaves Republicans in the House with three weeks \u2014 and a lot of work. And then the bill would go to the Senate, which has a different idea of how to proceed.",
      "Here are four hurdles they face.",
      "Medicaid cuts: A recent analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that it\u2019s mathematically impossible for House Republicans to meet their own budget targets without cutting Medicare or Medicaid.",
      "Pursuing hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts would put swing-district Republicans in a politically precarious position. But abandoning those cuts would anger hard-line conservatives who voted for the budget blueprint to begin the process because they were promised steep spending reductions.",
      "A $4.6 trillion asterisk? Extending Trump\u2019s expiring 2017 tax cuts would cost $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the CBO. And that\u2019s before tackling Trump\u2019s other pursuits, like ending taxes on tips and overtime pay.",
      "To get around the problem, Republicans are considering a far-reaching accounting change to hide the deficit impact, known as \u201ccurrent policy baseline,\u201d instead of \u201ccurrent law baseline,\u201d which would treat the cost of making Trump\u2019s tax cuts permanent as $0. Democrats are preparing to fight that with the parliamentarian, the in-house referee overseeing the reconciliation process.",
      "House-Senate divide: The two chambers adopted conflicting budget resolutions before Trump sided with the House version. On Monday, House GOP leaders called on the Senate to adopt the House measure. But Republican senators are waiting to see whether the House can deliver on the actual bill. Despite the paper-thin House majority, senators are in no mood to let the House dictate the outcome.",
      "Debt limit: The exact date by which Congress will need to act to raise the debt ceiling this year is still unknown. House lawmakers\u2019 budget plan called for a $4 trillion increase in the debt ceiling, but they need to pass the reconciliation bill to make it official. That means they\u2019ll have to send the legislation to Trump\u2019s desk before the deadline or risk economic calamity.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 21:18:23 GMT",
    "summary": "The brother of Jhon Chacin, a Venezuelan asylum-seeker, is seeking answers as the Venezuelan government calls for the deportees' release from an El Salvador prison.",
    "story": [
      "Were it not for bad weather, Jhon Chacin would have been aboard a flight to his native Venezuela on March 13, having volunteered to go home after giving up on an asylum request that was initially denied. Instead, his brother said, Jhon was among the nearly 300 Venezuelan men sent by U.S. immigration officials to El Salvador's notorious megaprison.",
      "Eudomar Chacin spoke to his brother the day after he was supposed to have returned to Venezuela; because of bad weather they couldn't board the flight, Jhon said. According to Eudomar, Jhon, 35, was crying and told him he was scared because he was seeing unusual movements by staff at the detention center in Texas where he was being held. Eudomar hasn't heard from him since.",
      "\u201cI just feel like crying all the time \u2014 he is a good, healthy kid, he didn\u2019t have any vices, he is Christian, my family is all Christian,\" Eudomar, who's 56 and lives in Florida, told NBC News. \"I want justice and freedom for my brother. And I want him to return to Venezuela.\u201d",
      "Like Eudomar, families of the men who were whisked away have been grappling with the horror of relatives suddenly going \"missing\" amid the politically charged U.S. government operation, as more relatives and attorneys push for answers and for their release.",
      "At the same time, Venezuela's government is demanding that the deported men be released and returned to their country.",
      "Millions have left Venezuela over the last decade, fleeing poverty and repression under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But following the U.S. deportation flights of Venezuelan men to the Salvadoran megaprison, Maduro vowed to \"rescue our young people who are kidnapped, missing, without having committed a crime neither in the United States nor in El Salvador,\" and put in \"Nazi-style concentration camps.\"",
      "Maduro announced over the weekend that his government would begin accepting repatriation flights after a brief suspension on March 8, and following the U.S Treasury's announcement that it was withdrawing Chevron's license to export Venezuelan oil.",
      "Eudomar said he learned that his brother was in the Salvadoran prison because he spotted him in a Trump administration video of the mass relocation. Jhon's name also appeared on a list of those sent to the El Salvador prison that was published by CBS News. Seeing his name on the list left the family feeling \"powerless,\" Eudomar said.",
      "The Trump administration has claimed that it purged the country of members of Tren de Aragua gang members, backing its assertions with video of the men, chained and bent under the force of armed guards as they were shuffled from planes to the prison in the dark of night on March 15 and 16.",
      "Families and attorneys of five other Venezuelan immigrants sent to El Salvador\u2019s mega-prison have told NBC News, Telemundo and MSNBC that their relatives were unjustly targeted and accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang based on having ordinary tattoos that don't necessarily signal gang affiliation, according to experts.",
      "Jhon entered the U.S. through the CBP One app on Oct. 8, 2024, in San Ysidro, California; the app, launched by the Biden administration and terminated by President Donald Trump, was the only way to request asylum at the border. Since then, he had been held in detention in San Diego and later transferred to Texas.",
      "Before he left Venezuela, Jhon had spent 10 years working as a tattoo artist in the state of Zulia, using his own body as a canvas to show clients his talent, his brother said. Jhon left Venezuela at the end of 2022, and spent a year working in Colombia before making his way to Mexico through the dangerous jungles of the Dari\u00e9n Gap. He arrived in Mexico in May 2024, and waited five months for his CBP One appointment.",
      "Eudomar said that his brother was often asked about his tattoos by U.S. authorities while he was in detention. He lost his asylum case and was planning to appeal. But when Trump became president and Jhon learned more about Trump\u2019s hard-line policies, he decided to sign papers to voluntarily be sent back to Venezuela.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to NBC News'  request for comment around Jhon's case.",
      "Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the deportation of noncitizens in wartime, declaring that the U.S. was under invasion by the Tren de Aragua gang. With that law in use, those in custody are removed with no chance to disprove any gang affiliation or go forward with asylum claims or other immigration processes.",
      "Unable to communicate with the deportees, many of their relatives are increasingly desperate to speak on their behalf and are aiming to present a different portrait of their loved ones than the one presented by the administration.",
      "The families and attorneys are contending with what legal and immigration experts say is an unprecedented action by the U.S. \u2014 sending migrants to detention in a third country.",
      "\u201cThat is a very unusual act,\u201d Veronica Cardenas, former assistant legal counsel for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told MSNBC on Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re not just being removed to El Salvador, they\u2019re being removed to be placed in detention centers and prolonging their detention, something that would be very illegal if they decided to do that\u00a0here\u00a0in the United States.\"",
      "On Monday, U.S. District Judge\u00a0James Boasberg denied the government\u2019s request to lift his hold on deportations made under the Alien Enemies Act, while a federal appeals court heard  arguments from the Trump administration defending use of the wartime-law deportations.",
      "One of the federal appeals court judges, U.S. Circuit Judge Patricia Millet, pressed administration lawyers about their use of the wartime law, saying deportees weren\u2019t given any due process before they were removed from the U.S., weren\u2019t told where they were being sent and weren't given an opportunity to dispute they were part of the Tren de Aragua gang. \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act,\" Millet said.",
      "Trump also announced he would impose a 25% tariff on any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela, because the country has sent \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of people to the United States who have a \u201cvery violent nature.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The family of University of Missouri student Riley Strain has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his fraternity, accusing Delta Chi of instilling a code that taught brothers \u201cto abandon one another.\u201d",
      "The suit was filed in Boone County Circuit Court on Friday, almost a year to the day after Strain\u2019s body was found in the Cumberland River in Nashville, following an extensive two-week search.",
      "Strain, 22, had traveled to Nashville with fellow Delta Chi members for a spring formal, an annual event that the lawsuit described as involving \u201cprolific consumption of alcohol.\u201d Much of it was above 15% alcohol by volume, the suit said, even though Delta Chi\u2019s risk management policy prohibits beverages with such high alcohol content from being served at fraternity events.",
      "The suit names Delta Chi and more than two dozen fraternity leaders and members as defendants, accusing them of negligence that it says led to Strain\u2019s death.",
      "It accuses the fraternity of failing to ensure that the chapter was following a strict safety protocol, failing to enforce its written policies and \u201cinstilling a code into its fraternity members that encouraged or taught fraternity \u2018brothers\u2019 to abandon one another instead of helping one another,\u201d among other allegations.",
      "The suit accuses the fraternity members of encouraging Strain to continue drinking \u201cafter it became apparent that he was acting in an unusual way,\u201d failing to arrange a ride back to the hotel for him after he got kicked out of a bar when he was out with fraternity friends and delaying a 911 call to report him missing.",
      "A representative for Delta Chi did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did attorneys for Strain\u2019s family. At the time of Strain\u2019s death, Delta Chi released a statement saying it was \u201cdeeply saddened by the tragic passing of our esteemed fraternity brother\u201d and said that it was providing support and resources to those affected.",
      "An attorney for the family, Jacob Lewis, declined to comment, as did Strain\u2019s stepfather, Christopher Whiteid, who is one of four plaintiffs. The other three plaintiffs \u2014 Strain\u2019s mother, Michelle Whiteid, his father, Robert Gilbert, and his stepmother, Melissa Gilbert \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The legal complaint describes Strain as an \u201coften-reserved young man that did not tend to go with the typical fraternity flow,\u201d whose fraternity brothers convinced him to come on the chartered bus trip to Nashville for the formal. On the bus ride from Columbia, Missouri, the suit said, Delta Chi members served beer and jello shots they had made with vodka, which has well over 15% alcohol by volume.",
      "The lawsuit goes on to say that Strain was offered several drinks, and fraternity members noticed him having difficulty speaking and walking within hours of arriving in Nashville, but brought him along as they went bar-hopping. When a bar made Strain leave later that night, his fraternity brothers \u201cchose to continue partying\u201d instead of making sure he was safe, the lawsuit states.",
      "\u201cRather than having the support of his brothers, Riley was abandoned and alone,\u201d it said.",
      "Instead of heading toward the hotel, Strain made a wrong turn and began walking toward the river, the lawsuit said. When his hotel roommates returned around 1 a.m. and saw he had not completed what should have been a 12-minute walk back to the hotel despite leaving the bar about three hours earlier, there was \u201cno search, no panic,\u201d and no call made to 911, according to the suit.",
      "\u201cThe fraternity brothers did not even think to call Riley\u2019s parents, they simply got ready for bed and went to sleep,\u201d it said, adding Strain\u2019s parents and police in Nashville were notified the following afternoon.",
      "Strain was eventually found facedown in the Cumberland River. An autopsy report revealed he died \u201cas a result of drowning and ethanol intoxication,\u201d also known as alcohol poisoning.",
      "Luke\u2019s 32 Bridge Food + Drink in Nashville, the bar that Strain was last seen at, released a statement last year while Strain was still missing saying that he was served one alcoholic drink and two glasses of water before he was escorted out by security \u201cbased on our conduct standards.\u201d",
      "The autopsy report said his death appeared to be accidental and did not indicate any signs of foul play.",
      "Strain\u2019s family is seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages plus compensation for the pain and suffering Strain experienced before he died."

A few moments later, Lola came back in with her mom, Carnie Wilson, and her aunt, Wendy Wilson.

      "Her family then walked off to the side, setting the stage for Lola, 19, to audition on her own by covering Kacey Musgraves\u2019 \u201cRainbow.\u201d",
      "Lola certainly didn\u2019t need any family to help make an impression, either.",

      "\u201cThe tone and the pureness and the quality of your voice, that\u2019s a perfect song for you. But this competition is going to require you to belt, too, and kind of let loose a little bit, fill up the room a little more and using your dynamics. But you got a really, really beautiful voice,\u201d Bryan said.",
      "\u201cYou have an honesty in your voice and in your presence. I want to see you own your talent and everything that you have to offer, because you have a lot to offer. And it makes me really excited to get to potentially bear witness to that,\u201d Underwood said.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m on the show, I will push myself. That\u2019s why I want to be on \u2018American Idol.\u2019 I want to grow,\u201d Lola said.",

      "This marks the second time this season a pop star has joined a child for an \"American Idol\" audition. Earlier this month, Backstreet Boys star Brian Littrell teamed up with his son, Baylee, who also made it to the next round.",
      "Time will tell how far Lola makes it in the competition, but mom Carnie Wilson was delighted that she wanted to try out because she's growing as an artist.",
      "\"She's got something so honest and pure and lovely,\" she told \"Entertainment Tonight.\"",
      "\"I could not be more excited for her,\" she added.",
      "For those keeping score, \"Hold On\" was one of Wilson Phillips' biggest hits. It spent one week atop the Billboard Hot 100, joining \"Release Me\" and \"You're in Love\" as tracks that went to No. 1 on the chart for the group."

At night, the contestants sit around the dinner table and choose who they think holds the prize. Whoever receives the most votes is eliminated. If successful, the pot is reshuffled to a remaining contestant. If not, the millionaire lives to see another day.",
      "The millionaire also has their own secret agenda that they can complete to gain an advantage during eliminations. However, they must tread lightly as the other contestants are looking out for any odd behaviors that might give the millionaire away.",

      "\u201cWe have the Steffy\u00a0(Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) and Taylor (Rebecca Budig)\u00a0characters, and they\u2019re kind of in a state of euphoria because they\u2019ve pulled off something that\u2019s very dear to them and it worked,\u201d Tom tells TODAY.com of the mother-daughter duo. \u201cAnd then we have the Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) and the Hope (Annika Noelle) characters who are just kind of in complete and utter turmoil. So it\u2019s a nice juxtaposition between the two.\u201d",

      "\u201cI was able to get a little bit of an homage to my mother, who passed away last year,\" she says, calling the experience \"really special.\"",
      "Tom describes her mother as a \"very determined\" and \"very smart\" woman, calling her \"the reason\" she's in the entertainment industry.",
      "Directing and acting in the episode after writing it was a challenge for Tom, who made her directorial debut on \"B&B\" in 2016. Since then, she's directed over 30 times and written multiple episodes of the show. In addition to her work on \u201cB&B,\u201d Tom has also directed episodes of \u201cThe Young and the Restless,\u201d \u201cDynasty\u201d and \u201cGood Trouble.\u201d",

      "Tom worked alongside another female director to map out all the shots and had a monitor on set to help her keep track of her own scenes while she was acting.",
      "\"It's a very emotional show. I really wanted to make sure that our scenes were blocked and really rehearsed so that the actresses who had to be so emotional knew that they could just get it in one shot,\" she says.",

      "Tom's career is certainly one that's worth celebrating. Before joining the cast of \"B&B\" in 2007, the actor appeared on \"One Life to Live\" and \"All My Children.\" She also starred as Victoria Newman on \"The Young and the Restless\" alongside Joshua Morrow, who played her on-screen brother Nick Newman.",
      "In 2024, Morrow's son Crew Morrow joined the cast of \"B&B\" as Tom's on-screen son, creating a \"full-circle\" moment for Tom, especially since her new co-star's mannerisms often remind her of his father.",

      "Tom also appreciates her character\u2019s postpartum depression storyline.",
      "\u201cGranted, she had postpartum psychosis, so it was way extreme, but I just feel like it\u2019s still really one of the last things that is kind of taboo to talk about.\u00a0I think so many women go through it, and they feel like they can\u2019t talk about it because somehow it\u2019s going to mean you\u2019re a bad mother or that you don\u2019t love your kid. And it\u2019s really not about that at all,\" she says.",

      "Acting wasn't always Cooper's dream. Originally, he told Variety, he wanted to be a professional soccer player, but felt compelled to take acting lessons years ago.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know what it was that made me want to do it, but I just wanted to do it,\" he said.",
      "After signing with an agency, his self-tape for \"Adolescence\" launched his career.",
      "What has Owen Cooper said about 'Adolescence'?",
      "Cooper told Vanity Fair that he is the \u201ccomplete opposite\u201d of Jamie, but he had to put himself in Jamie\u2019s shoes for the part. Cooper detailed filming the scene in which his onscreen parents Eddie (Stephen Graham) and Manda Miller (Christine Tremarco) first see Jamie get arrested.",
      "\u201cSteven and Christine are banging on the window, saying, \u2018We\u2019re here!\u2019\u201d Cooper told Vanity Fair. \u201cAnd, I don\u2019t know, that just really got me ... I looked at them as my mum and dad. It made me think I was all on my own and I was just isolated from all my parents. So I don\u2019t really think of it as\u00a0being\u00a0Jamie. I think of it as myself in that situation.\u201d",
      "In a video shared by Netflix, Cooper reacted to his own audition tape \u2014 cringing at the acting and his hair.",
      "\"I hated that,\" Cooper said, watching the moment back.",
      "Despite disliking watching himself at his audition, Cooper told Variety that he's watched his performance in the show.",
      "\"Everyone\u2019s been saying such nice things,\" he said. \"My agent has seen it and she said it was really good. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I don\u2019t really watch it like I\u2019m watching a normal show. I just watch it because I\u2019m in it. So, I don\u2019t know. But everyone who has spoken to me has said it\u2019s amazing. So yeah, I\u2019ve heard positive things.\"",
      "Each episode of \"Adolescence\" was shot in one take \u2013 a challenge for any actor. But Cooper said in a video for Netflix that if he could, he would always film in that style.",
      "\"Because when you're like cutting and stopping and stuff, you wouldn't get that full \u2014 you wouldn't get the full emotion,\" he said.",
      "Cooper told Vogue that he only had two weeks to learn all the lines.",
      "\u201cI still question how I did that, to be honest ... There was so much highlighting you could barely read the lines,\" he said.",
      "What have the cast and creators of 'Adolescence' said about Owen Cooper?",
      "Stephen Graham, the series' co-creator, co-writer and star, told TODAY producers auditioned \u201cover 500 young boys\u201d for the part of Jamie. They wanted to cast an unknown actor to \u201ccreate an opportunity for someone,\" he said \u2014 and Cooper was the perfect fit.",
      "\u201cHe came and he was off book, he\u2019s just phenomenal,\u201d Graham said.",
      "Cooper's first day on set was filming Episode 3, a conversation between Jamie and therapist Briony Ariston (Erin Doherty).",
      "The scene took 11 takes and resulted in a harrowing performance from Cooper. In the scene, Jamie appears to unmask himself and show how he might be capable of taking someone's life. Doherty called the performance \"genuinely scary.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m so proud of Owen because I got to see him push himself as an actor, to really go there,\" she said. \"Back then, he was this kid and he didn\u2019t want to be this scary thing, especially with someone he just met. So, we really had to work on creating this safe space to let him know that he\u2019s going to be fine. To think about that kid versus the one that turned up in that 11th take, and push those buttons and pushed himself, I\u2019m just so proud.\"",
      "In an interview with Vanity Fair, Graham compared Cooper's performance in \"Adolescence\" to Ed Norton's breakout in \"Primal Fear,\" and said that Cooper reminded him of a young Jodie Comer.",
      "\u201cWhat I saw in Owen was the exact same thing I saw in\u00a0Jodie Comer\u00a0when Jodie was 17,\" he said. \u201cI saw the same kind of ability, the same kind of natural talent, and just a real presence ... He just blew my mind.\u201d",
      "\"Adolescence\" director Philip Barantini praised Cooper\u2019s performance to Variety, saying, \u201cActors train for years and years and still can\u2019t really master what Owen has done.\u201d",
      "What's next for Owen Cooper?",
      "The actor already has two more roles lined up.",
      "Cooper is set to appear as Callum in an upcoming TV miniseries called \"Film Club\" which is about sparks flying between two film club members. It's set to debut this year on BBC iPlayer\u00a0and\u00a0BBC Three and is written by Aimee Lou Wood, who is currently starring in Season 3 of \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "Cooper has also been tapped to play young Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell's adaptation of \"Wuthering Heights.\" The older version of Heathcliff will be played by Jacob Elordi, starring opposite Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw.",
      "Cooper told Variety that Graham helped him land the role of Healthcliff. Graham recommended Cooper to his agent, then gave the agent Episode 1 of \"Adolescence\" to watch.",
      "\"I got 'Wuthering Heights' from that!\" Cooper said."

Is there a different power dynamic between him and Lochy? Is Lochy coming on to him? Is it the drugs? Is it the girls pressuring him?\u00a0What\u00a0is it?

      "The 63-year-old opened up in an interview with the Sunday Times about how her life has changed since landing a starring role on \u201cThe White Lotus.\u201d While chatting with the British newspaper, Coolidge reflected on her breakout role in \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d in 1999 and said now, fans recognize her for her character in the hit HBO series.",

      "\u201cI sabotaged myself, and I\u2019d say this to any young person: when the wave comes, have the guts to stay on. I would beg people to, you know, blow off your wedding and take that job,\u201d she told the Sunday Times. \u201cI was a sure bet, I got so many good jobs in a row. I have huge regrets \u2014 I was deeply depressed for a very long time.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt was guys and, well, everyone wants certain things in their life at a certain time. I was trying to have relationships with men who were unavailable, or there are guys out there who really hate women deep down and I certainly dated them,\u201d she added.",
      "Over the years, the extended lull in her career also continued to affect her dating pool.\u00a0She recalled a man approaching her on the street in New Orleans and asking her out before she was cast on \u201cThe White Lotus.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a few years ago and he had a T-shirt on that his belly came out of, plus red cowboy boots.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s eerie, creepy, I\u2019m worried for everybody,\u201d she said, having only seen two episodes of Season Three at the time. \u201cGreg (Jon Gries) is in the first episode! I hope something bad happens to him.\u201d",
      "As for her reaction when she found out last year that Tanya \u2014 the fan-favorite character who helped her earn two Emmys, a Golden Globe and more \u2014 wouldn\u2019t return for the next season?",

For nearly two years, the former child actors have been recapping and reminiscing on episodes from the series, which ran for eight seasons from 1987-1995.",
      "But for a special \u201cminisode\u201d of the podcast March 21, the duo decided to play a game that fans suggested on Reddit. Longtime \u201cFull House\u201d viewers wanted Sweetin and Barber to rank episodes from Season 1, including the best, worst, funniest and more.

      "\u201cBut, again, not as bad as \u2018Sea Cruise,\u2019\u201d Sweetin said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say the \u2018Full House\u2019 pilot is one of the best pilots in sitcom history,\u201d Barber said, making Sweetin gasp. \u201cIt had everything. You immediately know who the characters are, you know their personalities, you know their relationships with each other (and) you know the challenges that they face. It has heart. It\u2019s funny. It has it all, and it has stood the test of time for the last 37 years.\u201d",
      "Sweetin replied, \u201cYou know what, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d She pointed out that there were possibly other episodes that had better storylines, but the pilot, which was titled \u201cOur Very First Show,\u201d is unforgettable.",
      "\u201cThat pilot, I can picture it so vividly, and I know our Fanneritos can as well. Like, what we were wearing (and) what we were doing\u2026That episode is such a memory, such a great episode,\u201d Sweetin said.",
      "Barber named \u201cOur Very First Show\u201d as the funniest episode, too. Sweetin also listed \u201cSisterly Love\u201d and \u201cA Pox in Our House\u201d from Season 1 as other hilarious episodes.",

      "The new film, starring Rachel Zegler as the titular role and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, is the live-action take on the 1937 film, \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\u201d",
      "The plot of the new film doesn't stray far from the original, following Snow White as she escapes from the Evil Queen, who is so threatened by the princess' beauty that she attempts to have her killed. While Snow White is away from the Queen's grasp, she meets seven dwarfs in the forest and falls in love with a man, who she later finds to be be quite charming.",
      "In both films, the Evil Queen won\u2019t cease her efforts to be the \u201cfairest in the land,\u201d disguising herself as an haggard old lady to poison Snow White with an apple. The spell can only be broken by true love\u2019s kiss.",
      "The movies do differ, however, when it comes to the endings. In the original, Snow White is under the spell when the dwarfs trap the Queen on a cliff, where she ultimately falls to her death after being struck by lightning. In the new film, Snow White returns to the castle to defeat the queen herself.",
      "Zegler has previously acknowledged the differences between the two stories. In September 2022, she did an interview\u00a0with Variety, later receiving backlash \u2014 as well as support \u2014 for inadvertently giving an antifeminist sentiment to the original character.",
      "\u201cI just mean that it\u2019s no longer 1937,\u201d Zegler said. \u201cWe absolutely wrote a \u2018Snow White\u2019 that ... she\u2019s not going to be saved by the prince, and she\u2019s not going to be dreaming about true love; she\u2019s going to be dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave and true.\u201d",
      "In a interview\u00a0at the D23 Expo with Extra TV, Zegler compared the two love stories in the films. She described Prince Charming in the original movie as \u201ca guy who literally stalks\u201d Snow White, adding that it was \u201cweird\u201d and said the new film \u201cdidn\u2019t do that this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a different approach to what I\u2019m sure a lot of people will assume is a love story just because we cast a guy in the movie,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s really not about the love story at all, which is really, really wonderful.\u201d",
      "On Rotten Tomatoes, the new picture garnered a 44% rating from critics on the \u201cTomatometer\u201d and a 71% rating from fans on the \u201cPopcornmeter.\u201d The film received a B+ rating from CinemaScore.",

      "Amid its recent controversies, Disney fans have shared their own takes on the new film and how it compares to the classic.",
      "One review on X read, \"#SnowWhite feels like a brand new musical with its wealth of fresh, original songs that bring the story to life. The visuals are vibrant and enchanting and I enjoyed the updates to the classic story. Rachel Zegler and Andrew Burnap\u2019s duet was a stand out, while Gal Gadot does a serviceable job as the Evil Queen.\"",
      "Another user wrote, \"#SnowWhite I sadly left underwhelmed. Zegler is outstanding & her vocal performance really elevated the old & new songs.I even found the dwarfs to be fun. Everything else is just aimless, no real plot, weak villain,& many under developed characters. It\u2019s decent just not memorable.\"",
      "In response to an X post claiming children were \"ignoring\" Zegler when she attended a \"Snow White\" event with young fans, one person shared a sweet video of her chatting with a girl dressed as the character.",
      "The X post read, \"Children love (Zegler) because she is kind and friendly like Snow White, which of course you have none of that.\"",
      "\"RACHEL ZEGLER THE SINGER AND ACTRESS YOU ARE!!!\" another shared on X. \"snow white is soo cute btw dont listen to the haters!!\"",

      "The United States and Russia began a new set of talks Monday aimed at a partial Ukraine ceasefire \u2014 while the two sides disagreed over how well the talks in Saudi Arabia were going and as Kremlin forces launched another night of drone strikes.",
      "Even as Russia's delegation sat down in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the country's military launched missiles at the Ukrainian city of Sumy on Monday, damaging apartment buildings and a children's hospital and injuring 74 people, including 13 children, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "\"A few hours ago, another horrific Russian bombing of Sumy\u2019s city center injured dozens civilians, including many children,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X. \"Instead of making hollow statements about peace, Russia must stop bombing our cities and end its war on civilians. Any diplomacy with Moscow must be backed up by firepower, sanctions, and pressure.\"",
      "Meanwhile, American negotiators said they hope to achieve \u201creal progress\u201d at the talks in Saudi Arabia, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned of \"difficult negotiations.\"",
      "\"There are still many aspects related to the settlement which are to be worked out,\" Peskov told reporters on a media call Monday after Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry published video of its delegation arriving at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh.",
      "The White House is attempting a strategy of \u201cshuttle diplomacy,\u201d a source familiar with the negotiations told NBC News, and was meeting with Russian delegates Monday after having spoken with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia a day before.",
      "Both sides sounded upbeat following those talks, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday calling the discussions \u201cquite useful\u201d and saying his side was working in a \u201ccompletely constructive manner.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, told several broadcast shows the same day that he was hopeful of \u201creal progress.\u201d",
      "But Witkoff had already raised alarm in Europe before both rounds of talks, telling Tucker Carlson's podcast Friday that he didn\u2019t regard Russian President Vladimir Putin \"as a bad guy\u201d and said that Putin counted Trump as a friend.",
      "Putin was reviled as a pariah across the West before Trump began his second term as president in January, not just for launching an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, but for decades of election meddling and aggression abroad, and for brutally silencing political opposition at home.",
      "Sunday brought another reality check to the White House's optimism.",
      "Russia launched 99 drones into Ukraine overnight into Monday and injured at least one person, officials said. The night before, it sent 147 of them across the border, killing three people in the capital, Kyiv, including a father and his 5-year-old daughter, according to Zelenskyy.",
      "Ukraine has increasingly attempted to defend itself by returning fire, and the Russian Minister of Defense said Kremlin forces had intercepted and destroyed 28 drones sent into Russia on Sunday and overnight into Monday.",
      "\u201cEvery night is now a large-scale Russian drone attack,\u201d Zelenskyy said Sunday. \u201cWithout pressure on Russia, they will continue to despise real diplomacy in Moscow and continue to destroy lives,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cNo matter what we talk about with our partners, we need to push Putin to give a real order to stop the strikes: whoever brought this war must take it away.\u201d",
      "There is also an apparent discrepancy in terms of what the three parties say is on the table. The White House has said that \u201cenergy and infrastructure\u201d would be covered by the agreement, while the Kremlin phrases this as \u201cenergy infrastructure.\u201d Zelenskyy has since said he would also like railways and ports to be protected.",
      "On March 11, Putin said he would accept a partial 30-day ceasefire covering energy infrastructure but included demands that would be so punishing for Kyiv as to be tantamount to surrender.",
      "Ukraine is also concerned that an agreement for unrestricted trade with the European Union, of which it is not a member, is set to end June 5.",
      "While Ukrainian finance minister Serhiy Marchenko told the Financial Times that the deal's expiration would damage Ukraine's economy, some E.U. member states have recently opposed the agreement \u2014\u00a0made after Russia's invasion in February 2022 \u2014\u00a0as hurting their own economies."

      "This week, Russian President Vladimir Putin revived the Cold War tradition of taking geopolitics onto the ice, suggesting in a call to President Donald Trump that American and Russian skaters play matches against each other.",
      "While the challenge is yet to be accepted, it\u2019s an\u00a0idea with deep\u00a0 roots in the Soviet era, when hockey became a proxy arena in which to address geopolitical tensions. Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d",
      "But rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sports, experts say.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.",
      "As a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada.",
      "\u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him,\u201d added Smith, who recounted his tale in the book \"Ice War Diplomat: Hockey meets Cold War Politics at the 1972 Summit Series.\"",
      "These overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term.",
      "Until now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.",
      "In the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.",
      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Throughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cpingpong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming, author of the book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",

      "Despite sharing a border with an at-war Russia and receiving limited winter sunlight, the Nordic nation has been ranked the world\u2019s happiest country for the eighth year in a row. Americans, meanwhile, seem to get more unhappy with each passing year.",
      "That\u2019s according to the 2025 World Happiness Report, published Thursday, which ranks over 140 countries and regions based on residents\u2019 self-assessments. The survey was conducted by the University of Oxford in partnership with analytics firm Gallup and the United Nations.",
      "In the rankings of happiness haves and have-nots, the U.S. dropped to its lowest ever spot at No. 24, continuing its decline from a peak of the 11th place over a decade ago. The report described political polarization as a result of growing despair among Americans.",
      "\u201cThe decline in life satisfaction explains the overall rise in anti-system votes but trust in others then comes into play,\u201d the report said, with \u201cunhappy people attracted by the extremes of the political spectrum.\u201d",

      "Despite GDP per capita in the U.S. and Western Europe having continually risen since the mid-2000s, a drop in the happiness of Western democracies \u201ccould be blamed on the feelings of financial insecurity and loneliness experienced by Americans and Europeans \u2014 two symptoms of a damaged social fabric,\u201d the report said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. has lifted bounties on three senior Taliban figures, including the interior minister who also heads a powerful network blamed for bloody attacks against Afghanistan\u2019s former Western-backed government, officials in Kabul said Sunday.",
      "Sirajuddin Haqqani, who acknowledged planning a January 2008 attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul, which killed six people, including U.S. citizen Thor David Hesla, no longer appears on the State Department\u2019s Rewards for Justice website. The FBI website still featured a wanted poster for him on Sunday.",
      "Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani said the U.S. government had revoked the bounties placed on Haqqani, Abdul Aziz Haqqani and Yahya Haqqani.",
      "\u201cThese three individuals are two brothers and one paternal cousin,\u201d Qani told The Associated Press.",
      "The Haqqani network grew into one of the deadliest arms of the Taliban after the U.S.-led 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. The group employed roadside bombs, suicide bombings and other attacks, including on the Indian and U.S. embassies, the Afghan presidency, and other major targets. They also have been linked to extortion, kidnapping and other criminal activity.",
      "A Foreign Ministry official, Zakir Jalaly, said the Taliban\u2019s release of U.S. prisoner George Glezmann on Friday and the removal of bounties showed both sides were \u201cmoving beyond the effects of the wartime phase and taking constructive steps to pave the way for progress\u201d in bilateral relations.",
      "\u201cThe recent developments in Afghanistan-U.S. relations are a good example of the pragmatic and realistic engagement between the two governments,\u201d Jalaly said.",
      "Another official, Shafi Azam, hailed the development as the beginning of normalization, also citing the Taliban\u2019s announcement that they were in control of Afghanistan\u2019s embassy in Norway.",
      "Since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, China has been the most prominent country to accept one of its diplomats. Other countries have accepted de facto Taliban representatives, such as Qatar, which has been a key mediator between the U.S. and the Taliban. U.S. envoys have also met the Taliban.",
      "The Taliban rule, especially bans affecting women and girls, has drawn widespread condemnation and deepened their international isolation.",
      "Haqqani has previously spoken out against the Taliban\u2019s decision-making process, authoritarianism and alienation of the Afghan population.",
      "He has been under U.N. sanctions since 2007, because of his involvement with the network founded by his father, Jalaluddin.",
      "But the global body has allowed him to travel in the past 12 months, including to the United Arab Emirates to meet the country\u2019s leadership and to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage. Those were his first trips abroad since the Taliban takeover.",
      "Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group\u2019s Asia program, said the removal of the bounties was a win for Taliban officials wanting to do business with the international community. The U.S. is showing it can reward those who make compromises within their own remit, even if these compromises don\u2019t translate to national policy, he said.",
      "The international community had made demands of the Taliban, specifically lifting restrictions on women and girls, but offered nothing in return, Bahiss said. Scrapping bounties was a sign that small diplomatic overtures were possible.",
      "While recognition as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan might not immediately be on the horizon, the Taliban views normalization as enough progress given their existing diplomatic inroads in the region, according to Bahiss.",
      "\u201cFor the Taliban, the removal of sanctions is more important than (official) recognition. Sanctions bite. They inhibit your ability to do business, to travel. That\u2019s why they would celebrate this as a victory. The transactional nature of this diplomacy suits both the Taliban and Trump.\u201d",
      "His partial rehabilitation on the international stage is in contrast to the status of the reclusive Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, who could face arrest by the International Criminal Court for his persecution of women."

      "Han took over as acting leader from President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was himself impeached over his short-lived declaration of martial law in December. Following the ruling, Han returns to his acting president position immediately.",
      "\u201cI am grateful for the wise decision made by the Constitutional Court,\u201d Han said after the ruling, thanking members of the cabinet for their hard work while he was suspended.",
      "\u201cWe will work together to prepare and implement responses to global changes, and to ensure that\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u00a0continues to develop well in the era of great geopolitical transformation,\u201d Han said in the televised comments.",
      "Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration plunged Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy and a key U.S. military ally into its greatest political crisis in decades, and created a leadership vacuum amid spiraling impeachments, resignations and criminal indictments for a range of top officials.",
      "Han had initially lasted less than two weeks in the post and was impeached and suspended on Dec. 27 after clashing with the opposition-led parliament by refusing to appoint three more justices to the Constitutional Court.",
      "The justices on the court ruled seven to one to strike down the impeachment on Monday.",
      "Five of the eight justices said the impeachment motion was valid, but there were not enough grounds to impeach Han as he did not violate the constitution or the law, according to a court statement.",
      "Two justices ruled that the impeachment motion against Han, who was acting president at the time, was invalid from the start as two-thirds of lawmakers in parliament did not pass it.",
      "One justice voted to impeach Han.",
      "Han, 75, had served in leadership positions for more than three decades under five presidents, both conservative and liberal.",
      "In a country sharply divided by partisan rhetoric, Han had been seen as a rare example of an official whose varied career transcended party lines.",
      "Still, the opposition-led parliament accused him of not doing enough to thwart Yoon\u2019s decision to declare martial law, an accusation he denied.",
      "Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok assumed the position of acting president while the cases of Yoon and Han were considered by the Constitutional Court.",
      "Parliament impeached Han over his alleged role in the martial law, as well as his refusal to appoint more justices to the Constitutional Court and back special counsel bills targeting Yoon and First Lady Kim Keon Hee.",
      "Han attended the only hearing in the case on Feb. 19, where he denied any role in the martial law episode and called for the court to dismiss the impeachment.",
      "The unexpected imposition of martial law on Dec. 3 by President Yoon and the ensuing political upheaval sent shock waves through Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy, and raised concern among allies such as the United States under former President Joe Biden, who had seen Yoon as a key partner in efforts to counter China and North Korea.",
      "The martial law in the end lasted only about six hours after lawmakers defied a security cordon around parliament and voted to reject the declaration.",
      "The Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling on Yoon\u2019s impeachment is expected within days. Yoon also faces a separate criminal trial on charges of leading an insurrection by declaring martial law.",
      "If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election will be held within 60 days."

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has called for a snap election amid a festering trade war and annexation threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Carney, who was elected by the Liberal Party earlier this month to replace Justin Trudeau following his resignation, called the election for April 28, saying he needs a strong mandate to deal with tariffs issued by the Trump administration and the threat they pose to Canada\u2019s economy. The election was originally set for Oct. 20.",
      "\u201cWe are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump\u2019s unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,\u201d\u00a0Carney\u00a0said during a news briefing Sunday.",

      "Since becoming president, Trump has threatened sweeping tariffs against Canada, including on dairy and lumber. Trump\u2019s administration imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, rocking financial markets and eliciting $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs from Canada earlier this month. The European Union also issued retaliatory tariffs worth $28 billion on a wide range of U.S. goods, such as boats, motorbikes and alcohol.",
      "Trump has claimed that a primary reason for issuing tariffs against the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Canada, China and Mexico \u2014 is to curb fentanyl. But the fentanyl epidemic has been showing glimmers of improvement, and only about 10 pounds of the drug have been recovered at the Canadian border in the current fiscal year, according to Customs and Border Protection data.",
      "Trump has also suggested several times that Canada should become America\u2019s 51st state, saying it \"only works as a state.\"",
      "\"As a state, it would be one of the great states anywhere,\" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office this month. \"This would be the most incredible country, visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S. Just a straight, artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many many decades ago. Makes no sense. It\u2019s so perfect as a great and cherished state.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:10:33 GMT",
    "summary": "A catastrophic incident saw a single fire at a west London electrical substation bring Europe\u2019s busiest airport to a complete standstill on Friday, sparking speculation over Russian involvement, while others pointed to Britain's inadequate infrastructure in the search for answers.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 It was a spectacular thing to wake up to: Heathrow, one of the world\u2019s busiest airports, shut down and plunged into darkness. More than a thousand flights grounded, another hundred already in the air diverted to other cities or turned back to where they came from, in a crisis that snarled travel around the world.",
      "The shutdown was caused by a fire at an electrical substation 3 miles away that supplied much of the airport\u2019s critical services. British police have said there was no initial indication of foul play, and the London Fire Brigade has taken over the investigation from\u00a0counterintelligence officers, \u201cas the fire is now being treated as non-suspicious.\u201d",
      "But in the absence of information immediately after the fire, Britain\u2019s raucous tabloids were ablaze with speculation about Russian sabotage: \u201cIf Russia was behind Heathrow fire, is that an act of war?\u201d The Telegraph wondered in an op-ed headline. British radio presenter Nick Ferrari asked listeners jokingly whether anyone had seen Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "On social media, users pointed to patterns of sabotage by Russia, while others argued the fire was part of a broader strategy of hybrid warfare.",
      "It is not difficult to see why people might jump to such conclusions. The number of Russian sabotage attacks, many of them carried out in European NATO countries, nearly tripled between 2023 and 2024, after quadrupling between 2022 and 2023, according to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.",
      "Transportation and critical infrastructure, the CSIS report said, are some of its primary targets, and its main weapons and tactics have included explosives, blunt or edged instruments, and electronic attacks.",
      "Russia has denied accusations that it is orchestrating a sabotage campaign across Europe.",
      "In an article published by the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former adviser on defense and intelligence for Ukraine, said sabotage was getting a higher priority in Russia, with the European intelligence community reporting that a new unit, the 236th Specialist Training Center, had been created to \u201cseriously scale up sabotage operations.\u201d",
      "According to CSIS, roughly 27 % of the known attacks were against transportation targets, another 27% were against government targets, and 21% were against critical infrastructure, including the electricity grid, pipelines and undersea fiber-optic cables.",
      "On Friday, the Kremlin knew more accusations would be coming.",
      "Shortly after the scale of the Heathrow disruption unfolded, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council and a former president, addressed U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on X: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to Russia being blamed for the Heathrow fire. What are you waiting for, Starmer?\u201d",
      "A British official told NBC News on Friday there was \u201cno indication of Russian involvement.\u201d",
      "But H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate at RUSI, said he wasn\u2019t surprised that people jumped to conclusions about Russian sabotage at Heathrow.",
      "\u201cThe disinformation and misinformation environment that we\u2019re in leads a lot of people to assume that when bad stuff happens like this, there\u2019s going to be some sort of Russian fingerprint, because there have been so many Russian fingerprints in the past,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "The increase in attacks appeared to be tied to an increase in military assistance from European governments to Ukraine, according to the CSIS report, with many targets having links to Western aid to Ukraine, such as companies producing or shipping weapons and other supplies. The report also noted that there were no recorded incidents in countries that did not provide significant aid to Ukraine, like Serbia or Hungary.",
      "Richard Moore, head of MI6, has previously described Russia\u2019s actions as a \u201cstaggeringly reckless campaign\u201d intended to \u201csow fear about the consequences of aiding Ukraine\u201d and challenge Western resolve.",
      "The timing of the Heathrow fire, which followed weeks of increased British support for Ukraine as Starmer sought to step in as U.S. backing receded, added fuel to the speculation.",
      "However, Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at RUSI, said while the timing may appear suspicious, covert action \u201ctakes time to plan and prepare.\u201d",
      "\u201cImplementing a plan and executing it at a few days\u2019 notice is not easy,\u201d he said on X. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean its impossible of course!\u201d",
      "The Associated Press has documented at least 59 incidents in which Russia, its proxies or its ally Belarus were blamed by governments and officials for acts across Europe ranging from cyberattacks and propaganda campaigns to sabotage, espionage and assassinations, much of it aimed at entities supporting Ukraine.",
      "Last year, Western security officials said Russia was behind a plot to plant bombs on cargo planes in Germany and the U.K. as part of a wider sabotage campaign to start fires aboard aircraft bound for North America.",
      "According to NATO, Russia was behind a plot to kill the head of a German arms manufacturer supplying weapons to Ukraine, while European authorities are also investigating damage to undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, with Finnish officials detaining a ship suspected of being part of Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, a Russian dissident was poisoned in 2018 with the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, and earlier this month, three Bulgarians were found guilty of running a Russian spy ring from a British seaside resort.",
      "The ongoing sabotage by Russia has created an environment where Russia\u2019s adversaries feel uncomfortable and anxious and slightly paranoid.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in the movies,\u201d Hellyer said. \u201cI might be paranoid, but it doesn\u2019t mean that not everybody\u2019s out to get me.\u201d",
      "Savill warned that even if Russia had nothing to do with Heathrow, the mere perception of vulnerability has strategic consequences.",
      "\u201cIf you look vulnerable, you are less resilient,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cAnd that reduces the cost of action against you, limiting the deterrent effect you can achieve.\u201d",
      "The CSIS report suggested Russia\u2019s covert sabotage activities in Europe aimed to erode public support for Ukraine by creating fear and uncertainty.",
      "For now, however, public support for Ukraine remains high. A 2024 European Union survey indicated strong backing for the E.U.\u2019s response to the Russian invasion, with 89% supporting humanitarian aid, 84% in favor of welcoming refugees and 72% approving sanctions on Russia."
