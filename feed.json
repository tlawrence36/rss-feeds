      "The story of Jimmy Cliff, who has died at age 81, is in part the story of reggae itself",
      "NEW YORK -- The story of Jimmy Cliff, who has died at age 81, is in part the story of reggae itself.",
      "Like so many Jamaican teens of his time, he moved to Kingston in the early 1960s and joined a rising musical movement that would help give voice to the country's independence from Great Britain. A decade later, he helped reggae ascend to the international stage with his starring role in the cult favorite \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d and his featured place on the film's classic soundtrack. In the years following, his songs were covered by everyone from Bruce Springsteen to UB40 and confirmed the music's power to inspire or just get you dancing.",
      "Here are a few songs that trace the arc of his career, and of reggae.",
      "Singing along to an easy, bluesy groove, Cliff had a way of sounding both relaxed and fully committed, and could make a nursery rhyme sound like an anthem: \u201cRoses are red / violets are blue / Believe me / I love you.\u201d He also joined a long popular tradition, most famously expressed in such 1970s standards as Billy Joel's \u201cJust the Way You Are\u201d and Springsteen's \u201cThunder Road,\u201d of offering praise to a very personal kind of beauty: \u201cAlthough you may not have such a fabulous shape / To suit the rest of the world / But you do suit me and that\u2019s all I want to know.\u201d",
      "Like Marvin Gaye's \u201cWhat's Going On\u201d and other anti-war songs, Cliff's \u201cVietnam\u201d was drawn from the horrors of those who had served overseas. \u201cVietnam\u201d was a seething, mid-tempo chant \u2014 \u201cVi-et-nam, Vi-et-nam,\u201d the very name an indictment, in this song for the death of a soldier who had written home to say he would soon be returning, only for his mother to receive a telegram the next day announcing his death.",
      "One of Cliff's many talents was looking clear-eyed at life as it is, and imagining so well what it could be \u2014 a paradise made real by the melody, the feel and lyrics of \u201cWonderful World, Beautiful People,\u201d a vision so inevitable even the likes of President Richard Nixon and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson can't get in the way. \u201cThis is our world, can\u2019t you see? / Everybody wants to live and be free.\u201d",

      "Onstage, he sometimes literally jumped for joy, but Cliff also could call out the deepest notes of despair. The somber, gospel-style \u201cMany Rivers to Cross\u201d was inspired by the racism he encountered in England in the 1960s and tells a story of displacement, longing, fatigue and gathering rage \u2014 but never defeat. \u201cI merely survive because of my pride,\u201d he tells us, a variation of the old saying that hopes dies last.",
      "Cliff\u2019s political songs were so enduring in part because they were so catchy, and because they offered hope without the promise of easy success. Kicked off by a spare horn riff, \u201cYou Can Get It If You Really Want\u201d has a lighter mood than \u201cVietnam,\u201d but just as determined a spirit. \u201cYou must try, try and try, try and try,\u201d Cliff warns. \u201cPersecution you must fear / Win or lose you got to get your share.\u201d",
      "The title track to the movie which would mark the high point of his success, \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d has a spiky, muscular rhythm, the kind you could set to the forward march of a mass protest. It\u2019s a sermon of retribution for oppressors \u2014 \u201cthe harder they fall, one and all\u201d \u2014 and of earthly rewards for those who have been robbed: \u201cSo as sure as the sun will shine / I\u2019m gonna get my share now, what\u2019s mine.\u201d",

      "NEW DELHI -- Dharmendra, one of Indian cinema\u2019s most popular stars whose versatile performances made him a defining screen presence of 1970s and 1980s Bollywood films, died Monday. He was 89.",
      "The actor, who would have turned 90 on Dec. 8, had been in and out of a hospital in the financial capital, Mumbai, over the past few weeks.",
      "A senior police official who had spoken to Dharmendra's doctor confirmed the death on condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor's death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.",
      "\u201cHe was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,\u201d Modi said on social media platform X.",
      "Often called Bollywood\u2019s \u201cHe-Man,\u201d Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India\u2019s most iconic actors. Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero \u2014 upright, patriotic and fearless \u2014 his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.",
      "Dharmendra\u2019s performance in \u201cSholay\u201d (1975) \u2014 Bollywood\u2019s take on the Spaghetti Western and regarded as one of India\u2019s greatest films \u2014 earned him enduring popularity. His roles in other Hindi-language hits, from the romantic comedy \u201cChupke Chupke\u201d (1975) to the action drama \u201cMera Gaon Mera Desh\u201d (1971), made him one of the most recognizable film faces from that era.",
      "His role in Bollywood classic \u201cSholay,\u201d where he played an affable character alongside Amitabh Bachchan, his co-actor in the film, cemented his status as a superstar. The duo\u2019s on-screen partnership also became one of Bollywood\u2019s most iconic pairings.",
      "His on-screen chemistry with actress Hema Malini, whom he later married, became one of Bollywood\u2019s most popular collaborations, as the pair acted together in more than two dozen films. But their union was rooted in scandal. Dharmendra had married Prakash Kaur before his film debut, and went on to have four children with her, including two who would follow in his acting footsteps \u2014 Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol.",
      "Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her. According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.",

      "In 2012, Dharmendra was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India\u2019s third-highest civilian honor, in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema. He also briefly turned to politics, serving as a Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker in Parliament from 2004 to 2009, though his political stint was short-lived.",

Just a year after part one brought droves of audiences to movie theaters around the country, even more people bought opening weekend tickets to see the epic conclusion, \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d According to studio estimates on Sunday, \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d earned $150 million from North American theaters in its first days in theaters and $226 million globally.",
      "Not only is it the biggest opening ever for a Broadway musical adaptation, unseating the record set by the first film\u2019s $112 million launch, it\u2019s also the second biggest debut of the year behind \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u2019s\u201d $162 million.",
      "\u201cThe results are just fantastic,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads domestic distribution for Universal. \u201cSome films can deliver a false positive when tickets go on sale early but these results speak for themselves.\"",
      "Universal began rolling out \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d in theaters earlier this week, with previews on Monday ($6.1 million from 1,050 theaters) and Wednesday ($6.5 million from 2,300 theaters). By Friday it was playing in 4,115 North American locations and had raked in $68.6 million. IMAX showings accounted for $15.5 million, or 11%, of its domestic haul \u2014 a November record for the company.",
      "IMAX CEO Rich Gelfond said in a statement that the strong market share shows, \u201cour momentum carries into demos and genres beyond our traditional core, including families.\u201d",
      "As with the first film, women powered opening weekend, making up around 71% of ticket buyers according to PostTrak exit polls. Critics were somewhat mixed on the final chapter, but audiences weren\u2019t: An overwhelming 83% of audiences said it was one they would \u201cdefinitely recommend\u201d to friends. As far as foot traffic is concerned, the box office tracker EntTelligence estimates that about 2 million more people came out for \u201cWicked: For Good's\u201d first weekend than for \u201cWicked's.\"",
      "Jon M. Chu directed both \u201cWicked\u201d films, starring Cynthia Ervio and Ariana Grande. The first film made over $758.7 million worldwide and received 10 Oscar nominations (winning two, for costume and production design ). The question is how high \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d can soar. Combined, the two films cost around $300 million to produce, not including marketing and promotion costs.",
      "\u201cThe first film paved the way,\u201d Orr said. \u201cIt's really become a cultural event I think audiences are going to be flocking to theaters for quite some time to come.\u201d",

Searchlight Pictures opened its Brendan Fraser film \u201cRental Family\u201d in 1,925 theaters where it earned $3.3 million.

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Ornella Vanoni, a beloved performer who had a seven decade-long singing career with such international hits as \u201cSenza Fine\u201d and \"L\u2019appuntamento,\u201d has died. She was 91.",
      "In a post on X Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her deep sorrow for the loss of Vanoni, whose \u201cunmistakable voice\u201d left an imprint on Italian culture for generations. \u201cItaly loses a unique artist who leaves us with an unrepeatable artistic heritage,\u201d Meloni said.",
      "Vanoni died of cardiac arrest at her Milan home, Italian newspaper La Stampa reported.",
      "Vanoni recorded more than 100 albums with sales of over 55 million copies, vaulting her to iconic status among generations of fans and earning her the moniker \u201cThe Lady of Italian Song,\u201d according to LaPresse newspaper.",
      "Born in Milan in 1937, Vanoni's first love was the theater, which culminated with performances on the Broadway stage in 1964. But her passion for music combined with what LaPresse described as a \u201chighly personal and sophisticated performing style\u201d and vast repertoire from jazz to pop led her to collaborate with some of the most important songwriters in Italy and abroad.",
      "Vanoni's partnership \u2014 and love affair \u2014 with famed Genovese singer-songwriter Gino Paoli produced the hit \u201cSenza Fine\u201d (Without End), which shot her onto the international stage in 1961.",

      "Her talent extended into songwriting which was recognized when she twice won the prestigious Tenco Award \u2014 the only Italian singer to be awarded the prize as a songwriter and the only woman to have won it twice.",
      "ANSA said Vanoni was much sought-after as a guest on television programs in her later years because of her unpredictable nature, the vast wealth of anecdotes she shared and her \u201ccomplete indifference to political correctness.\"",

      "Rosal\u00eda has won over millions of music lovers for her fusions of flamenco and urban Latin beats",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- And Rosal\u00eda said, \u201cLet there be Lux.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, the global Spanish pop star loved by millions for fusing flamenco with Latin hip-hop and reggaeton, has amazed her fans with a radical shift.",
      "The singer and songwriter\u2019s new album, \u201cLux\u201d (\u201cLight\u201d in Latin), is unabashedly spiritual. Fifteen songs, sung in 13 different languages, including fragments in Latin, Arabic and Hebrew, are laden with a yearning for the divine.",
      "And it is receiving praise from on high.",
      "Xabier G\u00f3mez Garc\u00eda, bishop of Sant Feliu de Llobregat which includes Rosal\u00eda\u2019s hometown of Sant Esteve Sesrovires near Barcelona, was one of the first church leaders to laud her work in an open letter to his flock. Rosal\u00eda\u2019s grandmother regularly attends mass in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, according to the diocese.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, G\u00f3mez said that while some of her songs were \u201cprovocative,\u201d Rosal\u00eda \u201cspeaks with absolute freedom and without hang-ups about what she feels God to be, and the desire, the thirst (to know God).\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I listened to \u2018Lux\u2019 and Rosal\u00eda speaking about her the context of her album and the creative process, I found myself faced with a process and a work that transcended the musical. Here was a spiritual search through the testimonies of women of immense spiritual maturity,\u201d he said.",
      "From her opening lyrics sung over piano and mournful cello, \u201cWho could live between the two/ First love the world and later love God,\u201d Rosal\u00eda announces that this album is a rupture from its Grammy-winning predecessors. \u201cEl mal querer (\u00a8The Bad Loving\u201d in Spanish) and \u201c Motomami \" had established Rosal\u00eda as one of the leading artists in the Spanish music world with her experimental urban beats.",
      "Despite \u2014 or thanks to \u2014 its diversity of styles and song forms, ranging from classical strings, snippets of electronica with a cameo by Bj\u00f6rk, a boys' choir from a thousand-year-old monastery, an aria-like song in Italian, a Portuguese fado and, of course, modern flamenco and hip-hop beats, \u201cLux\u201d is off to a powerful start among listeners. It has four songs in Spotify\u2019s Top 50 global chart for this week, more than any artist, including Taylor Swift.",
      "Madonna has declared herself a fan of \"Lux,\" and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has lavishly called it the \u201calbum of the decade.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, 33, has said that after her success in more popular music forms, she let her long-held longing for the spiritual guide her in making \u201cLux.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the end, in an age that seems not to be the age of faith or certainty or truth, there is more need than ever for a faith, or a certainty, or a truth,\" she told reporters in Mexico City last month.",
      "She said that she was guided by the concept that \u201can artist doubts less of his vocation when he works in the service of God than when he works in the service of him or herself.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda apparently has not had a revelatory \u201ccome-to-Jesus\u201d moment common among evangelical believers in America. Like many Spaniards, she grew up in a once staunchly Catholic Spain that has quickly secularized in recent decades, especially among the younger generations, leaving churches mostly to elderly parishioners.",
      "Even her early music flirted with medieval religious poetry, including one video clip from 2017 when she set a poem by 16th-century Spanish poet Saint John of the Cross to music.",
      "While embracing Catholic symbols and expressing a fascination with female saints, Rosal\u00eda seems to eschew strictly organized practice and draws inspiration from other religions, as well. \u201cLux\u201d responds to that diversity of interest, at one point quoting a Sufi poetess.",

Contrast that now with her look on the \u201cLux\u201d album cover, where she is dressed in a solid white nun's veil with her arms apparently trapped inside a white top, her gaze averted.",
      "Despite the potentially controversial move of comparing God to an obsessed lover in the song \u201cDios es un stalker\" (\"God Is a Stalker\" in Spanish), Rosal\u00eda has won over the equivalent of the Vatican's culture minister.",
      "Cardinal Jos\u00e9 Tolentino de Mendon\u00e7a, prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Culture and Education, told Spanish news agency EFE this month that Rosal\u00eda has detected a wider dissatisfaction with the secular world.",
      "\u201cWhen a creator like Rosal\u00eda speaks of spirituality,\u201d he said, \u201cit means that she captures a profound need in contemporary culture to approach spirituality, to cultivate an inner life.\u201d",
      "Among the songs about faith, Rosal\u00eda found the time to deliver tunes like \u201cLa Perla\" (\"The Pearl\" in Spanish) that dishes out scorn for a former lover.",
      "That deft mix of both high and pop culture is part of the allure of \u201cLux,\u201d said Josep Oton, professor of religious history for the ISCREB theology school in Barcelona.",
      "\u201cShe has succeeded in making popular music with very deep cultural roots,\u201d Oton told the AP. \u201cAnyone can listen to it, and people with different backgrounds can take away different things. It is pop music, but it is profound.\u201d",
      "\u201cLux\u201d can be intimidating for listeners, both due to its elaborate orchestration and smattering of esoteric lyrics that Rosal\u00eda was inspired to write after reading medieval mystical poets and their accounts of undergoing a transformative union with God through deep prayer and meditation.",
      "In the exhilarating \u201cReliquia\u201d (\u201cRelic\u201d in Spanish), Rosal\u00eda compares herself to female saints, listing the parts of her body and life she has left in cities around the world as relics for others\u2019 keeping. Her \u201cMio Cristo Piange Diamanti,\u201d (\"My Christ Weeps Diamonds\" in Italian), brims with the extravagant Baroque image of the jewels dripping from the eyes of the Messiah.",
      "In \u201cDivinize,\u201d Rosal\u00eda sings of the \u201cdivina buidor\u201d (\u201cdivine emptiness\u201d in Catalan), a central concept of medieval mysticism which focused on how the soul must experience abandonment to open a space where God can enter.",
      "Victoria Cirlot, professor of humanities at Barcelona\u2019s Pompeu Fabra University and expert in medieval feminine mystical tradition, liked \u201cLux\u201d for its ability to introduce complex religious concepts to the general public, while noting it is \u201ca minimalist\u201d sample of the mystical tradition.",
      "Cirlot said the moving \u201cLa Yugular\u201d (\u201cThe Jugular\u201d in Spanish) is rich in mystical thought because the throat, the home of the voice and the breath, is associated in many religious traditions as the body\u2019s door to the divine.",
      "But, for Cirlot, it\u2019s the entire package that makes \u201cLux\u201d so impactful.",
      "\u201cRosal\u00eda is not just a great singer; she is a great actress, and her body language is full of these mystical gestures like contorting her face in an expression of ecstasy, of staring into nothing,\u201d Cirlot said. \u201cAnd then we have her amazing voice, which creates a sense of flight.\u201d",

      "\"Wicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a fresh take on the original musical's second act",
      "Are you ready for more \u201cWicked\"? \u201cWicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a bulked-up take on the music of the original \u201cWicked\u201d musical's second act, grounded in yet-again stellar vocals from Cynthia Erivo as a misunderstood but defiant Elphaba and Ariana Grande as a conflicted but changing Glinda. New songs and lyrics raise the stakes \u2014 even if the music itself is at times weighed down by the plot it helps move along, like the film it accompanies.",
      "The soundtrack opens with \u201cEvery Day More Wicked,\u201d a lengthened-version of a section of the original Act 2 opener \u201cThank Goodness\u201d with new verses about Elphaba's perceived wickedness and Glinda's presumed goodness set to bold orchestration that matches the first film's opening number, \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked.\" Drum beats and ensemble singers are the world builders here, twisting the melody into a march.",
      "The album's first solo goes to Michelle Yeoh's Madame Morrible, the sorceress at the center of a propaganda campaign against Elphaba \u2014 a choice that works for the plot, but which offsets the power of Erivo and Grande's forthcoming vocals. They are introduced later, through brief interpolations of the Act 1 showstoppers \u201cThe Wizard and I\" and \u201cPopular.\" All of that makes for a dynamic film opener \u2014 but is more fractured in audio form, sans the sumptuous visuals and character reveals that tie those musical references together on screen.",
      "Fortunately, \u201cThank Goodness / I Couldn't Be Happier\u201d quickly follows, bringing Grande center-stage \u2014 and providing a rare-here opportunity for her soprano head-voice to give way to a deeper belt (her passionate tone, like other Glindas before her, turns this almost nonsensical lyric, \"There are bridges you cross you didn\u2019t know you crossed until you've crossed them,\" into a revelation). That's not the last we hear from this capital \u201cG\u201d Good, Glinda. \u201cWonderful,\u201d usually a duet between Elphaba and the Wizard of Oz, is \u2018Galinda-fied,\u2019 with Grande adding welcome harmonies \u2014 and a brief \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d interlude \u2014 to Jeff Goldblum's Wizard romp.",
      "It was always going to be hard for this album to live up to the soundtrack of the first \u201cWicked,\u201d which ended with Erivo\u2019s take on the iconic \u201cDefying Gravity\" battle cry, and saw Grande own the over-the-top glitz of \u201cPopular.\" But that grandness is replicated in key moments: In Grande's operatic soprano, in Erivo and Jonathan Bailey's sensual \u201cAs Long As You're Mine,\" in which Bailey as Fiyero manages to keep up with Erivo's beckoning vocals, and in \u201cNo Good Deed,\" the album's sonic peak.",
      "At 44 minutes and 52 seconds, the soundtrack adds over 15 minutes of music to the runtime of the original Broadway cast recording's second act. That includes two brand new songs written for the film (making them eligible for Oscar consideration), one for Erivo\u2019s Elphaba and one for Grande\u2019s Glinda. In lengthening the shorter second act into a 2 hour and 17 minute long film, director Jon M. Chu stretches some of these songs across scenes, filling them out with dialogue, additional verses from composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and additional scoring from composer John Powell. All of that is a double-edged sword (broom? wand?), at times deflating the power of the tight original tracks, at others adding felt emotional stakes ripe for satisfying listening.",
      "For example: Some of the drama of Marissa Bode, Ethan Slater and Erivo's \u201cWicked Witch of the East,\u201d a song performed on Broadway that was also left off the original cast recording, is weakened by which pieces of the interspersed dialogue remain, and which don't, in the soundtrack version of the song. Like the Tin Man, it feels a bit piecemeal.",
      "But the new tracks are highlights, fleshing out the album. Erivo's \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d pulls on the iconic line said by Dorothy in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\" providing this Oz-inspired show its take on the theme, like another Oz-inspired show, \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d found before. (\"Home,\" that show's nod to the line, was sung by Erivo at this year's Oscars ceremony). The song is the most inherently political, a timely tale of borders, defiance and community. It starts with Erivo's voice almost isolated, strings swelling behind her, and ends with the first of her transcendent vocal runs, restored to a full open note (after being cut short by the Cowardly Lion on screen) in the album.",
      "That power is felt tenfold in Erivo's take on \u201cNo Good Deed.\" The film may belong to Glinda\u2019s emotional trajectory, but it is Erivo who steals the soundtrack's climax. Drums return as the agony heard in her voice intensifies, the strings crescendoing with her final call.",
      "Glinda's emotional journey may at first be more subtle, but Grande portrays it deftly. Airy and introspective, \u201cGirl in the Bubble\u201d serves as turning point, filling in gaps about Glinda's internal reckoning. Her voice is restrained but emotional, Schwartz's lyrics straightforward with a cheese that feels earned, and thus earnest. This is Glinda after all, not Grande.",
      "Both songs boost the emotional payoff of the character\u2019s finale duet, the fan-beloved tear-jerker \u201cFor Good.\" And it's no surprise, years into their own journey with the characters, that Erivo and Grande nail the chemistry of their character's friendship.",

      "Fish, whose 2019 production of Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s \u201cOklahoma!\u201d won the Tony Award for best musical revival, is using the transcript of a 1993 C-Span face-off between the two men as the text of the play, which included call-ins from across the country.",

      "Kramer and Fauci went from adversaries to friends as they confronted the AIDS crisis from different sides in the 1980s and '90s. Kramer, who wrote \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d and founded the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, demanded the government do more and faster for those with symptoms.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A 1940 self-portrait by famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo of her asleep in a bed could make history Thursday when it goes on sale by Sotheby\u2019s in New York.",
      "With an estimated price of $40 million to $60 million, \u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama)\u201d \u2013 in English, \u201cThe Dream (The Bed)\u201d \u2014 may surpass the top price for a work by any female artist when it goes under the hammer. That record currently stands at $44.4 million, paid at Sotheby\u2019s in 2014 for Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s \u201cJimson Weed/White Flower No. 1.\u201d",
      "The highest price at auction for a Kahlo work is $34.9 million, paid in 2021 for \u201cDiego and I,\u201d depicting the artist and her husband, muralist Diego Rivera. Her paintings are reported to have sold privately for even more.",
      "The painting up for auction depicts Kahlo asleep in a wooden colonial-style bed, wrapped in a golden blanket embroidered with crawling vines and leaves. Above her, seemingly levitating atop the bedposts, lies a full-sized skeleton.",
      "In its catalog note, Sotheby's said the painting \u201coffers a spectral meditation on the porous boundary between sleep and death.\u201d",

      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",
      "\u201cThe suspended skeleton is often interpreted as a visualization of her anxiety about dying in her sleep, a fear all too plausible for an artist whose daily existence was shaped by chronic pain and past trauma,\u201d the catalog notes.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- On the frozen edge of the world, staying in practice as a professional musician takes ingenuity, grit and a plastic instrument for schoolchildren that\u2019s guaranteed not to freeze to your fingers or face.",
      "Natalie Paine is a French horn player in New Zealand\u2019s navy who since October has been among 21 military members stationed in Antarctica. There, her melodies drift across the frozen Ross Sea from perhaps the most remote practice room on Earth.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and very inspiring,\u201d Paine told the Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ll sit there by the window and I will do my routine and play music in my time off, which is not very often.\u201d",
      "The story of how she arrived in Antarctica is an unlikely one. Paine grew up in the hot, dry climate of Adelaide, Australia, where she dreamed of visiting the frozen continent as a scientist.",
      "She studied music at university instead, putting Antarctica out of her mind. Years later however, as a musician in New Zealand\u2019s navy, Paine learned members of the country\u2019s military were stationed in Antarctica to support the work of scientists.",
      "When she asked, her instructor said any military member could win one of the coveted assignments.",
      "\u201cMy eyes lit up and I was like, what? Even a musician?\u201d Paine said. \u201cHe\u2019s like, heck yeah, why not?\u201d",
      "Her dream was revived but enacting it wasn\u2019t simple. It took four years of unsuccessful applications before Paine landed a posting as a communications operator.",
      "It\u2019s a consuming job, worked in six-day stretches that leave little time for music. Paine monitors radio, phone, email and other communications traffic at New Zealand\u2019s mission at Scott Base, sometimes speaking to people on the ice who haven\u2019t heard other voices for weeks.",
      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",
      "While she plays by the window, watching seals on the ice, Paine finds new musical motifs bubbling up.",

      "Experts have mixed reactions to the recent U.N. climate talks in the Amazon",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- After an agreement from U.N. climate talks in the Amazon that fell short of many nations' expectations, experts found some bright spots alongside weighty reasons for worry in the fight against global warming.",
      "The Associated Press asked 17 experts \u2014 diplomats, analysts, advocates and scientists \u2014 the simple question: After the talks, known as COP30, in the city of Belem, what's next?",
      "\u201cWe leave here with a clear signal, very very clear signal, that we have entered the era of implementation,\" said U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell. \"As we move forward, it\u2019s about doing. It's about rolling sleeves up.\u201d",
      "Others look at the key failure of not delivering a road map to phase out coal, oil and gas \u2014 the main causes of warming. The road map had the public support of Brazil's president and more than 80 nations, but powerful opponents.",
      "\u201cThis should have been the moment. A COP in the Amazon, a president calling for a fossil fuel transition road map, the science screaming for action. But the world blinked again,'' Panama climate negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey G\u00f3mez said. \u201dThe next year will be harder on communities and ecosystems. Impacts will intensify, because emissions are not slowing down.\"",
      "Stiell pointed to seven different paragraphs in the agreements from Belem that could spur action for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and fewer fossil fuels. The COP presidency highlighted 117 \u201caction agenda\u201d items mostly for business to put pledges into real-life action.",
      "That agenda includes a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation. Among the most ambitious actions is a push to raise $1 trillion for renewable electrical grids and energy storage.",
      "One specific action that Stiell and several others emphasized was a new \u201cglobal implementation accelerator,\" a voluntary and cooperative system designed to help nations that want to do more than they've previously proposed in their climate fighting plans. The emphasis is on getting money to where it's needed.",
      "\u201cIf the \u2018ambition accelerator\u2019 can help to do this, it will make a massive difference to the global warming outlook,\u201d said Bill Hare, CEO of the climate science and policy institute Climate Analytics.",
      "Because they couldn't get a consensus at the talks in Belem, the COP30 presidency promised to create two new \u201croad maps,\" one to guide the transition away from fossil fuels and another to stop deforestation. But those road maps won't have the force of something agreed upon in UN talks.",
      "COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago said his office will study both areas extensively and use science and economics to come up with those plans. He said they would be tailored to different countries' needs.",
      "Do Lago also promised that his office will join with Colombia and the Netherlands to organize a special fossil fuel phaseout conference scheduled next April.",
      "\u201cIf they come with real timelines, accountability and finance, they have the potential to shape global action and hold governments to their word,\u201d said Mariana Paoli of the anti-poverty group Christian Aid. \u201cThey don\u2019t have power on their own, but they can create the structure around which real change is built.\u201d",

      "\u201cOver the next year, we are likely to see continued escalation of climate impacts alongside gradual progress on climate action,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, director of PowerShift Africa. \u201cRenewable energy expansion will continue, but so will new fossil fuel investments in many parts of the world.\u201d",

      "This week, the nation's top public health agency changed its website to contradict the scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. The move shocked health experts nationwide.",
      "Dr. Daniel Jernigan, who resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August, told reporters Wednesday that Kennedy seems to be \u201cgoing from evidence-based decision making to decision-based evidence making.\u201d",
      "It was the latest example of the Trump administration's challenge to established science.",
      "In September, the Republican president gave out medical advice based on weak or no evidence. Speaking directly to pregnant women and to parents, he told them not to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. He repeatedly made the fraudulent and long-disproven link between autism and vaccines, saying his assessment was based on a hunch.",
      "\u201cI have always had very strong feelings about autism and how it happened and where it came from,\u201d he said.",
      "At a two-day meeting this fall, Kennedy\u2019s handpicked vaccine advisers to the CDC raised questions about vaccinating babies against hepatitis B, an inoculation long shown to reduce disease and death drastically.",
      "\u201cThe discussion that has been brought up regarding safety is not based on evidence other than case reports and anecdotes,\u201d said Dr. Flor Munoz, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "During the country's worst year for measles in more than three decades, Kennedy cast doubt on the measles vaccine while championing unproven treatments and alleging that the unvaccinated children who died were \u201calready sick.\u201d",
      "Scientists say the process of getting medicines and vaccines to market and recommended in the United States has, until now, typically relied on gold standard science. The process is so rigorous and transparent that much of the rest of the world follows the lead of American regulators, giving the OK to treatments only after U.S. approval.",
      "The gold standard can differ because science and medicine is complicated and everything cannot be tested the same way. That term simply refers to the best possible evidence that can be gathered.",
      "\u201cIt completely depends on what question you\u2019re trying to answer,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and Stanford University researcher.",
      "There are many different types of studies. The most rigorous is the randomized clinical trial.",
      "It randomly creates two groups of subjects that are identical in every way except for the drug, treatment or other question being tested. Many are \u201cblinded studies,\u201d meaning neither the subjects nor the researchers know who is in which group. This helps eliminate bias.",
      "It is not always possible or ethical to conduct these tests. This is sometimes the case with vaccine trials, \u201cbecause we have so much data showing how safe and effective they are, it would be unethical to withhold vaccines from a particular group,\u201d said Jessica Steier, a public health scientist and founder of the Unbiased Science podcast.",
      "Studying the long-term effect of a behavior can be impossible. For example, scientists could not possibly study the long-term benefit of exercise by having one group not exercise for years.",
      "Instead, researchers must conduct observational studies, where they follow participants and track their health and behavior without manipulating any variables. Such studies helped scientists discover that fluoride reduces cavities, and later lab studies showed how fluoride strengthens tooth enamel.",
      "But the studies have limitations because they can often only prove correlation, not causation. For example, some observational studies have raised the possibility of a link between autism risk and using acetaminophen during pregnancy, but more have not found a connection. The big problem is that those kinds of studies cannot determine if the painkiller really made any difference or if it was the fever or other health problem that prompted the need for the pill.",
      "Scientists can learn even more when they see how something affects a large number of people in their daily lives.",
      "That real-world evidence can be valuable to prove how well something works \u2014 and when there are rare side effects that could never be detected in trials.",
      "Such evidence on vaccines has proved useful in both ways. Scientists now know there can be rare side effects with some vaccines and can alert doctors to be on the lookout. The data has proved that vaccines provide extraordinary protection from disease. For example, measles was eliminated in the U.S. but it still pops up among unvaccinated groups.",

      "What is \u201cwe mode,\u201d and how can you tap into it to improve your life",
      "With a runway of smoking-hot coals laid out before them, residents in San Pedro Manrique, Spain, steel themselves as thousands of onlookers cheer them on. The crowd roars when they walk across the fire, sometimes carrying another person on their back.",
      "Although the walkers and the crowd perform very different roles during the annual June ritual, they report similar feelings: an ineffable feeling of togetherness, as if the entire group becomes one, said Dimitris Xygalatas, a cognitive anthropologist at the University of Connecticut, who witnessed the Spanish ritual years ago as a researcher.",
      "He has experienced similar feelings in a stadium while chanting and cheering together with 30,000 fans of his hometown soccer team. Both are instances of collective effervescence, said Xygalatas, author of \u201cRituals: How Seemingly Senseless Acts Make Life Worth Living.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that feeling that happens when people engage together in a meaningful activity that sparks positive emotions. Such as when you get goose bumps at a concert, feel the rush of adrenaline in group exercise classes or get swept up in religious festivals.",
      "Recently, collective effervescence has been referred to as \u201cwe mode,\u201d and it\u2019s something that can be cultivated to improve your life, said Kelly McGonigal, a Stanford University health psychologist.",
      "\u201cWhen you are connected through shared positive emotion, expressions often act as this aerosolized joy, where you catch other people\u2019s smiles, laughter, their physical expressions,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cIt becomes contagious.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe mode\u201d has also been called physiological synchrony, and McGonigal calls it \u201ccollective joy.\u201d The concept was documented more than a century ago by French sociologist Emile Durkheim, who described cultural effervescence after studying aboriginal Australian societies.",
      "Xygalatas\u2019 research has focused on measuring it in various group activities. To quantify \u201cautonomic responses,\u201d he has fitted people with heart monitors and electrodes and extracted thousands of stills from videos to analyze facial expressions.",
      "He found that people\u2019s physiological responses synchronize during exciting events. The heartbeats of sports fans who attend a game, for instance, sync up, while those of fans watching the same game on TV don\u2019t. Fans at the game also have higher levels of endorphins, which have been linked to bonding, he said.",
      "On a basic level, collective rituals involve meeting and connecting with people, which is a key to psychological well-being, Xygalatas noted.",
      "\u201cIf we all dress alike and we move alike and we feel alike, we express the same emotions that trigger mechanisms in our brain,\u201d Xygalatas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental need for synchrony.\u201d",

      "The U.S. flu season is starting slowly, and it\u2019s not clear if it will be as bad as last winter\u2019s",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. flu season is starting slowly, and it's unclear if it will be as bad as last winter's, but some health experts are worried as U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data posted Friday shows a new version of the virus has emerged.",
      "An early analysis suggests current vaccines may still be somewhat effective against the new version of the flu, which has been the main driver of recent infections, CDC data shows.",
      "Some scientists and medical professionals are more worried about disappointing vaccination rates, a main reason why flu hospitalizations and deaths were unusually bad during last year's flu season \u2014 one of the deadliest this century.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a really severe season,\" said Asefeh Faraz Covelli of the George Washington University School of Nursing.",
      "Last winter, the overall flu hospitalization rate was the highest seen since the H1N1 flu pandemic 15 years ago. Flu was the underlying or a contributing cause of more than 18,000 deaths, and one seven-day stretch early this year saw more than 1,800 deaths \u2014 the highest one-week spike in at least a decade. Child flu deaths also were far higher than usual.",
      "CDC data posted Friday showed low flu activity so far, with only one state \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 reporting moderate activity. Most of the reported infections have been in children, said the CDC's Alicia Budd, who tracks flu infections for the Atlanta-based agency.",
      "Most also have been a new version of the type A H3N2 virus that historically has caused the most hospitalizations and deaths in older people. That type is responsible for most flu infections so far this year, and more than half have been a new subclade K variant that is different from the strain this year's flu shots were built to fight.",
      "A preliminary analysis from the United Kingdom suggests the shots do provide at least partial protection, although it will take some time for scientists to know exactly how effective they are. Experts say any protection that softens the blow of a flu infection is important to get.",
      "Flu seasons tend to get bad between December and February, and illnesses likely will accelerate as people travel and gather for Thanksgiving, Covelli said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to start picking up here,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the ideal time to get vaccinated.\u201d",
      "Researchers this year have been facing an unusual struggle to get a handle on how respiratory infection and vaccination rates have been trending.",

Kennedy Jr. was put in charge of the CDC and other federal health agencies. Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist, has fostered uncertainty about the safety of vaccines, including flu shots that contained a preservative called thimerosal.",
      "Indeed, vaccination rates against COVID-19 clearly continue to plummet, with about 6% of children and 14% of adults up to date on their shots, according to other CDC data posted Friday. Each figure is about 3 percentage points less than it was at this point last fall.",
      "For the flu, vaccination trends are a little muddier. Some sources have suggested flu vaccinations are down. Over two million fewer flu shots were given at U.S. pharmacies through the end of October compared to last year, according to data from IQVIA, a health information and research company.",
      "But the latest CDC data indicates that for children, the vaccination rate this year is about the same as it was at this point last fall, at 34%. And the vaccination rate for adults is up a few percentage points to about 37%, according to the CDC data, which relies on survey information.",
      "It is early in the season and too early to know if the increase will be sustained or what is causing it, CDC officials said.",
      "As of the beginning of November, the U.S. flu hospitalization rate is about the same as it was at the same point in 2024. Hospitalization rates for COVID-19 and another respiratory virus, RSV, are lower so far this season, according to another set of CDC data.",

      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The World Health Organization has declared Indonesia\u2019s polio outbreak officially over, following nearly three years of intensive response efforts, officials said Friday.",
      "Indonesia has remained largely polio-free as the highly contagious disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2014. But eight years later, an outbreak emerged in the country's conservative Aceh province, prompted by a dangerous combination of consistently low routine immunization and unhealthy environmental conditions. In 2021, only 50.9% of infants born in Aceh received polio vaccination.",
      "Officials say that polio immunization rates in Aceh are well behind the rest of the country, with efforts hampered by widespread disinformation that the vaccine is incompatible with religious beliefs, among other things. The government has also been prioritizing COVID-19 vaccinations since they became available.",
      "Over the next two years, cases appeared in the provinces of Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, North Maluku, Central Papua, Highland Papua and South Papua, prompting the mass immunization and information drive. Nearly 60 million additional doses of polio vaccine were administered to children during the response.",
      "The last confirmed polio case was in South Papua province on June 2024. Since then, no poliovirus has been detected in children or in the environment, prompting WHO to declare the outbreak over on Wednesday.",
      "In a joint announcement on Friday, Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin credited the success to \u201cthe dedication of health workers and the commitment of parents and communities,\" while WHO's Western Pacific Regional Director Saia Ma'u Piukala called the achievement \u201ca critical step toward global eradication,\u201d while calling for continued vigilance.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is fending off criticism from his own base as some of the environmental and anti-vaccine activists who propelled him into politics have said they want stronger action against vaccines and pharmaceutical companies",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent a recent Wednesday showered in praise from the vice president and health technology CEOs at a glitzy \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d event in Washington, designed to celebrate the health secretary\u2019s successes and the movement he has built.",
      "Yet online, a different narrative of his tenure was playing out as a small but vocal group of Kennedy\u2019s supporters and former employees assailed top Trump administration advisers, claiming they were sabotaging him and redirecting MAHA away from its original goals.",
      "\u201cMAHA is not MAHA anymore,\u201d Gray Delany, a former Department of Health and Human Services official ousted in August, said in a podcast interview that day. \u201cI\u2019m not there, but what I\u2019ve heard of what\u2019s happening today is not the MAHA that we signed up for.\u201d",
      "The criticisms, which grew loud enough that the health secretary took to social media to defend his colleagues two days later, exposed the cracks that are beginning to form within his coalition as it amasses power and broadens in scope.",
      "Several of the environmental advocates and vaccine skeptics who helped propel Kennedy into politics have become impatient with what they view as inadequate action on their priorities. They\u2019re also wary that the Health Department appears willing to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies, tech firms and other big corporations whose motives they don\u2019t trust.",
      "The fissures pose a threat to the cohesion of a movement that has given President Donald Trump an important ally and Republicans access to a new group of voters. They come as cracks have developed in Trump's own Make America Great Again movement over issues like the Epstein files and the White House's focus on global diplomacy.",
      "In the wider public, MAHA has enjoyed soaring popularity. About two-thirds of Americans said they supported the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative from the federal government, according to an Ipsos poll from June.",
      "\u201cMAHA\u2019s growth is a sign of its success,\u201d said HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon. \u201cSecretary Kennedy is leading a broad coalition to make Americans healthier, guided by transparency, accountability and measurable results. The movement\u2019s meaning hasn\u2019t changed and it\u2019s stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "Public health researchers say the genius that fuels Kennedy\u2019s movement \u2014 the universal appeal of making Americans healthier \u2014 can also cause conflicts by inviting competing interests.",
      "\u201cThis is a tale as old as time in politics,\u201d said Matt Motta, a professor at Boston University School of Public Health. \u201cThe bigger your tent is, the harder it can be to make everyone happy.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, a longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist who helped lead the crusade against COVID-19 shots during the pandemic, has taken many steps to curtail vaccines this year. He pulled $500 million for their development, ousted and replaced every member of a federal vaccine advisory committee and pledged to overhaul a federal program for compensating Americans injured by shots. He also has repeatedly spread false and misleading information about vaccines while in office.",
      "As recently as this week, in a move that thrilled Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its website to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "But many of Kennedy's supporters in what they call the \u201chealth freedom\u201d movement say it\u2019s not enough. Some want punishments for companies that profited from vaccine and mask requirements during the pandemic. Others want mRNA-based COVID-19 shots pulled from the shelves, despite scientific consensus that they have saved millions of lives.",
      "In their attacks on the administration last week, a few MAHA influencers and two fired HHS employees suggested White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Kennedy\u2019s close adviser, Stefanie Spear, were conspiring to limit Kennedy\u2019s ability to restrict vaccines and crack down on pharmaceutical companies.",
      "Some Kennedy supporters latched on to the claims and pointed to Wiles\u2019 career history at a lobbying firm that has worked with Pfizer as evidence she\u2019s trying to undermine him. They also shared years-old social media posts from Spear criticizing Trump.",
      "Kennedy defended his colleagues in two posts on X, saying the MAHA movement has \u201cno better friend in Washington\u201d than Wiles and that Spear has become a Trump loyalist.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s focus on our extraordinary achievements to date and the monumental work that still needs to be done,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s build our coalition instead of splintering it.\u201d",
      "Since the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d slogan debuted on the campaign trail last year, Kennedy and Trump have widened the MAHA tent considerably by inviting anyone into the fold who has concerns about Americans\u2019 health, nutrition and chronic disease.",

      "Several of Kennedy\u2019s core supporters said they see the government as a deeply entrenched bureaucracy that won\u2019t be easy to reform, even as they hope he'll be able to remove toxins from food and the environment and further restrict vaccines. Kennedy, at an appearance with western governors Thursday, said he doesn't intend to take away people's access to vaccines.",

      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides monthly benefits \u2014 averaging around $190 per person \u2014 to about 42 million people nationwide. During the first couple weeks of November, many of those recipients missed their regular allotments as President Donald Trump's administration battled in court over whether tap into reserves to fund the program while the government was shut down.",

      "The work requirements previously applied to adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents.

It repeals work exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and young adults aging out of foster care. And it limits the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas lacking jobs.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A 33-year-old South Korean man was sentenced to life in prison Monday for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused 261 victims, including more than a dozen minors he raped or assaulted, over a four-year period before his arrest in January.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said the severity of Kim Nok-wan\u2019s crimes warrants his \u201cpermanent isolation from society.\u201d It sentenced 10 accomplices to prison terms ranging from two to four years in what law enforcement authorities describe as the country\u2019s largest cybersex crime case to date.",
      "Starting around August 2020, Kim targeted women who posted sexually suggestive content on social media, and men attempting to join secret Telegram chat rooms for sharing digitally-manipulated sexual images of acquaintances. He threatened to expose them and coerced them into recruiting new victims, forming a pyramid-like blackmail ring on the app that produced and shared manipulated sexual images of their targets, most of whom were minors, according to details of the crimes revealed in court.",
      "Kim raped or assaulted 16 victims, including 14 minors, and recorded videos of his crimes in 13 of those cases. He created roughly 1,700 sexually exploitative images or videos targeting about 70 victims, disseminating around 260 of them online to threaten those who refused to cooperate, and also attempted to blackmail some of the victims\u2019 family members and work colleagues, the court said.",
      "The other defendants, including five minors, knew that the victims they recruited through threats involving video and images would face the same sexual exploitation they had endured, but carried out the acts anyway to prevent their own images from being circulated, the court said.",
      "\u201cMost of the victims were children or adolescents, and it appears they would have suffered extreme physical and psychological pain as a result of the crimes,\u201d the court said in a statement.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is set to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by designating the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- President Donald Trump's administration is set to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Monday by designating the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. But the entity that the U.S. government alleges is led by Maduro is not a cartel per se.",
      "The designation is the latest measure in the Trump administration's escalating campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. In previewing the step about a week ago, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, of being \u201cresponsible for terrorist violence\u201d in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "The move planned Monday comes as Trump evaluates whether to take military action against Venezuela, which Trump has not ruled out despite bringing up the possibility of talks with Maduro. Land strikes or other actions would be a major expansion of the monthslong operation that has included a massive military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and striking boats accused of trafficking drugs, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Venezuelans began using the term Cartel de los Soles in the 1990s to refer to high-ranking military officers who had grown rich from drug-running. As corruption later expanded nationwide, first under the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and then under Maduro, its use loosely expanded to police and government officials as well as activities like illegal mining and fuel trafficking. The \u201csuns\u201d in the name refer to the epaulettes affixed to the uniforms of high-ranking military officers.",
      "The umbrella term was elevated to a Maduro-led drug-trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department in Trump's first term announced the indictment of Venezuela\u2019s leader and his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges.",
      "\u201cIt is not a group,\u201d said Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America organization. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don\u2019t have regular meetings. They don\u2019t have a hierarchy.\u201d",
      "Up until this year, the label of foreign terrorist organization had been reserved for groups like the Islamic State or al-Qaida that use violence for political ends. The Trump administration applied it in February to eight Latin American criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and other activities.",
      "The administration blames such designated groups for operating the boats it is striking but rarely identifies the organizations and has not provided any evidence. It says the attacks , which began off the coast of Venezuela and later expanded to the eastern Pacific Ocean, are meant to stop narcotics from flowing to American cities.",
      "But many \u2014 including Maduro himself \u2014 see the military moves as an effort to end the ruling party's 26-year hold on power.",
      "Since the arrival of U.S. military vessels and troops to the Caribbean months ago, Venezuela\u2019s U.S.-backed political opposition also has reignited its perennial promise of removing Maduro from office, fueling speculation over the purpose of what the Trump administration has called a counterdrug operation.",
      "Trump, like his predecessor, does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's president.",
      "Maduro is on his third term in office after ruling-party loyalists declared him the winner of last year's presidential election despite credible evidence that the opposition's candidate defeated him by a more than 2-to-1 margin. He and senior officials have been repeatedly accused of human rights violations of real and perceived government opponents, including in the aftermath of the July 2024 election.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government in a statement Monday categorically denied the existence of the cartel, describing the Trump administration\u2019s accusation as a \u201cridiculous fabrication\u201d meant to \u201cjustify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela.\u201d",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that the upcoming designation of Cartel de los Soles will provide a \u201cwhole bunch of new options to the United States\u201d for dealing with Maduro. But Hegseth, speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, did not provide details on what those options are and declined to say whether the U.S. military planned to strike land targets inside Venezuela.",

      "The official added that Trump has been keenly listening to his intelligence team, which has reported to him that chatter picked up inside Venezuela indicates growing anxiety from Maduro and other high-level Venezuelan officials as the U.S. strikes continue. Trump, the official said, is \u201cvery content and satisfied\u201d for the moment with the strikes' impact.",
      "All the while, pleas from Maduro and others close to the Venezuelan leader to speak directly to the administration, relayed through various intermediaries and channels, seem to be more frantic, the official said. But Trump has not sanctioned any intermediaries to speak to Maduro on behalf of the U.S. administration.",
      "The 2020 indictment accused Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, among others, of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the Venezuelan military for several years \u201cto flood the United States with cocaine\u201d and use the drug trade as a \u201cweapon against America.\u201d Colombia is the world's top cocaine producer.",

Dissidents continued the work. Colombia's National Liberation Army guerrilla is also involved in the illegal trade.",
      "Maduro has denied the charges. The U.S. Justice Department this year doubled to $50 million the reward for information that leads to Maduro\u2019s arrest.",
      "Maduro has insisted that the U.S. is building a false drug-trafficking narrative to try to force him from office.

      "U.S. authorities also alleged Maduro\u2019s cartel gave material support to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa cartel, both of which were among the organizations that the U.S. designated as foreign terror organizations in February.",

      "Massive corruption has been blamed for substandard or non-existent flood control projects in the poverty-stricken Southeast Asian country long prone to deadly floods and extreme weather. Two Philippine presidents, including Marcos\u2019 late father, were overthrown in peaceful public revolts due to alleged plunder and misrule.",

      "The first corruption case involved irregularities in flood control projects in Oriental Mindoro province, including a river dike worth 289 million pesos ($4.8 million), that were undertaken by Sunwest Corp., a construction firm that officials say is owned by Co\u2019s family.",
      "Marcos said one suspect was arrested and six others surrendered over the weekend to police. The arrested suspect was found in a house in suburban Quezon city in the capital region where an unspecified number of people who were trying to help hide the suspect were also arrested, he said.",
      "\u201cMy advice to the remaining suspects is for all of you to surrender, don\u2019t wait to be pursued,\u201d Marcos said in an early Monday post on his Facebook account. \u201cThis will continue, we will not stop.\u201d",

      "HEYBELIADA, Turkey -- As Pope Leo XIV prepares to embark on his first trip abroad with a visit to Turkey to mark a key event that shaped the foundations of Catholic and Orthodox Christianity, there has been a surge of renewed optimism over the possible reopening of a Greek Orthodox religious seminary that has been closed since 1971.",
      "The Halki Theological School has become a symbol of Orthodox heritage and a focal point in the push for religious freedoms in Turkey.",
      "Located on Heybeliada Island, off the coast of Istanbul, the seminary once trained generations of Greek Orthodox patriarchs and clergy. They include Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide.",
      "Turkey closed the school under laws restricting private higher education, and despite repeated appeals from international religious leaders and human rights advocates \u2014 as well as subsequent legal changes that allowed private universities to flourish \u2014 it has remained shut ever since.",
      "Momentum for reopening it appeared to grow after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the issue with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in September. Erdogan said Turkey would \u201cdo our part\u201d regarding its reopening. Erdogan had previously linked the move to reciprocal measures from Greece to improve the rights of Muslims there.",
      "The school, which was founded in 1844, stands surrounded by scaffolding as renovation work continues. Inside, one floor that serves as the clergy quarters and two classrooms have already been completed, standing ready to welcome students once the seminary reopens.",
      "During his visit to Turkey, starting on Thursday, Leo is scheduled to meet Erdogan and join Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in commemorating the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, in a pilgrimage honoring Christianity\u2019s theological roots. He will then travel to Lebanon for the second leg of his trip.",
      "Turkey is now \u201cready to make the big step forward for the benefit of Turkey, for the benefit of the minorities and for the benefit of religious and minority rights in this country\u201d by reopening the seminary, Archbishop Elpidophoros, head of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, told The Associated Press in a video interview from his base in New York.",
      "A committee of representatives from the Istanbul-based Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the Turkish government has begun discussions on the reopening, Elpidophoros said, expressing optimism that the school could welcome students again by the start of the next academic year.",
      "\u201cKeeping this school closed after more than 50 years is a political and diplomatic anachronism that doesn\u2019t help our country,\u201d said the Istanbul-born archbishop. \u201cWe have so many private universities and private schools in Turkey, so keeping only Halki closed doesn\u2019t help Turkey, doesn\u2019t help anyone.\u201d",
      "The fate of the seminary has long been viewed as a test of predominantly Muslim Turkey\u2019s treatment of religious minorities, including the country\u2019s Christian population, estimated at 200,000 to 370,000 out of nearly 86 million.",
      "Since coming to power in 2002, Erdogan\u2019s government has enacted reforms to improve the rights of religious groups, including opening places of worship and returning some property that was confiscated \u2014 but problems linger.",
      "Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, only Armenians, Greeks and Jews \u2014 non-Muslim minorities who were recognized under a 1923 peace treaty that established modern Turkey's borders \u2014 are allowed to operate places of worship and schools. Other Christian groups lack formal recognition and often face obstacles in registering churches or religious associations.",

      "The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, based in Istanbul, is internationally recognized as the \u201cfirst among equals\u201d in the Orthodox Christian world. Turkey however, does not recognize its ecumenical status, insisting that under the 1923 treaty, the patriarch is only head of the country\u2019s ever-dwindling Greek Orthodox minority.

      "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has broken the glass ceiling to become Japan's first female leader",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Sanae Takaichi made history by becoming Japan's first female prime minister in October. She must now decide whether she'll break another barrier: the taboo barring women from the sumo ring.",
      "The winner of the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament that ends Sunday will be presented with the Prime Minister\u2019s Cup. Some of her male predecessors, including former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, have entered the ring to hand over the cup.",
      "Takaichi, a staunch conservative who supports Japan\u2019s traditional gender and paternalistic values, may not break the taboo. In any case, she won't face a decision on whether to enter the sumo ring this time because she returns a day later from the Group of 20 summit in South Africa.",
      "Her next chance to make a decision will come at the New Year's tournament in Tokyo.",
      "But a debate on the taboo against women likely will continue, in no small part, because a woman now leads Japan. There also is criticism that the ban in sumo and other religious places is out of touch with the changing place of women in Japanese society.",
      "The sumo ring is only part of the controversy.",
      "In Japan, female worshippers have for centuries been banned from certain holy mountains, religious training sessions, temples, shrines and festivals.",
      "Other places in the world have similar taboos, but the one in Japan stems from the belief in female \u201cimpurity\u201d associated with menstruation and childbirth, as well as certain misogynic Buddhist views, says Naoko Kobayashi, an Aichi Gakuin University professor and expert on religion and gender.",
      "The female ban at holy mountains, including Mount Fuji, and religious establishments has been largely eliminated over the years. But it lingers at certain shrines and festivals.",
      "Many of these bans are from the 19th century Meiji era or later, Kobayashi said, and the taboo has been hard to break because women were also kept from political and religious decision-making over the years.",
      "Sumo's origins are linked to rituals for Japan\u2019s indigenous religion of Shinto, which is largely rooted in animism and the belief that thousands of kami, or spirits, inhabit nature. The first sumo matches date back 1,500 years as a ritual dedicated to the kami, with prayers for bountiful harvests, dancing and other performances at shrines.",
      "The dohyo where sumo takes place is an elevated ring made of special clay, with its edge marked by a circle of rice-straw separating the inner sanctuary and the outside world of impurity. It's off-limits to women in professional sumo.",
      "Some experts say sumo follows the Shinto belief in female impurity.",
      "The Japan Sumo Association has denied the female ban is based on the Shinto belief of impurity.",
      "\u201cThis interpretation is a misunderstanding,\u201d said the association chief, Nobuyoshi Hakkaku, in 2018. He said sumo rituals are tied to folk beliefs like being thankful for a good harvest and are not about rigid religious principles.",
      "\u201cWe have consistently denied sexist intentions,\u201d Hakkaku said. \u201cThe rule that makes the dohyo a serious battleground for men is only natural for wrestlers, making the dohyo a male-only world and (leading to) passing down the practice of not having women go up there.\u201d",

      "In 2018, the mayor of Maizuru in northern Kyoto collapsed during a speech in a sumo ring. Two female medical experts rushed in and started performing first aid as several male sumo officials watched. Two more women tried to join the first-aid effort before announcements demanded the women leave the ring. Sumo officials threw salt afterwards, a gesture of purification.",
      "Days later, the association refused to allow Tomoko Nakagawa, then-mayor of Takarazuka city, to enter the dohyo to give a speech for an exhibition tournament. Nakagawa, forced to speak from the side of the ring, said she was mortified to be rejected just because she is female.",
      "The sumo association chief apologized over the \u201cfailure to take appropriate action in a life-threatening situation\u201d and for making Nakagawa uncomfortable, and formed a panel of outside experts to examine the female ban. Seven years later, a decision is still pending.",
      "\u201cExcluding women under the premise of male-centered traditions and customs can be no longer justified under the values of the times,\u201d Kobayashi, the professor, said.",

      "Takaichi is trying to win back support from right-wing voters who have been drawn to emerging populist groups in recent elections. An attempt to present the trophy in the ring would be seen as defying sumo's traditions and could harm her image with those voters.",

      "Brazilian former President Jair Bolsonaro is preparing to serve a 27-year sentence for attempting a coup",
      "SAO PAULO -- Simone Guimar\u00e3es, a retired 52-year-old teacher in Rio de Janeiro, lost at least five relatives to COVID-19: her husband, sister, two brothers-in-law and the godfather of her grandchild. She also lost friends and neighbors.",
      "She woke to the news on Saturday that Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the preemptive arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro, whom she blames for her losses. A judge claimed Bolsonaro was intent on escaping days before he was set to begin a 27-year prison sentence for attempting a coup after losing the 2022 presidential election to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small beginning of justice starting to be served,\" she said. \u201cImpunity has to end at some point. And in his case, we endured a lot.\"",
      "Social media filled with posts Saturday remembering people lost to COVID-19, which also happened in September when the Supreme Court convicted Bolsonaro, even though the legal case had nothing to do with the former president's pandemic response.",
      "Guimar\u00e3es followed every vote in Bolsonaro\u2019s trial. She was at a hospital with her sister in 2021 when Bolsonaro, who was president at the time, mimicked patients gasping for air.",
      "\u201cI had my forehead against my sister\u2019s. She said, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe,\u2019\u201d Guimar\u00e3es recalled. Her sister later died. \u201cI can\u2019t even bring myself to say his name.\u201d",
      "She now feels indirectly vindicated, like many other Brazilians who lost relatives to the disease. They say Bolsonaro\u2019s conviction and imprisonment cleansed their souls without delivering justice for their grief.",
      "\u201cI'm very afraid that this conviction for crimes related to the coup will lessen the convictions for other crimes committed during the pandemic,\u201d said Diego Orsi, a 41-year-old translator in Sao Paulo, the nation's largest city. \u201cI feel a bit like the Nuremberg trials had convicted the Nazis for invading Poland, and not for genocide.\"",
      "Orsi grew up alongside his cousin, Henrique Cavalari. They were like brothers. In old family photos, the two appear together blowing out birthday candles.",
      "As teenagers, Cavalari introduced Orsi to rock bands. Politically, however, they drifted apart. Orsi considers himself progressive while Cavalari backed Bolsonaro.",
      "\u201cMy uncle always leaned right, and my cousin grew up with that mindset,\u201d Orsi said. \u201cDuring the pandemic, he became convinced there was nothing to worry about, that social distancing restricted freedom and the priority should be protecting the economy.\u201d",
      "Cavalari ran a motorcycle repair shop and was a staunch Bolsonaro supporter. He couldn\u2019t afford to close his shop and the far-right leader\u2019s rhetoric resonated with the mechanics, who attended his rallies even during the deadliest months of the pandemic.",
      "In June 2021, thousands of the president's supporters rode motorcycles through Sao Paulo with Bolsonaro. That same month, Cavalari died from COVID-19 complications. He was 41.",
      "Orsi wasn\u2019t 100% sure if Cavalari was at the motorcycle rally, but said his cousin attended previous similar events.",
      "\u201cHe was newly married, paying rent on his business. He needed the money,\u201d Orsi said, recalling he couldn't visit Cavalari in the hospital intensive care unit because only immediate family was allowed. \u201cBut I was told one of the last things he said was to warn his parents to take care, that the disease was serious.\"",
      "Orsi\u2019s family remains divided, much like the rest of Brazil, and he believes Bolsonaro\u2019s conviction will not change public opinion or reconcile other families.",
      "Bolsonaro denied wrongdoing during his trial. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected an appeal from his legal team, though another may come this week. Before his arrest Saturday, he had been under house arrest since August.",
      "\u201cI would have preferred that he was arrested for allowing 700,000 Brazilians to die, many deaths that could have been avoided, perhaps by speeding up the vaccine rollout,\u201d Orsi told The Associated Press. \u201cBut since he is being tried and convicted for other crimes, it cleanses our soul. It gives us a sense that justice has been served.\u201d",

      "The pandemic marked a change in course for Bolsonaro\u2019s popularity. During the 2022 campaign, which he lost to Lula, television ads replayed footage of Bolsonaro mocking patients struggling to breathe, which is a common COVID-19 symptom, and highlighted comments widely seen as dismissive of victims and their families.",
      "\u201cBolsonaro lost because of his denialist stance during the pandemic. The margin was very narrow,\u201d said Eduardo Scolese, politics editor at the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper during Bolsonaro\u2019s term and author of \u201c1461 Dias na Trincheira\u201d (\u201d1461 Days in the Trenches\").",
      "The federal government was expected to coordinate Brazil\u2019s early response, Scolese said, but Bolsonaro consistently downplayed the crisis.",
      "\u201cNo one knew how long it would last. Experts called for distancing, while he joined crowds,\" Scolese said.",
      "As the Brazilian leader resisted public health measures, state and local governments imposed their own. The dispute reached the Supreme Court, which ruled states and municipalities could enact distancing, quarantines and other sanitary rules.",

      "Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand says Canada and India will move quickly to get a trade deal after two years of strained relations",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said Monday that Canada and India will move quickly to advance a trade deal after two years of strained relations, noting Ottawa has a new foreign policy in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war.",
      "Anand's statement follows a meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Group of 20 summit in South Africa this past weekend, where the leaders agreed to restart stalled talks for a new trade deal.",
      "Relations between Canada and India have been strained since Canadian police accused New Delhi of playing a role in the June 2023 assassination of a Canadian Sikh activist near Vancouver.",
      "\u201cThe leaders were adamant that this work proceed as quickly as possible so that timing is going to be expeditious,\u201d Anand said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Carney will visit India early next year.",
      "Anand noted Carney's goal to double non-U.S. trade over the next decade. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and more than 75% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the U.S. Most exports to the U.S. are exempted by the USMCA trade agreement but that deal is up for review in 2026.",
      "\u201cThis is a completely new approach to foreign policy that is responsive to the global economic environment in which we find ourselves,\u201d Anand said. \u201cThere is a new government, a new foreign policy, a new prime minister and a new world order where countries are becoming more protectionist and this is a moment for Canada as a trading nation.\"",
      "Canada is also seeking better relations with Beijing. Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping took a step toward mending the long-fractured ties between their countries last month with a meeting at the Asia-Pacific summit.",
      "In 2023, Ottawa suspended trade talks after going public with allegations from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that the Indian government was behind an assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.",
      "Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland.",
      "Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Niijar\u2019s murder and are awaiting trial in Canada.",

      "Anand said both countries expect to be able to double bilateral trade by 2030, to US$50 billion, and noted that Canada is India\u2019s seventh largest trade partner for goods and services, and one of the largest foreign investors in India.",
      "Trump ended trade talks with Carney after the Ontario provincial government ran an anti-tariff advertisement in the U.S., which upset him. That followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over the president\u2019s insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Anand said Canada remains ready to resume trade talks with Trump.",
      "\u201cWe are operating under the fact that the United States has fundamentally changed all of its trading relationships,\" Anand said. \u201cWe look forward to getting back to the table.\u201d",

      "Sinclair has submitted a bid to buy out E",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sinclair has submitted a bid to buy out E.W. Scripps for $7 per share, in a deal that could bring further consolidation across America's local TV news landscape.",
      "Under the proposal, which Sinclair disclosed Monday, the broadcast giant would acquire all of Scripps' outstanding shares that it doesn't already own. Sinclair has already upped its stake in Scripps recently \u2014 accounting for nearly 10% of the company's class A common stock as of Nov. 17, per regulatory filings.",
      "The proposed $7 per share price tag would consist of both cash and stock. If approved, the deal would give Scripps' shareholders about a 12.7% stake of the combined company upon closing.",
      "Sinclair is requesting a response from Scripps by Dec. 5.",
      "\u201cWe are submitting an updated, actionable merger proposal,\u201d Sinclair CEO Christopher S. Ripley wrote in a letter to Scripps\u2019 board. He said the deal would \u201cstrengthen local journalism\u201d and \u201cposition the combined company and employees for long-term success.\u201d",
      "Ohio-based Scripps acknowledged that it had received an \u201cunsolicited acquisition proposal\u201d from Sinclair on Monday. The company said its board would review it like any other offer \u2014 and determine next steps based on the interests of its stakeholders and \"audiences it serves across the United States.\u201d",
      "Scripps previously said it would also protect itself from any \u201copportunistic actions of Sinclair or anyone else.\u201d",
      "Shares of E.W. Scripps Co. jumped more than 5% Monday, trading at about $4.30 apiece as of 2:30 p.m. ET. Sinclair's stock slipped just under 1%, trading around $15.50 by the afternoon.",
      "Sinclair has been eyeing Scripps for some time. Last week, the Maryland-based company said it held months of talks \u201cregarding a potential combination\u201d \u2014 and maintained more broadly that increasing its scale is \u201cessential to address secular headwinds\u201d in the U.S. media industry, pointing to growing competition.",
      "Just this past August, Nexstar Media Group announced a $6.2 billion deal to buy broadcast rival Tegna.",
      "Companies like Sinclair \u2014 as well as Nexstar and Tegna \u2014 have argued that acquisitions would allow them to better compete with both bigger media and tech players vying for consumers\u2019 attention today. But critics warn of wider homogenization of news. In other words, more and more local TV stations becoming \u201cduplicators\u201d of syndicated reporting \u2014 and sharing corporate owners who may decide not to air certain content.",

      "Meanwhile, E.W. Scripps Co. operates more than 60 local stations in over 40 markets. It also owns national news outlets Scripps News and Court TV, as well as entertainment brands like ION.",
      "Whether or not Scripps accepts Sinclair's proposal has yet to be seen. And like all major corporate mergers, the deal would still require the regulatory greenlight. Sinclair on Monday said it was confident that its proposed transaction could be completed under existing rules.",
      "Still, media consolidation could accelerate industrywide if the Trump administration loosens restrictions \u2014 or, perhaps more immediately, makes exceptions for certain mergers. Just last week, in efforts to complete its Tegna acquisition, Nexstar asked the Federal Communications Commission for a waiver on current rules that limit the number of stations a single company can own.",
      "FCC Chairman Brendan Carr previously signaled openness to changing those requirements overall. But some conservatives \u2014 and Trump himself \u2014 have recently expressed disdain over the possibility of such a change leading to an expansion in networks they view as left-leaning.",
      "\u201cIf this would also allow the Radical Left Networks to \u2018enlarge,\u2019 I would not be happy,\" President Donald Trump wrote on social media Sunday. The Republican particularly targeted ABC and NBC, which he claimed were a \u201cVIRTUAL ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY.\u201d",
      "In response, Nexstar maintained that it believes \u201cthe landscape is ripe for regulatory reform\u201d \u2014 and added that \u201cwe agree with President Trump that the status quo is no longer acceptable.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- One of the most storied American philanthropies is teaming up with the internet's biggest creator to instill young people with a concern for what they call the world's \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d populations.",
      "Beast Philanthropy, the charitable organization started by MrBeast founder Jimmy Donaldson, and the Rockefeller Foundation announced a strategic partnership Monday. The idea is to pair Donaldson's unique ability to capture youth attention spans with the foundation's 112-year history of using its resources and technology to tackle global problems.",
      "Speaking together ahead of a Nov. 21 video shoot at MrBeast's Greenville, North Carolina, studio, the partners complimented the respective strengths they hope to exchange with each other.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life making YouTube videos. They\u2019ve spent their entire lives helping people,\" Donaldson told The Associated Press. \"Obviously, they have a team who\u2019s way more experienced than me in helping people, but being able to pull on their knowledge and wisdom is amazing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just want to download their brains into our team\u2019s brains,\" he added.",
      "Dr. Rajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said the philanthropic sector has long failed to capture \u201cthe hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of young people.\u201d He said MrBeast can help them engage young people, inspire hope and communicate their work more accessibly.",
      "Most people have a natural desire to help others, according to Shah, but we teach ourselves that world problems are \u201ctoo big and too complicated\u201d to solve. He pointed to MrBeast's video in Zambia, where they provided a village with solar-powered electricity and clean water wells.",
      "\"What Jimmy\u2019s already done is show that you can change that dramatically,\u201d Shah said. \"If we can get people believing that they can make a difference through this collaboration, we will have achieved something really unique and really special.\u201d",
      "The move signals Donaldson's continued attempts to evolve an organization with sprawling interests that include an entertainment studio, food brands, his own James Patterson book deal and, most recently, a limited time theme park in Saudi Arabia. He brought on venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold as CEO last year and then hired more new executives as a series of controversies threatened his ambitions ahead of his Amazon Prime reality game show 's release.",
      "It's an unlikely marriage to some. The Rockefeller Foundation is a pillar of civil society established with wealth amassed by the 19th-century oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller during the Gilded Age whereas the 27-year-old Donaldson represents the 21st century \u201cinfluencer\u201d economy where entire media empires can emerge from content creators' viral stunts and the online buzz they generate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an influencer like MrBeast embrace the expertise of established philanthropy \u2014 of the Rockefeller Foundation, in particular \u2014 to hone the work of his platform,\u201d said Phila Engaged Giving founder Stephanie Ellis-Smith. \u201cHonestly, to me, it shows a sense of humility in his approach that I personally haven\u2019t seen before.\"",

      "Shah acknowledged that the Rockefeller Foundation rarely does partnerships of this kind. But he said that spending time with Donaldson and his mother, as well as watching his philanthropically minded videos, communicated the YouTube megastar's \u201cpersonal commitment to philanthropy.\"",

      "Bird flu and another disease have shrunk the U.S. turkey population to a 40-year low this year",
      "CHELSEA, Mich. -- Old Brick Farm, where Larry Doll raises chickens, turkeys and ducks, was fortunate this Thanksgiving season.",
      "Doll's small farm west of Detroit had no cases of bird flu, despite an ongoing outbreak that killed more than 2 million U.S. turkeys in the last three months alone. He also avoided another disease, avian metapneumovirus, which causes turkeys to lay fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cI try to keep the operation as clean as possible, and not bringing other animals in from other farms helps mitigate that risk as well,\u201d said Doll, whose farm has been in his family for five generations.",
      "But Doll still saw the impact as those diseases shrank the U.S. turkey flock to a 40-year low this year. The hatchery where he gets his turkey chicks had fewer available this year. He plans to order another 100 hatchlings soon, even though they won\u2019t arrive until July.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get your order in early, you\u2019re not going to get it,\u201d he said.",
      "The shrinking population is expected to cause wholesale turkey prices to rise 44% this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the increase, many stores are offering discounted or even free turkeys to soften the potential blow to Thanksgiving meal budgets. But even if the bird is cheaper than last year, the ingredients to prepare the rest of the holiday feast may not be. Tariffs on imported steel, for example, have increased prices for canned goods.",
      "As of Nov. 17, a basket of 11 Thanksgiving staples \u2014 including a 10-pound frozen turkey, 10 Russet potatoes, a box of stuffing and cans of corn, green beans and cranberry sauce \u2013 cost $58.81, or 4.1% more than last year, according to Datasembly, a market research company that surveys weekly prices at 150,000 U.S. stores. That\u2019s higher than the average price increase for food eaten at home, which rose 2.7% in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Datasembly showed a 2% decline in the retail price of a 10-pound turkey as of Nov. 17. Pricing out Thanksgiving meals isn\u2019t an exact science, and the firm's tally differed from other estimates.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation, which uses volunteer shoppers in all 50 states to survey prices, reported that Thanksgiving dinner for 10 would cost $55.16 this year, or 5% less than last year. The Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, using NielsenIQ data from September, estimated that feeding 10 people on Thursday using store-brand products would cost $80 this year, which is 2% to 3% lower than last year's estimate.",
      "Grocery chains are also offering deals to attract shoppers. Discount grocer Aldi is advertising a $40 meal for 10 with 21 items. Kroger said shoppers could feed 10 people for under $50 with its menu of store-brand products.",
      "Earlier this month, President Donald Trump touted Walmart\u2019s Thanksgiving meal basket, which he said was 25% cheaper than last year. But that was because Walmart included a different assortment and fewer products overall this year.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing some promotions being implemented in an effort to draw customers into the store,\u201d David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University, said.",
      "That's despite a sharp increase in wholesale turkey prices since August. In the second week of November, frozen 8-16 pound hens were averaging $1.77 per pound, up 81% from the same period last year, according to Mark Jordan, the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, which closely follows the poultry and livestock markets.",

      "\u201cFor a big chunk of the population, they look at steak cuts and say, \u2018I can\u2019t or I don\u2019t want to pay $30 a pound,\u2019\u201d Jordan said.",
      "That\u2019s the case for Paul Nadeau, a retired consultant from Austin, Texas, who plans to smoke a turkey this week. Nadeau said he usually smokes a brisket over Thanksgiving weekend, but the beef brisket he buys would now cost more than $100. Turkey prices are also up at his local H-E-B supermarket, he said, but not by as much.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of anything that\u2019s down in price since last year except for eggs,\u201d Nadeau said.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum are also raising prices. Farok Contractor, a distinguished professor of management and global business at the Rutgers Business School, said customers are paying 10 cents to 40 cents more per can when companies pass on the full cost of tariffs.",
      "Tariffs may be partly to blame for the increased cost of jellied cranberry sauce, which was up 38% from last year in Datasembly\u2019s survey. But weather was also a factor. U.S. cranberry production is expected to be down 9% this year, hurt by drought conditions in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "In Illinois, where most of the country\u2019s canning pumpkins are grown, dry weather actually helped pumpkins avoid diseases that are more prevalent in wet conditions, said Raghela Scavuzzo, an associate director of food systems development at the Illinois Farm Bureau and the executive director of the Illinois Specialty Growers Association. Datasembly found that a 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix cost 5% less than last year.",
      "Back at Old Brick Farm, which has been in his family since 1864, Doll walked among his turkeys the week before Thanksgiving, patting their heads as they waddled between their warm barn and an open pasture. In a few days, he planned to deliver them to an Amish butcher.",
      "Doll sold all 92 turkeys he raised this year, with customers paying $6.50 per pound for what many tell him is the best turkey they've ever tasted. He enjoys a little profit, he said, and the good feeling of supplying a holiday meal.",
      "\u201cI just love it, to think that, you know, not only are we providing them food, but the centerpiece of their Thanksgiving dinner,\u201d he said.",

      "Chinese companies are rushing to deploy low-flying vehicles and drones for various uses as the country finds innovative ways to drive its economy",
      "HONG KONG -- An unmanned, oval-shaped craft from flying taxi maker EHang hovers, whirring noisily like a mini-helicopter over a riverside innovation zone on the outskirts of the southern Chinese business hub of Guangzhou, part of a trial of a mini-flying taxi that once might have been found only in sci-fi films.",
      "In nearby Shenzhen, food-delivery drones already are part of daily life and a novelty attraction for tourists, even if such services cost more. In the waterfront park surrounded by high-rises, Polish tourist Karolina Trzcia\u0144ska and her friends ordered bubble tea and lemon tea by phone, just to give it a try. Their drinks arrived via a drone buzzing through the drizzle about 30 minutes later.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m seeing something like this, so it was super fun to see the food being delivered by the drone,\" she said.",
      "Such businesses are growing quickly with support from the government, though the take off of the so-called \u201clow-altitude economy\u201d faces obstacles such as strict airspace controls and battery limitations.",
      "Activities in airspace below 1,000 meters (about 3,280 feet) accounted for business turnover worth 506 billion yuan ($70 billion) in 2023, about 0.4% of China\u2019s economy. By 2035, it's expected to hit 3.5 trillion yuan (about $490 billion), said Zhang Xiaolan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a think tank affiliated with China's main planning agency.",
      "Guangdong province, home to drone giant DJI with an estimated 70% of the global commercial drone market, leads in development of the low-altitude economy, followed by wealthy eastern coastal provinces Jiangsu and Zhejiang, near Shanghai, according to a report by a research unit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, and other institutions.",
      "Other big players in Guangdong include EHang, logistics company SF Express\u2019s drone arm Phoenix Wings, and automaker XPENG\u2019s flying car unit ARIDGE.",
      "In October, Guangdong announced it plans to speed up construction of flight service stations and platforms to facilitate airspace operations and will support locally issued discount vouchers for low-altitude tourism.",
      "Its technology and financial hub Shenzhen has launched a 15-million-yuan ($2.1 million) award for companies that earn certifications required for passenger eVTOLs, short for \u201celectric vertical take-off and landing\" vehicles that lift off the ground like helicopters, among other incentives.",
      "China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration has granted certificates allowing EHang to offer commercial passenger services with its pilotless eVTOL, a low-altitude aircraft that can reach speeds of 130 kph (81 mph) with a maximum range of 30 kilometers (19 miles).",
      "EHang hasn\u2019t launched commercial routes, but its vice president, He Tianxing, says it aims to start with aerial sightseeing services. The company has been building takeoff and landing sites in 20 Chinese cities over the past two years. He expects aircraft of various companies will be flying multiple routes, possibly after five years.",
      "He envisions eventual citywide networks using the rooftops of malls, schools and parks as terminals.",
      "\u201cIt can\u2019t just be a research product, nor an engineer\u2019s toy,\u201d he said.",
      "The biggest challenge for developing eVTOL aircraft is maintaining longer flights and overcoming battery capacity limitations, said Guo Liming, co-founder of Shenzhen-based Skyevtol, whose single-seat manned eVTOL aircraft, priced at around $100,000, can only fly 20 to 30 minutes before it must be charged.",
      "It also has not all been smooth skies.",
      "In September, two XPENG's eVTOL aircraft collided after a rehearsal for an exhibition and one of them caught fire while landing. The company said no one was hurt, but another expo canceled flying demonstrations a week later.",

      "\u201cPerhaps for some Southeast Asian countries, if I introduce these applications to them, their demand could explode,\u201d he said.",
      "Less than one-third of China's low-altitude airspace was accessible for general aviation use in 2023 and there were problems with uneven distribution and a lack of internet connectivity, Zhang, the State Information Center researcher, said in a report. The number of registered general aviation aerodromes in China, excluding private airports, was just about a tenth of those in the U.S., she said.",

But development of the technologies involved and safety concerns and public acceptance will determine how quickly different applications of drones and low-flying vehicles are adopted.",

      "At least five families say their babies were treated for infant botulism after consuming ByHeart formula months before a current outbreak was detected",
      "As health officials investigate more than 30 cases of infant botulism linked to ByHeart baby formula since August, parents who say their children were sickened with the same illness months before the current outbreak are demanding answers, too.",
      "California public health officials confirmed late Friday that six babies in that state who consumed ByHeart formula were treated for botulism between November 2024 and June 2025, up to nine months before the outbreak that has sickened at least 31 babies in 15 states.",
      "At the time, there was \u201cnot enough evidence to immediately suspect a common source,\" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement.",
      "Even now, \"we cannot connect any pre-August 1 cases to the current outbreak,\u201d officials said.",
      "Parents of at least five babies said that their infants were treated for the rare and potentially deadly disease after drinking ByHeart formula in late 2024 and early 2025, according to reports shared with The Associated Press by Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer representing the families.",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking bottles filled with ByHeart formula.",
      "Katie Connolly, 37, of Lafayette, California, said her daughter, M.C., then 8 months old, was hospitalized in April and treated for botulism after being fed ByHeart formula in hopes of helping the baby sleep.",
      "For months, neither mother had any idea where the infections could have originated. Such illnesses in babies typically are caused by spores spread in the environment or by contaminated honey.",
      "Then ByHeart recalled all of its products nationwide on Nov. 11 in connection with growing cases of infant botulism.",
      "As soon as she heard it was ByHeart, Mazziotti said she thought: \u201cThis cannot be a coincidence.\u201d",
      "ByHeart officials this week confirmed that laboratory tests of previously unopened formula found that some samples were contaminated with the type of bacteria that leads to infant botulism.",
      "Marler said at least three other cases that predate the outbreak involved babies who drank ByHeart and were treated for botulism, according to their families. One consumed ByHeart formula in December 2024. The other two were sickened later in the spring, he said.",
      "An official with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said federal investigators were aware of reports of earlier illnesses but that efforts are focused now on understanding the unusual surge of dozens of infections documented since Aug. 1.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not necessarily part of this,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the probe. \u201cIt\u2019s just that right now, we\u2019re focusing on this large increase.\u201d",
      "Because so much time has passed and because parents of babies who got sick earlier may not have recorded lot numbers of product or kept empty cans of formula, \u201cit will make it harder to definitively link them\u201d to the outbreak, Cope said.",

      "Cope and other health officials said the strong signal connecting ByHeart to infant botulism cases only became apparent in recent weeks.",
      "Before this outbreak, no powdered infant formula in the U.S. had tested positive for the type of bacteria that leads to botulism, California health officials said. The number of cases also were within an expected range. A test of a can of open formula fed to a sick baby in the spring did not detect the bacterium.",
      "Then, beginning in August and through October, more cases were identified on the East Coast involving a type of toxin rarely detected in the region, officials said. More cases were seen in very young infants and more cases involved ByHeart formula, which accounts for less than 1 percent of infant formula sold in the U.S.",
      "Earlier this month, after a sample from a can of ByHeart formula fed to a sick infant tested positive for the germ that leads to illness, officials notified the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the public.",
      "Less than 200 cases of infant botulism are reported in the U.S. each year. The disease is caused when babies ingest spores that germinate in the gut and produce a toxin. The bacterium that leads to illness is ubiquitous in the environment, including soil and water, so the source is often unknown.",
      "Officials at the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program track reports of botulism and the distribution of the only treatment for the illness, an IV medication called BabyBIG.",
      "Outside food safety experts said the CDC should count earlier cases as part of the outbreak if babies consumed ByHeart formula and were treated for botulism.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely, yes, they should be included,\u201d said Frank Yiannas, former deputy commissioner for food policy and response at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they be included?\u201d",

      "Connolly and Mazziotti said their babies are improving, though they still have some lingering effects. Botulism causes symptoms that include constipation, poor feeding, head and limb weakness and other problems.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to back down from some tariffs is being celebrated by tea importers, who say the levies have been devastating this year",
      "NEW YORK -- A tax on tea once sparked rebellion. This time, it\u2019s just causing headaches.",
      "Importers of the prized leaves have watched costs climb, orders stall and margins shrink under the weight of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Now, even after Trump has given them a reprieve, tea traders say it won\u2019t immediately undo the damage.",
      "\u201cIt took a while to work its way through the system, these tariffs, and it will take a while for it to work its way out of the system,\u201d says Bruce Richardson, a celebrated tea master, tea historian and purveyor of teas at his shop, Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, in Danville, Kentucky. \u201cThat tariffed tea is still working its way out of our warehouses.\u201d",
      "While a handful of bigger firms are behind the biggest supermarket brands, the premium tea market is largely the work of smaller businesses, from family farms to specialty importers to a web of little tea shops, tea rooms and tea cafes across the U.S. Amid an onslaught of tariffs, they have become showcases for the levies\u2019 effects.",
      "On their shelves, selection has narrowed, with some teas now missing because they\u2019re no longer viable products to stock with steep levies on top. In their warehouses, managers are consumed with uncertainty and operational headaches, including calculating what a blend really costs, with ingredients from multiple countries on a roller coaster of tariffs. And in backrooms where the wafting scent of fresh tea permeates, owners have been forced to put off job postings, raises, advertising and other investments so they can have cash available to pay duties when their containers arrive at U.S. ports.",
      "\u201cIf I were to add up all the money I\u2019ve spent on tariffs that weren\u2019t there a year ago, it could equal a new employee,\u201d says Hartley Johnson, who owns the Mark T. Wendell Tea Company in Acton, Massachusetts.",
      "Johnson\u2019s prices used to stay static for a year or longer. He ate the tariff costs before being forced to respond. His most popular tea, a smoky Taiwanese one called Hu-Kwa, has steadily risen from $26 to $46 a pound.",
      "He knows some customers are reconsidering.",
      "\u201cWhere is that tipping point?\u201d Johnson asks. \u201cI\u2019m kind of finding that tipping point is happening now.\u201d",
      "Though Trump backed off some tariffs on agricultural products last week, many in the tea trade are wary of celebrating too soon and caution tea drinkers shouldn\u2019t either. Much of next year\u2019s supply has already been imported and tariffed and the full impact of those duties may not have fully spilled downhill.",
      "Meantime, other tariff-driven price hikes persist. All sorts of other products tea businesses import, from teapots to infusers, remain subject to levies, and costs for some American-made items, like tins for packaging, have spiked because they rely on foreign materials.",
      "\u201cThe canisters, the bamboo boxes, the matcha whisks, everything that we import, everything that we sell has been affected by tariffs,\u201d says Gilbert Tsang, owner of MEM Tea Imports in Wakefield, Massachusetts.",
      "Though globally, tea reigns supreme, imbibed more than anything but water, it has long been overshadowed by coffee in the U.S. Still, tea is entwined in American history from the very beginning, even before colonists angry with tariffs dumped tons of it in Boston Harbor.",
      "Boston may run on Dunkin\u2019 today, but it was born on tea.",
      "The 1773 revolt that became known as the Boston Tea Party rose out of the British Parliament\u2019s implementation of tea tariffs on colonists, who rejected taxation without representation in government. After an independent United States was born, one of the new government\u2019s first major acts, the Tariff Act of 1789, ironically set in law import taxes on a range of products including tea. In time, though, trade policy came to include carve-outs for many products Americans rely on but don\u2019t produce.",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- With a spotlight on the Brazilian Amazon, where agriculture drives a significant chunk of deforestation and planet-warming emissions, many of the activists, scientists and government leaders at United Nations climate talks have a beef. They want more to be done to transform the world's food system.",
      "Protesters gathered outside a new space at the talks, the industry-sponsored \u201cAgrizone,\u201d to call for a transition toward a more grassroots food system, even as hundreds of lobbyists for big agriculture companies are attending the talks.",
      "Though agriculture contributes about a third of Earth-warming emissions worldwide, most of the money dedicated to fighting climate change goes to causes other than agriculture, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.",
      "The FAO didn't offer any single answer as to how that spending should be shifted, or on what foods people should be eating.",
      "\u201cAll the countries are coming together. I don\u2019t think we can impose on them one specific worldview,\u201d said Kaveh Zahedi, director of the organization's Office of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment.",
      "Research has generally shown that a plant-based diet can be better for health and the planet. But many people in poverty around the world who are hardest hit by climate change depend on animal sources of protein for survival. People in higher-income countries have more options for a healthy diet without meat. But those people still tend to contribute more to climate change with their dietary choices.",
      "\"We have to be very, very aware and conscious of those nuances, those differences that exist,\u201d Zahedi said.",
      "When world leaders gather every year to try to address climate change, they spend much of their time in a giant, artificial world that typically gets built up just for the conference.",
      "One corner of COP30, as this year's conference is known, featured the alternative universe of AgriZone, where visitors could step into a world of immersive videos and exhibits with live plants and food products. Those included a research farm that Brazilian national agricultural research corporation Embrapa built to showcase what they call low-carbon farming methods for raising cattle, and growing crops like corn and soy as well as ways to integrate cover crops like legumes or trees like teak and eucalyptus.",
      "Ana Euler, executive director of innovation, business and technology transfer at Embrapa, said her industry can offer solutions needed especially in the Global South where climate change is hitting hardest.",
      "\"We need to be part of the discussions in terms of climate funds,\" Euler said. \"We researchers, we speak loud, but nobody listens.\u201d",
      "AgriZone was averaging about 2,000 visitors a day during COP30's two-week run, said Gabriel Faria, an Embrapa spokesman. That included tours for Queen Mary of Denmark, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago and other Brazilian state and local officials.",

      "She waited for agents to move a few blocks away, then opened their stand serving Mexican-style corn on the cob and \u201caguas frescas\u201d flavored with cucumber, pineapple and strawberry in the heart of the Mexican immigrant community, just as they've done for 18 years. Sirens blared through a chaotic day as Chicago police responded to a Border Patrol call for help and confronted demonstrators.",
      "Herrera, 47, and Rafael Hernandez, 44, have refused to alter their routines during an immigration enforcement blitz in Chicago that has caused many without legal status to stay home since it began in early September. Even some U.S. citizens of Latino heritage are afraid to go outside.",
      "The couple says working not only pays the bills but helps avoid depression, making them stand out from others gripped by fear in Chicago's immigrant communities.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you can do is have faith in God and not be afraid,\u201d Herrera said in an interview at the couple's South Side house, already bedecked with Christmas decorations just days after Halloween. \u201cFear gives way to depression and other things. At the end of the day, they don't deport you to Mexico but you are sick with depression and other things because you didn't have faith in God.\u201d",
      "Hernandez agreed. \"We know people who have fallen into depression. They don't leave the house. It's very sad.\u201d",
      "The couple's Little Village food stand, adorned with American flags, is in a bustling area the Border Patrol has visited often. The two-lane commercial drag is lined with family-owned restaurants serving birria and chilaquiles, and clothing stores with displays of Mexican sports team jerseys and white dresses for quincea\u00f1era parties \u2014 a coming-of-age celebration for 15-year-old girls in Latino families.",
      "Vendors sell sliced fruit and pottery from parked vehicles. Strains of ranchera music from cars and shops add to the festive atmosphere, drawing Mexican immigrant visitors from across Chicago and beyond. A family from Waterloo, Iowa, nibbled corn smothered in mayonnaise, cotija cheese, lime and chili powder at the couple's stand under a cold drizzle.",
      "Many of the couple\u2019s friends haven\u2019t ventured outside in more than two months. That fear has sparked a grassroots effort to buy out street vendors, allowing them to go home early and avoid public exposure.",
      "Sidewalk traffic on 26th Street is livelier than many commercial areas in Chicago, even with the immigration crackdown. It is lined with barber shops, groceries and other businesses that have signs in Spanish and English demanding immigration authorities stay away unless they have a court warrant.",
      "The couple knows people who were arrested by heavily armed agents asking about their legal status \u2014 an egg vendor here, a tamale vendor there. They described the sting of tear gas unleashed by agents on demonstrators at a shopping center parking lot last month.",
      "Many immigrants, even some with legal status, are loathe to speak with reporters, especially if identified by name, fearful it may lead to deportation. Herrera and Hernandez say they are eager to share their story to foster understanding of how the Trump administration's push for mass deportations is playing out.",
      "Herrera crossed the border in 2004, followed later by her two children who are now adults living in Chicago. Hernandez made the journey in 2005. Both paid smugglers thousands of dollars for dayslong treks through the Arizona desert. Acquaintances enticed them to head to Chicago, the second-highest U.S. destination for Mexican immigrants after Los Angeles.",
      "The couple met while working at a Mexican restaurant in Little Village. They have two U.S.-born children; their 10-year-old son speaks little Spanish and has been largely oblivious to the immigration crackdown.",

      "\u201cRental Family,\u201d a moving drama from Searchlight Pictures starring Brendan Fraser, is sure to spark interest in Japan\u2019s real-life industry",
      "TOKYO -- Ryuichi Ichinokawa's life could be right out of the movie \u201cRental Family\u201d as the founder nearly two decades ago of the Heart Project business in Japan, which he bills as a surrogate attendance service complete with furnishing of extras and family members.",
      "He has hired dozens of people to act like reporters with cameras and voice recorders, taking notes and milling with real journalists to fill up an otherwise rather vacant event. He has posed as the boyfriend of a woman who needs to discuss legal paperwork with her former spouse. And he has gone to a hospital as a stand-in husband for a woman getting fertility treatments.",
      "\u201cI am being of service to people. I hope they will be happy,\u201d said Ichinokawa, a dapper elderly man who asked The Associated Press to not be photographed lest his identity become public.",
      "\u201cRental Family,\u201d a moving drama from Searchlight Pictures starring Brendan Fraser, is sure to spark interest in Japan's real-life industry. The film, which opens in theaters Friday, centers on Phillip, an American actor who is recruited by a Tokyo \u201crental family\u201d agency in need of a \u201ctoken white guy.\u201d His recurring jobs range from playing video games with a loner to portraying a little girl's long absentee father. It isn't long before Phillip starts to become emotionally invested in what were supposed to be superficial relationships. The film's Japanese supporting cast also bring to life the intense highs and lows of assuming a role in a stranger's life.",
      "In reality, these niche businesses highlight how deeply people in Japan experience loneliness or worry about keeping up appearances. Outsiders may cringe at the idea of paying amateur actors to be fake family members or friends. But users say they find these services comforting and even healing.",
      "The film's director, Mitsuyo Miyazaki whose professional name is Hikari, was born in Japan yet knew little about the concept. Once she learned about it, she couldn't stop thinking about what a unique story it could inspire. So Hikari started researching and found hundreds of companies in Japan that offer rental families or similar services. She spoke with several people in that world.",
      "\u201cI kind of started tackling those questions, and interviewed them on what are the necessities of the business that needs to happen in Japan. And then that\u2019s how I kind of built stories,\u201d Hikari said.",
      "Even at a time when people seek company through Artificial Intelligence, she thinks hiring of actors to fill emotional voids will always be in demand.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they will disappear, honestly, it might just probably expand,\u201d she said.",
      "In Ichinokawa's experience, most people who ask for the service have a certain social status to protect. He has organized visits to a bar for a hostess who wants to impress her employer with lots of clientele. Similar to the movie, Ichinokawa has gone to school events with a single mother and her child, acting as a friendly uncle.",
      "Sometimes Ichinokawa takes extra steps to ensure the facade. If required, he will print fake business cards \u2014 which are routinely exchanged at Japanese gatherings.",
      "Some parts are easy, like being a wedding guest who just sits and eats. But it\u2019s often stressful work. You're coached to avoid uttering the wrong name or background information. You might have to be prepared to talk about childhood memories you have no clue about. Ichinokawa used to scribble names on his hand. He also pores over notes in advance. If he's really desperate, he excuses himself to the restroom.",
      "Payment for getting rented out varies. For Heart Project, the relatively easy roles can make 9,800 yen ($63) for a couple of hours. For the more elaborate parts, the client dishes out 20,000 yen ($130) to 30,000 yen ($190) per person.",
      "Ichinokawa's rule is that you only play a role once. To do it more than once is setting yourself up for failure. And he has never failed in his mission, he added proudly.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel I am acting. I really get angry if that\u2019s what the situation requires,\u201d he said.",
      "Japan has long grappled with loneliness, high suicide rates and a stigma surrounding mental illness. After a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the country examined how the disasters were affecting mental health, said Miwa Yasui, a professor at the University of Chicago whose research includes the influence of culture on mental health.",

      "\u201cWhen people feel they\u2019re not loved, they are not accepted, they\u2019re now seeing they\u2019re not heard. The sense of \u2018I don\u2019t matter\u2019 is a form of loneliness,\u201d said Ozawa-de Silva, who is also a professor at Emory University.",
      "This can lead to \u201chikikomori,\u201d where people withdraw socially and become shut-ins for months or even years.",
      "Japanese culture's collectivist nature also contributes to hiding mental health challenges. Children are taught the principle of \u201cminna no tame ni\" or for the sake of everybody, Yasui said. As adults, there is pressure to maintain harmony and make sure the needs of others \u2014 work or family \u2014 are met.",
      "\u201cWithin Asian cultures, there\u2019s a concept of loss of face,\u201d Yasui said. \u201cIf you lose that, that actually has significant implications.\u201d",
      "In Ozawa-de Silva's opinion, renting actors for surface-level intimacy is putting a \u201cBand-Aid\" on a deeper problem.",
      "\u201cI'm not against that,\u201d Ozawa-de Silva said. \u201cIf people can buy time by renting a family, while pursuing much better long-term solutions, I think the rental family could be a very, very beneficial thing.\u201d",
      "While someone with a Western mindset might find renting actors bizarre, many Japanese people find it reassuring. Much of the written feedback Ichinokawa gets expresses relief or appreciation: \u201cThank you for today. You really interacted with us like a real mother. My boyfriend kept saying, \u2018What a great mom.\u2019\u201d From a male client: \u201cPlease relay my regards to the person who played the role of my wife and tell her she was a superb wife.\u201d",
      "The film, which will be released in February in Japan, uses the rental family concept to remind people that human nature's need for connection is not something you can suppress.",
      "\u201cWhen you help somebody and if they feel like you\u2019re being supportive, that makes you feel good,\u201d Hikari said. \u201cAnd a family member doesn\u2019t have to be alway blood-related.\u201d",

      "Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said Sunday the Cabinet approved the move as part of a broader effort to shield young people from online harm like cyberbullying, scams and sexual exploitation. He said the government is studying approaches taken by Australia and other countries, and the potential use of electronic checks with identity cards or passports to verify users\u2019 ages. He did not say when exactly the ban will be enforced.",
      "\u201cI believe that if the government, regulatory bodies, and parents all play their roles, we can ensure that the Internet in Malaysia is not only fast, widespread and affordable but most importantly, safe, especially for children and families,\u201d he said.",
      "Since January, major social media and messaging platforms with at least 8 million users in Malaysia are required to obtain a licence as part of a broader tightening of state oversight over digital platforms. Licensed platforms must implement age verification, content-safety measures and transparency rules, reflecting the government\u2019s push for a safer digital space.",

      "Chinese companies are rushing to deploy low-flying vehicles and drones for various uses as the country finds innovative ways to drive its economy",
      "HONG KONG -- An unmanned, oval-shaped craft from flying taxi maker EHang hovers, whirring noisily like a mini-helicopter over a riverside innovation zone on the outskirts of the southern Chinese business hub of Guangzhou, part of a trial of a mini-flying taxi that once might have been found only in sci-fi films.",
      "In nearby Shenzhen, food-delivery drones already are part of daily life and a novelty attraction for tourists, even if such services cost more. In the waterfront park surrounded by high-rises, Polish tourist Karolina Trzcia\u0144ska and her friends ordered bubble tea and lemon tea by phone, just to give it a try. Their drinks arrived via a drone buzzing through the drizzle about 30 minutes later.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m seeing something like this, so it was super fun to see the food being delivered by the drone,\" she said.",
      "Such businesses are growing quickly with support from the government, though the take off of the so-called \u201clow-altitude economy\u201d faces obstacles such as strict airspace controls and battery limitations.",
      "Activities in airspace below 1,000 meters (about 3,280 feet) accounted for business turnover worth 506 billion yuan ($70 billion) in 2023, about 0.4% of China\u2019s economy. By 2035, it's expected to hit 3.5 trillion yuan (about $490 billion), said Zhang Xiaolan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a think tank affiliated with China's main planning agency.",
      "Guangdong province, home to drone giant DJI with an estimated 70% of the global commercial drone market, leads in development of the low-altitude economy, followed by wealthy eastern coastal provinces Jiangsu and Zhejiang, near Shanghai, according to a report by a research unit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, and other institutions.",
      "Other big players in Guangdong include EHang, logistics company SF Express\u2019s drone arm Phoenix Wings, and automaker XPENG\u2019s flying car unit ARIDGE.",
      "In October, Guangdong announced it plans to speed up construction of flight service stations and platforms to facilitate airspace operations and will support locally issued discount vouchers for low-altitude tourism.",
      "Its technology and financial hub Shenzhen has launched a 15-million-yuan ($2.1 million) award for companies that earn certifications required for passenger eVTOLs, short for \u201celectric vertical take-off and landing\" vehicles that lift off the ground like helicopters, among other incentives.",
      "China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration has granted certificates allowing EHang to offer commercial passenger services with its pilotless eVTOL, a low-altitude aircraft that can reach speeds of 130 kph (81 mph) with a maximum range of 30 kilometers (19 miles).",
      "EHang hasn\u2019t launched commercial routes, but its vice president, He Tianxing, says it aims to start with aerial sightseeing services. The company has been building takeoff and landing sites in 20 Chinese cities over the past two years. He expects aircraft of various companies will be flying multiple routes, possibly after five years.",

      "\u201cIt can\u2019t just be a research product, nor an engineer\u2019s toy,\u201d he said.",
      "The biggest challenge for developing eVTOL aircraft is maintaining longer flights and overcoming battery capacity limitations, said Guo Liming, co-founder of Shenzhen-based Skyevtol, whose single-seat manned eVTOL aircraft, priced at around $100,000, can only fly 20 to 30 minutes before it must be charged.",
      "It also has not all been smooth skies.",
      "In September, two XPENG's eVTOL aircraft collided after a rehearsal for an exhibition and one of them caught fire while landing. The company said no one was hurt, but another expo canceled flying demonstrations a week later.",

      "\u201cPerhaps for some Southeast Asian countries, if I introduce these applications to them, their demand could explode,\u201d he said.",
      "Less than one-third of China's low-altitude airspace was accessible for general aviation use in 2023 and there were problems with uneven distribution and a lack of internet connectivity, Zhang, the State Information Center researcher, said in a report. The number of registered general aviation aerodromes in China, excluding private airports, was just about a tenth of those in the U.S., she said.",

      "One advantage is the ruling Communist Party's ability to mobilize regulators, industry players and universities to work toward the same goal, he said. But development of the technologies involved and safety concerns and public acceptance will determine how quickly different applications of drones and low-flying vehicles are adopted.",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks will soon decide on a newly forged final deal released on Saturday that does not include a plan to wean the world from the coal, oil and gas that is heating the planet.",
      "While guidelines wanted by 80 nations for a fossil fuel phase-out are not in the document called \u201cUniting humanity in a global mobilization against climate change,\u201d the Brazilian presidency has promised it will join Colombia in coming up with an independent road map that's not needed to be approved by all 190 nations.",
      "\u201cWhile far from what's needed, the outcome in Belem is meaningful progress,\u201d said former German special climate envoy Jennifer Morgan, who is now a fellow at Tufts University.",
      "The conference leaders are aiming for an early afternoon meeting with all nations to approve the deal. Some nations could try to scuttle it if they prefer no deal to what they consider a feeble agreement, but Morgan said she doubted that any country will block the agreement. It was crafted after more than 12 hours of late night and early morning meetings in COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago's office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weak outcome,\" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.",
      "A fossil fuel transition plan will be in a separate proposal issued later by do Lago's team that won't carry the same weight as a deal accepted by nations at the conference.",
      "In the text, instead of a transition plan away from fossil fuels, the agreement \u201cacknowledges that the global transition toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future,\u201d and says \u201cthe (2015) Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster.\u201d",
      "The annual talks this year are held in Belem, a Brazilian city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They were scheduled to wrap up Friday, but negotiators blew past that deadline and worked through the night.",
      "Some of the biggest issues include how to distribute $300 billion a year \u2014 a sum previously agreed upon \u2014 in financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change, getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions and dealing with climate trade barriers. Poorer nations have requested a tripling of financial aid for adapting to extreme weather and other climate change harms. While that's in the deal, the deadline has been moved back five years to 2035.",
      "Also included in the agreement is the final result of the Action Agenda, which was a list of initiatives aimed at making progress on past deals. That included: a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation.",
      "Whatever deal is proposed still needs a consensus approval from what\u2019s left of the nearly 200 nations that came to the two-week conference. Some delegates, observers and others had to leave Saturday morning when the cruise ships lodging them set sail.",

But other countries including Saudi Arabia pushed back against the call to transition away from fossil fuels.",

      "Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva had pushed for a stronger plan to move away from fossil fuels, as did more than 80 countries. But the earlier proposal by do Lago \u2014 a Lula appointee \u2014 didn\u2019t even mention the words \u201cfossil fuel.\u201d",
      "Agreements coming out of COP30 technically have to be approved by consensus. But in the past, individual countries' objections have been overlooked by the chair in the rush to gavel everything to the end.",
      "One of the points that negotiators will highlight is language sprinkled in the document that won\u2019t be an explicit road map away from fossil fuels, but will refer back to previous agreements to maintain momentum and \"live and fight another day,\u201d said Alden Meyer, a veteran analyst for the European think-tank E3G.",

      "Grok has a history of making antisemitic comments. Earlier this year, Musk\u2019s company took down posts from the chatbot that appeared to praise Adolf Hitler after complaints about antisemitic content.",
      "The Paris prosecutor\u2019s office confirmed to The Associated Press on Friday that the Holocaust-denial comments have been added to an existing cybercrime investigation into X. The case was opened earlier this year after French officials raised concerns that the platform\u2019s algorithm could be used for foreign interference.",

      "Researchers have completed a full accounting of water uses and losses in the Rio Grande-Bravo basin as it faces severe shortages throughout its range in the United States and Mexico",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- One of North America's longest rivers, the Rio Grande \u2014 or Rio Bravo as it's called in Mexico \u2014 has a history as deep as it is long. Indigenous people have tapped it for countless generations, and it was a key artery for Spanish conquistadors centuries ago.",
      "Today, the Rio Grande-Bravo water basin is in crisis.",
      "Research published Thursday says the situation arguably is worse than challenges facing the Colorado River, another vital lifeline for western U.S. states that have yet to chart a course for how best to manage that dwindling resource.",
      "Without rapid and large-scale action on both sides of the border, the researchers warn that unsustainable use threatens water security for millions of people who rely on the binational basin. They say more prevalent drying along the Rio Grande and persistent shortages could have catastrophic consequences for farmers, cities and ecosystems.",
      "The study done by World Wildlife Fund, Sustainable Waters and a team of university researchers provides a full accounting of the consumptive uses as well as evaporation and other losses within the Rio Grande-Bravo basin. It helps to paint the most complete \u2014 and most alarming \u2014 picture yet of why the river system is in trouble.",
      "The basin provides drinking water to 15 million people in the U.S. and Mexico and irrigates nearly 2 million acres of cropland in the two countries.",
      "The research shows only 48% of the water consumed directly or indirectly within the basin is replenished naturally. The other 52% is unsustainable, meaning reservoirs, aquifers and the river itself will be overdrawn.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty daunting, challenging reality when half of our water isn\u2019t necessarily going to be reliable for the future,\" said Brian Richter, president of Sustainable Waters and a senior fellow with the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cSo we have to really address that.\"",
      "By breaking down the balance sheet, the researchers are hopeful policymakers and regulators can determine where water use can be reduced and how to balance supply with demand.",
      "Warnings of what was to come first cropped up in the late 19th century when irrigation in Colorado\u2019s San Luis Valley began to dry the snowmelt-fed river, resulting in diminished flows as far south as El Paso, Texas. Now, some stretches of the river run dry for months at a time. The Big Bend area and even Albuquerque have seen dry cracked mud replace the river more often in recent years.",
      "Irrigating crops by far is the largest direct use of water in the basin at 87%, according to the study. Meanwhile, losses to evaporation and uptake by vegetation along the river account for more than half of overall consumption in the basin, a factor that can't be dismissed as reservoir storage shrinks.",
      "The irrigation season has become shorter, with canals drying up as early as June in some cases, despite a growing season in the U.S. and Mexico that typically lasts through October.",
      "In central New Mexico, farmers got a boost with summer rains. However, farmers along the Texas portion of the Pecos River and in the Rio Conchos basin of Mexico \u2014 both tributaries within the basin \u2014 did not receive any surface water supplies.",
      "\u201cA key part of this is really connecting the urban populations to what\u2019s going on out on these farms. These farmers are really struggling. A lot of them are on the brink of bankruptcy,\" Richter said, linking water shortages to shrinking farms, smaller profits and less ability to afford labor and equipment.",

      "With fewer farms, less water went to irrigation in the U.S. However, researchers said irrigation in the Mexican portion of the basin has increased greatly.",
      "The World Wildlife Fund and Sustainable Waters are working with researchers at the University of New Mexico to survey farmers on solutions to the water crisis.",
      "Jason Casuga, the chief engineer and CEO of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, said he is not surprised by the findings and was particularly interested in the data on how much water is lost to riparian areas along the river. He talked about his crews clearing thick walls of thirsty invasive salt cedar trees, describing it as an unnatural ecosystem that stemmed from human efforts to manage the river with levees and reservoirs.",
      "While cities and farmers try to conserve, Casuga said there are few rules placed on consumption by riparian areas.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re willing to accept hundreds and hundreds of acres of invasive species choking out native species. And I'm hoping a study like this will cause people to think and ask those kinds of questions because I think our bosque is worth fighting for. As a culture in New Mexico, agriculture is worth fighting for,\u201d he said.",
      "The responses to overuse and depletion are as varied as the jurisdictions through which the river flows, said Enrique Prunes, a co-author of the study and the manager of the World Wildlife Fund's Rio Grande Program.",
      "He pointed to Colorado, where water managers have threatened to shut off groundwater wells if the aquifer that supports irrigated farms cannot be stabilized. There, farmers who pump groundwater pay fees that are used to incentivize other farmers to fallow their fields.",
      "New Mexico's fallowing program is voluntary, but changes could be in store if the U.S. Supreme Court signs off on proposed settlements stemming from a long-running dispute with Texas and the federal government over management of the Rio Grande and groundwater use. New Mexico has acknowledged it will have to curb groundwater pumping.",
      "New Mexico is behind in its water deliveries to Texas under an interstate compact, while Mexico owes water to the U.S. under a 1944 binational treaty. Researchers said meeting those obligations won't get easier.",
      "Prunes said policymakers must also consider the environment when crafting solutions.",
      "\u201cRebalancing the system also means maintaining those basic functions that the river and the aquifers and the groundwater-dependent ecosystems have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the indicator of resilience to a future of less water.\u201d",

      "Meta has started notifying young Australians to download their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram, and Threads",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Technology giant Meta on Thursday began sending thousands of young Australians a two-week warning to downland their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram and Threads before a world-first social media ban on accounts of children younger than 16 takes effect.",
      "The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10.",
      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cWe will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \u201cso we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\u201d",
      "Meta has estimated there are 350,000 Australians aged 13-to-15 on Instagram and 150,000 in that age bracket on Facebook. Australia\u2019s population is 28 million.",
      "Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a \u201cvideo selfie,\u201d Meta said.",
      "Terry Flew, co-director of Sydney University\u2019s Center for AI, Trust and Governance, said such facial-recognition technology had a failure rate of at least 5%.",
      "\u201cIn the absence of a government-mandated ID system, we\u2019re always looking at second-best solutions around these things,\u201d Flew told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children.",
      "Failure to take reasonable steps to exclude young children could earn platforms fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($32 million).",

      "\u201cThere are aspects of the legislation that we\u2019re not entirely supportive of, but the principle that children under the age of 16 are better off in the real world, that\u2019s something we advocated for and are in favor of,\u201d Elachi said.",
      "\u201cWhen everybody misses out, nobody misses out. That\u2019s the theory. Certainly we expect that it would play out that way. We hope parents are going to be very positive about this and try to help their children see all the potential possibilities that are now open to them,\u201d he added.",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.",
      "Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over \u2014 often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement\u2019s radar.",
      "Once limited to policing the nation\u2019s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country\u2019s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans\u2019 daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration\u2019s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.",
      "This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America\u2019s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers\u2019 behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency\u2019s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency\u2019s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.",
      "Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\u201d the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \u201cto operate anywhere in the United States,\u201d the agency added.",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol\u2019s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that \u201clarge-scale surveillance technology that\u2019s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\u201d might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America\u2019s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.",
      "\u201cThey are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know \u2026 engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,\u201d Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP\u2019s findings. \u201cThese surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\u201d",
      "In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina\u2019s low country.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck\u2019s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.",
      "But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.",
      "They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash \u2014 money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.",
      "Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paqueter\u00eda El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.",
      "\u201cWe did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,\u201d said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver\u2019s name and get the trailer out of impound.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: \u201cwhisper,\u201d \u201cintel\u201d or \u201cwall\u201d stops. Those stops are meant to conceal \u2014 or wall off \u2014 that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who\u2019s traveling on America\u2019s roads and predicting who is \u201csuspicious,\u201d according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.",
      "In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff\u2019s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.",
      "Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.",
      "At Border Patrol\u2019s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff\u2019s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.",
      "\u201cThe beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there\u2019s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,\u201d said Joel Babb, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who stopped Schott\u2019s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.",
      "According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott\u2019s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott\u2019s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.",
      "Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff\u2019s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.",
      "The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles\u2019 travel patterns \u2014 based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.",
      "In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. \u201cNeed BP?,\u201d responded a group member whose number was labeled \u201cbp Intel.\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens\u2019 social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.",
      "In Schott\u2019s case, Babb testified that federal agents \u201cactually watch travel patterns on the highway\u201d through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: \u201cI just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.\u201d",
      "After finding nothing in Schott\u2019s car, Babb said \u201cnine times out of 10, this is what happens,\u201d a phrase Schott\u2019s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff\u2019s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.",

      "The case is pending in federal court in Texas. Schott said in an interview with the AP: \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was illegal to drive in Texas.\"",
      "Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation\u2019s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.",
      "Border Patrol's parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers \u201dfor a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,\u201d the document states.",
      "But that\u2019s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major \u2014 and in some places permanent \u2014 fixture of the border region.",
      "In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, \u201ccollects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist \u2026 in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.\u201d Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.",
      "Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls \u201cpatterns of life\u201d of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining \u201cabnormal\u201d routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle\u2019s plates as well as its driver\u2019s face, the official said.",
      "Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field \u2014 develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.",
      "The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are \u201cread\u201d by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system's algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system\u2019s algorithm can flag an unusual \u201cpattern of life\u201d for human inspection.",
      "The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to \u201cDallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta\u201d before ending up south of San Antonio.",
      "Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.",
      "Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company \u201cfor now\u201d had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol\u2019s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.",
      "Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP\u2019s public records requests.",
      "CBP\u2019s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program\u2019s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas \u201cwould permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.\u201d Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.",
      "One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp\u2019s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.",
      "The Border Patrol\u2019s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.",
      "CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.",
      "Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.",
      "A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.",
      "In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol\u2019s to prioritize border security.",

      "In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a \u201ccovert, mobile, License Plate Reader\u201d to pipe data to Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff's department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency\u2019s surveillance network.",
      "How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol\u2019s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration\u2019s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.",
      "The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.",
      "\u201cWe took Alek\u2019s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,\u201d said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. \u201dWhat we found was something much larger \u2014 a system of mass surveillance that threatens people\u2019s freedom of movement.\u201d",
      "AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite \u201csuspicious\u201d travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged \u201cconducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns\u201d as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.",
      "In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase \u201csubsequent to prior knowledge\u201d when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.",
      "Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.",
      "Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.",
      "\u201cI assume for every one person like me, who\u2019s actually standing up, there\u2019s a thousand people who just don\u2019t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don\u2019t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,\u201d Schott said. \u201cI think there\u2019s thousands of people getting treated this way.\u201d",

      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual, I mean extremely unusual, to just complain of a problem with autobiographical memory,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cOne has to think about unusual disorders.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m reentering some real time of fun, joy,\u201d Morrill said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t shooting for that. I just wanted to be alive.\u201d",

      "Children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups are urging parents not to buy AI-powered toys during the holiday season",
      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for more than 10 years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAn AI toy collapses that work. It answers instantly, smoothly, and often better than a human would. We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agent\u2014but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",

      "GARDEN GROVE, Calif. -- An interactive museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin, which some say was Jesus\u2019 burial cloth, opens its doors to the public Wednesday at the Christ Cathedral campus in Southern California.",
      "\u201cThe Shroud of Turin: An Immersive Experience,\u201d a $5-million exhibit in Garden Grove featuring 360-degree projection room theaters, Shroud of Turin replicas, interactive kiosks, and a life-size sculpture of Christ, was conceived over a span of three years and funded through private donations.",
      "The content was created primarily by Othonia, Inc., a Rome-based group dedicated to the examination of the shroud, one of the most studied artifacts in history. The original \u2014 a 14-foot-long, 3.5-foot-wide (4.3-meter-long, 1 meter-wide) cloth \u2014 is kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case housed in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy.",
      "The California museum \u2014 covering 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) \u2014 contains a life-size laminated visual of the shroud stretched over a wall. It shows the faint image of a man with wounds similar to those of Christ.",
      "The Vatican has called the cloth a powerful symbol of Christ\u2019s suffering while making no claim to its authenticity. Many experts stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth that put it in the 13th or 14th century, but many faithful \u2014 some accomplished scientists among them \u2014 say the results might have been skewed by contamination, calling for larger samples to be analyzed. Many insist that the cloth contains pollen from Jerusalem and is woven in a pattern that was unique to the first century.",
      "The cloth, considered a relic by many Christians, was most recently on display in the spring of 2015. While the shroud may never leave Turin, the new exhibit will remain at least through 2030 on the Christ Cathedral campus, next to the famous glass tower and sanctuary erected by televangelist Robert H. Schuller that is now home to the Catholic Diocese of Orange.",
      "The Most Rev. Timothy Freyer, an auxiliary bishop at the diocese, said he hopes the exhibit will reinforce for visitors the power of God\u2019s love for all.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that people of faith will have stronger faith, people who are doubting will come to belief and people with no faith will begin the questioning process and then come to faith,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the highlights of the immersive experience is a re-creation of Christ\u2019s resurrection on Easter morning, with museum visitors sitting in the tomb and watching the shrouded body disappear in a flash of light. The exhibit also features replicas of the spear believed to have pierced Christ\u2019s chest and the helmet of thorns placed on his head.",
      "Philip Rizzo, a parishioner at St. Bonaventure Catholic Church in Huntington Beach who was part of a group that got a preview, said seeing these items up close created a powerful visual representation of Christ\u2019s suffering and sacrifice. Also, he said, witnessing the extensive scientific research conducted on the cloth makes the artifact more relatable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tangible beings, not just spirit and light,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cScience really helps make that connection.\u201d",
      "While some scientists have criticized the eagerness of Christians to authenticate the cloth, the new exhibit had its origins in such curiosity. Its main proponent was August Accetta, a gynecologist who opened up the Shroud Center of Southern California in 1998 and has studied the cloth's mystery for over three decades.",
      "Accetta said it was the Shroud of Turin that converted him from agnostic to Catholic. His Shroud fascination continued after meeting John Jackson, a nuclear physicist, who in 1978 led a 40-person team of scientists as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project. Their study determined that the cloth was not a manufactured work of art, but contained human bloodstains and that no known physical, chemical or biological process could adequately explain how the image on the Shroud was formed.",
      "Accetta believes, as some other scientists do, that the image was created by a burst of radiation and that a massive amount of energy is required to create the image without burning the cloth.",
      "\u201cOn the shroud, you see four centimeters of anatomically correct information encoded in two microns, which is about half the thickness of a strand of hair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t even begin to understand that, let alone reproduce it.\u201d",
      "To him, the only explanation \u2014 as the interactive exhibit illustrates \u2014 is that the body of Christ became light and the shroud simply collapsed, leaving the fine imprint of his face on the white linen.",

He built the first flagship exhibit in Jerusalem and others in Rome, Poland, Mexico and the U.S. This latest one is the first to feature an immersive experience, which was created by a California-based studio.",

      "HONG KONG -- The Dutch government said it\u2019s relinquishing control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, easing a standoff between China and the Netherlands that threatened supplies of semiconductors vital for global auto manufacturing.",
      "Economics Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans said Wednesday that he was suspending an earlier order to take control of Nexperia under a rarely invoked law.",
      "The Dutch government cited national security concerns and \u201cserious governance shortcomings\u201d when it took effective control of Nexperia, which is headquartered in the city of Nijmegen but owned by China\u2019s Wingtech Technology. Officials said they were trying to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe\u2019s economic security.",
      "Nexperia chips are widely used by carmakers in North America, Japan and South Korea. Automakers warned in recent weeks that they were running low on the chips, and Honda was forced to shut down a factory in Mexico producing its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets.",
      "Karremans said he was suspending his order issued in late September as a \u201cshow of goodwill\u201d in a decision that came after \u201cconstructive meetings\u201d with Chinese authorities over the past few days.",
      "\u201cIn light of recent developments, The Netherlands has considered it the right moment to take a constructive step by suspending my order under the Goods Availability Act,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world.\"",
      "The Netherlands issued its seizure order after the United States put Wingtech on its \u201centity list\u201d of companies that face export controls, and then expanded it in September to include subsidiaries including Nexperia.",

      "While both governments have made conciliatory gestures, there were signs of tension within the company in recent days. Nexperia\u2019s Chinese unit accused the Dutch headquarters last week of halting shipments of wafers used to make chips at its assembly center in China, which it said could affect its ability to deliver finished products.",

      "Beast Philanthropy, the charitable organization started by MrBeast founder Jimmy Donaldson, and the Rockefeller Foundation are announcing a strategic partnership",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the most storied American philanthropies is teaming up with the internet's biggest creator to instill young people with a concern for what they call the world's \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d populations.",
      "Beast Philanthropy, the charitable organization started by MrBeast founder Jimmy Donaldson, and the Rockefeller Foundation announced a strategic partnership Monday. The idea is to pair Donaldson's unique ability to capture youth attention spans with the foundation's 112-year history of using its resources and technology to tackle global problems.",
      "Speaking together ahead of a Nov. 21 video shoot at MrBeast's Greenville, North Carolina, studio, the partners complimented the respective strengths they hope to exchange with each other.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life making YouTube videos. They\u2019ve spent their entire lives helping people,\" Donaldson told The Associated Press. \"Obviously, they have a team who\u2019s way more experienced than me in helping people, but being able to pull on their knowledge and wisdom is amazing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just want to download their brains into our team\u2019s brains,\" he added.",
      "Dr. Rajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said the philanthropic sector has long failed to capture \u201cthe hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of young people.\u201d He said MrBeast can help them engage young people, inspire hope and communicate their work more accessibly.",
      "Most people have a natural desire to help others, according to Shah, but we teach ourselves that world problems are \u201ctoo big and too complicated\u201d to solve. He pointed to MrBeast's video in Zambia, where they provided a village with solar-powered electricity and clean water wells.",
      "\"What Jimmy\u2019s already done is show that you can change that dramatically,\u201d Shah said. \"If we can get people believing that they can make a difference through this collaboration, we will have achieved something really unique and really special.\u201d",
      "The move signals Donaldson's continued attempts to evolve an organization with sprawling interests that include an entertainment studio, food brands, his own James Patterson book deal and, most recently, a limited time theme park in Saudi Arabia. He brought on venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold as CEO last year and then hired more new executives as a series of controversies threatened his ambitions ahead of his Amazon Prime reality game show 's release.",
      "It's an unlikely marriage to some. The Rockefeller Foundation is a pillar of civil society established with wealth amassed by the 19th-century oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller during the Gilded Age whereas the 27-year-old Donaldson represents the 21st century \u201cinfluencer\u201d economy where entire media empires can emerge from content creators' viral stunts and the online buzz they generate.",
      "Shah acknowledged that the Rockefeller Foundation rarely does corporate partnerships. But he said that spending time with Donaldson and his mother, as well as watching his philanthropically minded videos, communicated the YouTube megastar's \u201cpersonal commitment to philanthropy\u201d and the \u201csense of enthusiasm one can experience when you help others.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe bring innovation, a sense of purpose and a deep commitment to measuring results to those efforts. And, over time, it\u2019s literally helped hundreds of millions of people escape poverty, hunger and disease,\" Shah said. \u201cI just think Jimmy, and the enterprise he\u2019s built and the perspective that he brings, is totally consistent with that.\u201d",
      "The exact issues they plan to tackle together are still being hammered out and there is no shared grantmaking to announce yet. But Shah mentioned that the Rockefeller Foundation has a long history of combatting child hunger and noted Beast Philanthropy\u2019s video on a school meal program.",
      "Already, though, they have started working to combat child labor in the cocoa industry.",
      "Through his snack company, Feastables, Donaldson says he wants to prove that chocolate can be profitable without using child labor on cacao farms. He hopes to provide farmers with living incomes, create stable economic conditions so children can go to school instead of farms and use his YouTube channel to rally consumers around fair-trade practices.",
      "The Rockefeller Foundation has consulted MrBeast on \u201chow they should go about the case study,\u201d according to Donaldson. To that end, the two organizations say they will visit Ghana early next year to \u201clearn from one another's work in development, community-led change, and global storytelling.\u201d",
      "Donaldson said he wants to use his influence to inspire youth to \u201cdo good and volunteer and donate and care about these projects.\u201d But he hopes the Rockefeller Foundation can help him be more efficient and make \u201creal, lasting change.\u201d He said it doesn't make sense for him to \u201cgo make the same mistakes they've made a bajillion times\u201d",

      "BUTNER, N.C. -- H. Rap Brown, one of the most vocal leaders of the Black Power movement, has died in a prison hospital while serving a life sentence for the killing of a Georgia sheriff\u2019s deputy. He was 82.",
      "Brown died Sunday at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina, his widow Karima Al-Amin said Monday.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately available, but Karima Al-Amin told The Associated Press that her husband had been suffering from cancer and had been transferred to the medical facility in 2014 from a federal prison in Colorado.",
      "Like other more militant Black leaders and organizers during the racial upheaval of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Brown decried heavy-handed policing in Black communities. He once stated that violence was \u201cas American as cherry pie.\u201d",
      "\u201cViolence is a part of America\u2019s culture,\u201d Brown said during a 1967 news conference. \u201c... America taught the black people to be violent. We will use that violence to rid ourselves of oppression, if necessary. We will be free by any means necessary.\u201d",
      "Brown was chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a powerful civil rights group, and in 1968 was named minister of justice for the Black Panther Party.",
      "Three years later, he was arrested for a robbery that ended in a shootout with New York police.",
      "While serving a five-year prison sentence for the robbery, Brown converted to the Dar-ul Islam movement and changed his name to Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin. Upon his release, he moved to Atlanta in 1976, opened a grocery and health food store and became an Imam, a spiritual leader for local Muslims.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not dissatisfied with what I did,\u201d Al-Amin told an audience in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1998. \u201cBut Islam has allowed things to be clearer. ... We have to be concerned about the welfare of ourselves and those around us, and that comes through submission to God and the raising of one\u2019s consciousness.\u201d",

      "English testified at trial that Al-Amin fired a high-powered assault rifle when the deputies tried to arrest him. Then, prosecutors said, he used a handgun to fire three shots into Kinchen\u2019s groin as the wounded deputy lay in the street. Kinchen would die from his wounds.",
      "Prosecutors portrayed Al-Amin as a deliberate killer, while his lawyers painted him as a peaceful community and religious leader who helped revitalize poverty-stricken areas. They suggested he was framed as part of a government conspiracy dating from his militant days.",
      "Al-Amin maintained his innocence but was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to life.",
      "He argued that his constitutional rights were violated at trial and in 2019 challenged his imprisonment before a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case.",

      "A task force ordered by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has made thousands of arrests",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A task force ordered by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has made thousands of arrests, compounding strains on the busy local court system and an already overcrowded jail in ways that concerned officials say will last months or even years as cases play out.",
      "Since late September, hundreds of federal, state and local law enforcement personnel tied to the Memphis Safe Task Force have made traffic stops, served warrants and searched for fugitives in the city of about 610,000 people. More than 2,800 people have been arrested and more than 28,000 traffic citations have been issued, data provided by the task force and Memphis police shows.",
      "The task force, which includes National Guard troops, is supported by Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others who hope the surge reduces crime in a city that has grappled with violent crime, including nearly 300 homicides last year and nearly 400 in 2023.",
      "From 2018 to 2024, homicides in Memphis increased 33% and aggravated assaults rose 41%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crimes across the country using local law enforcement data for its Real-Time Crime Index. But AH Datalytics reported those numbers were down 20% during the first nine months of this year, even before the task force got to work.",
      "Opponents of the task force in majority-Black Memphis say it targets minorities and intimidates law-abiding Latinos, some of whom have skipped work and changed social habits, such as avoiding going to church or restaurants, fearing they will be harassed and unfairly detained. Statistics released at the end of October showed 319 arrests so far on administrative warrants, which deal with immigration-related issues.",
      "The effects have rippled beyond the streets, into the aging criminal courthouse and the troubled jail. Officials are concerned about long waits in traffic court causing people to miss work and packed criminal court dockets forcing inmates to spend extra days waiting for bail hearings.",
      "\u201cThe human cost of it is astounding,\" said Josh Spickler, executive director for Just City, a Memphis-based organization that advocates for fairness in the criminal justice system.",
      "The mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, has requested more judges to hear cases that could span months or years. County officials are discussing opening court at night and on weekends, a move that would help manage the caseload but cost more.",
      "Meanwhile, Shelby County Jail inmates are being moved to other facilities because of overcrowding, officials say. Inmates at jail intake are sleeping in chairs, and jail officials are asking county commissioners for funding to help address problems, such as a corrections employees shortage.",
      "These issues raise concerns from activists and officials about safety in a jail that has seen 65 deaths since 2019, according to Just City. Court case backlogs mean defendants and crime victims could spend an unfair amount of time dealing with the criminal justice system, said Steve Mulroy, the county's district attorney.",
      "\u201cThe task force deployment probably could have used more planning,\u201d said Mulroy, a Democrat whose office is cooperating with the task force. \u201cMore thought could have been put into the downstream effects of the increased arrest numbers.\u201d",
      "There were hundreds more jail bookings and bail settings during the first several weeks of the task force\u2019s operation than during the comparable period last year, an increase of about 40% in each category, according to county statistics.",
      "The jail, which has a regular capacity of 2,400, had an average daily population of 3,195 inmates in September, the most recent month when statistics were available. County officials said that number was expected to rise for October.",
      "As of mid-November, 250 overflow jail detainees were being housed at other facilities, compared with 80 in November 2024. Some of those are outside Shelby County, which makes it harder for lawyers and relatives to visit and increases the cost of bringing defendants to Memphis for hearings.",
      "In a letter to commissioners, Chief Jailer Kirk Fields has requested at least $1.5 million in emergency funds, noting that more inmates means more expenses for food, clothing, bedding and linens.",
      "One issue is whether there are enough judges to hear cases, especially after lawmakers eliminated two judgeships during last year's session.",

      "She was 7 years old when the two-day attack began on Tulsa\u2019s Greenwood district on May 31, 1921, after a local newspaper published a sensationalized report about a Black man accused of assaulting a white woman. As a white mob grew outside the courthouse, Black Tulsans with guns who hoped to prevent the man\u2019s lynching began showing up. White residents responded with overwhelming force. Hundreds of people were killed and homes were burned and looted, leaving over 30 city blocks decimated in the prosperous community known as Black Wall Street.",

      "As her family left in a horse-drawn buggy, her eyes burned from the smoke and ash, she wrote. She described seeing piles of bodies in the streets and watching as a white man shot a Black man in the head, then fired toward her family.",
      "She told The Associated Press in an interview the year her memoir was published that fear of reprisals influenced her years of near-silence about the massacre. She wrote the book with Howard, her grandson, who said he had to persuade her to tell her story.",

      "Fletcher, who in 2021 testified before Congress about what she went through, joined her younger brother, Hughes Van Ellis, and another massacre survivor, Lessie Benningfield Randle, in a lawsuit seeking reparations.

      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said he is sending an extra $220 million in state aid to SEPTA to help it comply with the orders. SEPTA said that, starting Monday, some of the 225 Silverliner IV cars will return to service for the first time since October.",
      "All five fires forced everyone aboard to evacuate \u2014 in one case, as many as 350 passengers \u2014 with a few minor injuries reported. One railcar was involved in two of the fires, and two other railcars were destroyed, the National Transportation Safety Board has said.",

      "Late Sunday, her mother Vilma P\u00e9rez and other relatives received her body at the capital\u2019s international airport and planned to transport it to her hometown of Cabrican, some 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of Guatemala City.",
      "Prosecutors charged Curt Andersen of Whitestown last week with voluntary manslaughter in connection with her death. Andersen\u2019s trial was scheduled to begin March 30, according to online court records. On Friday, a judge set bail at $25,000 and ordered him to surrender his passport.",
      "According to court documents, R\u00edos and her husband were part of a house cleaning crew and went to Andersen\u2019s house by mistake. As they tried to unlock Andersen\u2019s door with a key their company had given them, Andersen fired a shot through the door without warning. The bullet hit Rios in the head. Her husband was not hurt.",
      "Andersen told investigators he heard someone trying to unlock his front door and thought someone was trying to break into his home.",
      "Over the weekend, women in Cabrican cooked food in preparation for friends and relatives who would attend the wake and burial. At her parents\u2019 home, flowers and pictures of R\u00edos adorned an altar. Cabrican sits in a valley where most residents are Mam, an Indigenous Mayan people.",

      "Bird flu and another disease have shrunk the U.S. turkey population to a 40-year low this year",
      "CHELSEA, Mich. -- Old Brick Farm, where Larry Doll raises chickens, turkeys and ducks, was fortunate this Thanksgiving season.",
      "Doll's small farm west of Detroit had no cases of bird flu, despite an ongoing outbreak that killed more than 2 million U.S. turkeys in the last three months alone. He also avoided another disease, avian metapneumovirus, which causes turkeys to lay fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cI try to keep the operation as clean as possible, and not bringing other animals in from other farms helps mitigate that risk as well,\u201d said Doll, whose farm has been in his family for five generations.",
      "But Doll still saw the impact as those diseases shrank the U.S. turkey flock to a 40-year low this year. The hatchery where he gets his turkey chicks had fewer available this year. He plans to order another 100 hatchlings soon, even though they won\u2019t arrive until July.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get your order in early, you\u2019re not going to get it,\u201d he said.",
      "The shrinking population is expected to cause wholesale turkey prices to rise 44% this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the increase, many stores are offering discounted or even free turkeys to soften the potential blow to Thanksgiving meal budgets. But even if the bird is cheaper than last year, the ingredients to prepare the rest of the holiday feast may not be. Tariffs on imported steel, for example, have increased prices for canned goods.",
      "As of Nov. 17, a basket of 11 Thanksgiving staples \u2014 including a 10-pound frozen turkey, 10 Russet potatoes, a box of stuffing and cans of corn, green beans and cranberry sauce \u2013 cost $58.81, or 4.1% more than last year, according to Datasembly, a market research company that surveys weekly prices at 150,000 U.S. stores. That\u2019s higher than the average price increase for food eaten at home, which rose 2.7% in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Datasembly showed a 2% decline in the retail price of a 10-pound turkey as of Nov. 17. Pricing out Thanksgiving meals isn\u2019t an exact science, and the firm's tally differed from other estimates.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation, which uses volunteer shoppers in all 50 states to survey prices, reported that Thanksgiving dinner for 10 would cost $55.16 this year, or 5% less than last year. The Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, using NielsenIQ data from September, estimated that feeding 10 people on Thursday using store-brand products would cost $80 this year, which is 2% to 3% lower than last year's estimate.",
      "Grocery chains are also offering deals to attract shoppers. Discount grocer Aldi is advertising a $40 meal for 10 with 21 items. Kroger said shoppers could feed 10 people for under $50 with its menu of store-brand products.",
      "Earlier this month, President Donald Trump touted Walmart\u2019s Thanksgiving meal basket, which he said was 25% cheaper than last year. But that was because Walmart included a different assortment and fewer products overall this year.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing some promotions being implemented in an effort to draw customers into the store,\u201d David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University, said.",
      "That's despite a sharp increase in wholesale turkey prices since August. In the second week of November, frozen 8-16 pound hens were averaging $1.77 per pound, up 81% from the same period last year, according to Mark Jordan, the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, which closely follows the poultry and livestock markets.",

Turkey prices are also up at his local H-E-B supermarket, he said, but not by as much.",

      "Trump\u2019s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum are also raising prices. Farok Contractor, a distinguished professor of management and global business at the Rutgers Business School, said customers are paying 10 cents to 40 cents more per can when companies pass on the full cost of tariffs.",
      "Tariffs may be partly to blame for the increased cost of jellied cranberry sauce, which was up 38% from last year in Datasembly\u2019s survey. But weather was also a factor. U.S. cranberry production is expected to be down 9% this year, hurt by drought conditions in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "In Illinois, where most of the country\u2019s canning pumpkins are grown, dry weather actually helped pumpkins avoid diseases that are more prevalent in wet conditions, said Raghela Scavuzzo, an associate director of food systems development at the Illinois Farm Bureau and the executive director of the Illinois Specialty Growers Association. Datasembly found that a 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix cost 5% less than last year.",

      "Doll sold all 92 turkeys he raised this year, with customers paying $6.50 per pound for what many tell him is the best turkey they've ever tasted. He enjoys a little profit, he said, and the good feeling of supplying a holiday meal.",

      "Trump has signed legislation compelling the Justice Department to release the files on Jeffrey Epstein",
      "For Marina Lacerda, the upcoming publication of U.S. government files on Jeffrey Epstein represent more than an opportunity for justice: Lacerda says she was just 14 when Epstein started sexually abusing her at his New York mansion, but she struggles to recall much of what happened because it is such a dark period in her life.",
      "Now, she\u2019s hoping that the files will reveal more about the trauma that distorted so much of her adolescence.",
      "\u201cI feel that the government and the FBI knows more than I do, and that scares me, because it\u2019s my life, it\u2019s my past,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "President Donald Trump signed legislation Wednesday that will force the Justice Department to release documents from its voluminous files on Epstein.",
      "\u201cWe have waited long enough. We\u2019ve fought long enough,\u201d Lacerda said.",
      "It isn't clear yet how much new information will be in the files, gathered over two decades of investigations into Epstein's alleged sexual abuse of many girls and women.",
      "Some of his accusers expect the files to provide a level of transparency they had hardly allowed themselves to believe would materialize, but the release of the documents will be a more complicated moment for others.",
      "The FBI and police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein in the mid-2000s after several underage girls said he had paid them for sex acts. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges including procuring a minor for prostitution, but a secret deal with the U.S. attorney in Florida allowed him to avoid a federal prosecution. He served little more than a year in custody.",
      "Jena-Lisa Jones says she was abused by Epstein in Palm Beach, in 2002, when she was 14. She did not report the abuse to the police at the time, but she later became one of many accusers to sue the multimillionaire.",
      "The Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein in 2018 that exposed new details about how the federal prosecution was shelved. A year later, federal prosecutors in New York, where Epstein owned a mansion, revived the case and charged him with sex-trafficking",
      "Jones said she was interviewed during that federal investigation and was prepared to testify in court.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for me to have my moment, for him to see my face and hear my words, and me have that control and power back,\u201d Jones said.",
      "But that day never came.",
      "Epstein killed himself in a federal jail cell in New York City in August 2019.",
      "In lieu of her day in court, Jones and others are hoping for a public reckoning with the publication of the government files on Epstein.",
      "While the government only ever charged two people \u2014 Epstein and his longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell \u2014 in connection with the alleged abuse, at least one of Epstein's accusers has claimed she was instructed to have sex with other rich and powerful men.",
      "Jones didn't make similar claims but said she believes the documents could map out a \u201cbroad scheme\u201d involving others.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping they\u2019re shaking a little bit and that they have what\u2019s coming for them,\u201d Jones said.",

      "An immigrant from Brazil, Lacerda said she was working three jobs to support herself and her family the summer before 9th grade when a friend said she could make $300 if she gave Epstein massages.",
      "The first time she massaged Epstein, he told her to remove her shirt, she said.",
      "Lacerda said she was soon spending so much time working for Epstein that she dropped out of school. The sexual abuse persisted until she turned 17, when Epstein informed her that she was \u201ctoo old,\u201d she said.",
      "Lacerda wondered whether the files might include videos and photographs of her and other victims at Epstein\u2019s properties.",
      "\u201cI need to know \u2014 for my healing process and for the adult in me \u2014 what I did as a child,\u201d Lacerda said. \u201cIt will be re-traumatizing, but it\u2019s transparency \u2014 and I need it,\u201d she said.",
      "For Lacerda, the elation around the upcoming release of the files gave way to familiar feelings for many women who survive abuse: fear and paranoia.",

      "The abrupt change in the political momentum made her uneasy. She wondered if the documents would be doctored or redacted to protect people connected to Epstein.",
      "Others echoed her concerns, and wondered if the government would sufficiently protect victims who have remained anonymous, who fear scrutiny and harassment if their names were to become public.",
      "\u201cFor the rest of my life, I will never truly trust the government because of what they\u2019ve done to us,\u201d Jones said.",

      "She said the political maneuvering in recent months about the files led to non-stop anxiety \u2014 reminiscent of how she felt when she was abused as a teenager.",
      "\u201cI guess it really comes from the trauma I\u2019ve endured, because this is kind of what Jeffrey Epstein did to us. You know, he wasn\u2019t transparent. He played these manipulation tactics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s triggering for anybody who\u2019s been in that situation.\u201d",
      "Still, Robson said she is trying to enjoy the victory while she can.",

      "Christmas went on the auction block this week in Pennsylvania farm country in the form of a giant Christmas tree sale",
      "MIFFLINBURG, Pa. -- Christmas went on the auction block this week in Pennsylvania farm country, and there was no shortage of bidders.",
      "About 50,000 Christmas trees and enough wreaths, crafts and other seasonal items to fill an airplane hangar were bought and sold by lots and on consignment at the annual two-day event put on at the Buffalo Valley Produce Auction in Mifflinburg.",
      "Buyers from across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic were there to supply garden stores, corner lots and other retail outlets for the coming rush of customers eager to bring home a tree \u2014 most commonly a Fraser fir \u2014 or to deck the halls with miles of greenery.",
      "Bundled-up buyers were out in chilly temperatures to hear auctioneers hawk boxes of ornaments, bunches of winterberry, cotton branches, icicle lights, grave blankets, red bows and tree stands. It was nearly everything you would need for Christmas except the food and the presents.",
      "Americans\u2019 Christmas tree buying habits have been evolving for many years. These days homes are less likely than in years past to have a tree at all, and those that do have trees are more likely to opt for an artificial tree over the natural type, said Marsha Gray with the Howell, Michigan-based Real Christmas Tree Board, a national trade group of Christmas tree farmers.",
      "Cory Stephens was back for a second year at the auction after his customers raved about the holiday decor he purchased there last year for A.A. Co. Farm, Lawn & Garden, his store a three-hour drive away in Pasadena, Maryland. He spent nearly $5,000 on Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt's incredible, it's changed our whole world,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cIf you know what you're looking for, it's very hard to beat the quality.\u201d",
      "Ryan Marshall spent about $8,000 on various decorations for resale at Ward's Berry Farm in Sharon, Massachusetts. Among his purchases were three skids of wreaths at $29 per wreath \u2014 and he expected to double his money.",

      "An August survey by the Real Christmas Tree Board found that 84% of growers did not expect wholesale prices to increase this season.",

      "President Donald Trump is resurfacing his argument that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy doesn\u2019t \u201chave the cards\u201d to continue on the battlefield",
      "WASHINGTON -- With his new 28-point plan to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump is resurfacing his argument that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy doesn't \u201chave the cards\u201d to continue on the battlefield and must come to a settlement that heavily tilts in Moscow's favor.",
      "Trump, who has demonstrated low regard for Zelenskyy dating back to his first term, said Friday he expects the Ukrainian leader to respond to his administration's new plan to end the war by next Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe think we have a way of getting peace,\u201d Trump told reporters in an Oval Office appearance. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to approve it.\u201d",
      "Buffeted by a corruption scandal in his government, battlefield setbacks and another difficult winter looming as Russia continues to bombard Ukraine's energy grid, Zelenskyy says Ukraine is now facing perhaps the most difficult choice in its history.",
      "Zelenskyy has not spoken with Trump since the plan became public this week, but has said he expects to talk to the Republican president in coming days. It's likely to be another in a series of tough conversations the two leaders have had over the years.",
      "The first time they spoke, in 2019, Trump tried to pressure the then newly minted Ukrainian leader to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. That phone call sparked Trump's first impeachment.",
      "Trump made Biden's support for Ukraine a central issue in his successful 2024 campaign, saying the conflict had cost U.S. taxpayers too much money and vowing he would quickly bring the war to an end.",
      "Then early this year in a disastrous Oval Office meeting, Trump and Vice President JD Vance tore into Zelenskyy for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the more than $180 billion the U.S. had appropriated for military aid and other assistance to Kyiv since the start of the war. That episode led to a temporary suspension of U.S. assistance to Ukraine.",
      "And now with the new proposal, Trump is pressing Zelenskyy to agree to concessions of land to Moscow, a massive reduction in the size of Ukraine\u2019s army, and agreement from Europe to assert that Ukraine will never be admitted into the NATO military alliance.",
      "\u201cNow Ukraine may find itself facing a very difficult choice: either loss of dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a video address Friday.",
      "At the center of Trump's plan is the call on Ukraine to concede the entirety of its eastern Donbas region, even though a vast swath of that land remains in Ukrainian control. Analysts at the independent Institute for the Study of War have estimated it would take several years for the Russian military to completely seize the territory, based on its current rate of advances.",
      "Trump, nevertheless, insists that the loss of the region \u2014 which includes cities that are vital defense, industrial and logistics hubs for Ukrainian forces \u2014 is a fait accompli.",
      "\u201cThey will lose in a short period of time. You know so,\u201d Trump said Friday when asked during a Fox News Radio interview about his push on Ukraine to give up the territory. \u201cThey\u2019re losing land. They\u2019re losing land.\u201d",
      "The Trump proposal was formally presented to Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Thursday by Dan Driscoll, the U.S. Army secretary. The plan itself was a surprise to Driscoll\u2019s staffers, who were not aware as late as Wednesday that their boss would be going to Ukraine as part of a team to present the plan to the Ukrainians.",
      "Army officials walked away from that meeting with the impression that the Ukrainians were viewing the proposal as a starting point that would evolve as negotiations progressed, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks.",
      "It's unclear how much patience Trump has for further negotiation. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that Trump's new plan reflects \u201cthe realities of the situation\u201d and offers the \u201cbest win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\u201d",

In fact, in Ukraine\u2019s last parliamentary election in 2019, support for far-right candidates was 2%, significantly lower than in many other European countries.",
      "The plan's provision is \u201cvery clearly an attempt to build up Putin's claim to Russian cultural identity within Ukraine,\u201d Silbey said.

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Since it was created in 2018, the federal government's cybersecurity agency has helped warn state and local election officials about potential threats from foreign governments, showed officials how to protect polling places from attacks and gamed out how to respond to the unexpected, such as an Election Day bomb threat or sudden disinformation campaign",

      "Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has announced she will resign from Congress on January 5, 2026",
      "ATLANTA -- It all happened so fast. Less than a week after President Donald Trump denounced Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican announced that she would resign from Congress on Jan. 5.",
      "Greene's departure will cap five tumultuous years in Congress. She was first an outsider, then briefly at the center of power during House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reign. Trump's return to the White House could have heralded a new era of clout in Washington, but Greene's simmering discontent led to a split with the president.",
      "Here's a look at Greene's background and some of the most notable episodes in her tumultuous five-year career in Congress.",
      "Greene had little involvement in politics before Trump ran for president. She and her husband had bought a commercial contracting company from Greene's father. Greene later opened a CrossFit gym in suburban Atlanta. But during the 2016 campaign, she started posting stories and videos online.",
      "Her initial commentary was a stew of conspiracy theories. Greene suggested a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was a coordinated attack to spur support for new gun restrictions. In 2018, she endorsed the idea that the U.S. government perpetrated the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. In a video filmed at the U.S. Capitol in 2018, she claimed Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., both Muslim women, weren\u2019t \u201cofficial\u201d members of Congress because they used Qurans rather than Bibles in their swearing-in ceremonies.",
      "In 2020, Greene jumped into politics by joining a crowded Republican primary in a competitive congressional district in suburban Atlanta, where she lived. But after the incumbent in northwest Georgia's strongly Republican 14th District announced his retirement, Greene shifted her candidacy there.",
      "During her campaign, Greene openly sympathized with QAnon, a conspiracy theory involving a global cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals, including U.S. government leaders, that operates a child sex trafficking ring. She eventually distanced herself, saying she got \u201csucked into some of the things I had seen on the internet.\u201d",

      "In the mid-20th century, comic books groups grew in popularity",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- On a recent day at Sacramento native Lecho Lopez's comic shop in the city, his 5-year-old nephew read his first word aloud: \u201cbad.\u201d It was from a graphic novel.",
      "There was irony in that being his first word, because Lopez credits comic books with many positive things in his life. That's why he supports repealing a city ordinance dating back to 1949 that bars the distribution of many comic books to kids and teens. It's not enforced today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a silly law,\u201d said Lopez, who has a red-and-black tattoo of the Superman logo on his forearm, in an interview at his store, JLA Comics. \u201cA lot of good things come out of comic books.\"",
      "A City Council committee unanimously voted this week to advance the repeal and designate the third week of September as \u201cSacramento Comic Book Week.\u201d It now heads to the full council for a vote. The ban applies to comic books prominently featuring an account of crime that show images of illegal acts such as arson, murder or rape.",
      "In the mid-20th century, as comic books were on the rise, fears spread over their impact on children, with some arguing they could lead to illiteracy or inspire violent crime. The industry decided to regulate itself, and local governments \u2014 from Los Angeles County to Lafayette, Louisiana \u2014 passed bans to shield certain comics from young people. While some cities like Sacramento still have those laws on the books, they are rarely if ever enforced.",
      "Now, proponents of repealing the Sacramento law say it\u2019s necessary to reflect the value of comics and help protect against a modern wave of book bans.",
      "Comic book author Eben Burgoon, who started a petition to overturn Sacramento's ban, said comics \u201chave this really valuable ability to speak truth to power.\u201d",
      "\"These antiquated laws kind of set up this jeopardy where bad actors could work hard to make this medium imperiled,\u201d he said at a hearing Tuesday held by the city council\u2019s Law and Legislation Committee.",
      "Sacramento is a great place to devote a week to celebrating comics, Burgoon said. The city has a \u201cwonderful\u201d comic book community, he said, and hosts CrockerCon, a comics showcase at a local art museum, every year.",
      "Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, said \u201cthere is no good reason\u201d to have a ban such as Sacramento's on the books, saying it \u201cflies in the face of modern First Amendment norms.\u201d",
      "The movement to censor comics decades ago was not an aberration in U.S. history, said Jeff Trexler, interim director of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, which fights to protect the free-speech rights of people who read or make comics.",
      "New York, for example, created a commission in the 1920s dedicated to reviewing films to determine whether they should be licensed for public viewing, based on whether they were \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201csacrilegious\u201d and could \u201ccorrupt morals\u201d or \u201cincite crime,\" according to the state archives.",

      "The California Supreme Court ruled in 1959 that a Los Angeles County policy banning the sale of so-called \u201ccrime\u201d comic books to minors was unconstitutional because it was too broad. Sacramento's ban probably doesn't pass muster for the same reason, Trexler said.",
      "There\u2019s not a lot of recent research on whether there\u2019s a link between comic books and violent behavior, said Christopher Ferguson, a professor of psychology at Stetson University in Florida. But, he said, similar research into television and video games has not shown a link to \u201cclinically relevant changes in youth aggression or violent behavior.\u201d",
      "Leafing through comics like EC Comics' \u201cEpitaphs from the Abyss\" and DC's and Marvel's collaboration \"Batman/Deadpool,\" Lopez showed an Associated Press reporter images of characters smashing the windshield of a car, smacking someone across the face and attacking Batman using bows and arrows \u2014 the kinds of scenes that might be regulated if Sacramento's ban were enforced.",
      "But comics with plot lines that include violence can contain positive messages, said Benjamin Morse, a media studies lecturer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cSpider-Man is a very mature concept,\" said Morse, who became an \u201cX-Men\u201d fan as a kid and later worked at Marvel for 10 years. \"It\u2019s a kid who\u2019s lost his parents, his uncle dies to violence and he vows to basically be responsible.\u201d",
      "Lopez's mother bought him his first comic book, \u201cUltimate Spider-Man #1,\u201d when he was around 9 years old, he said. But it was \u201cKingdom Come,\u201d a comic featuring DC's Justice League, that changed his life at a young age, with its \u201chyper-realistic\u201d art that looked like nothing he'd ever seen before, he said.",

      "\u201cThe only thing that I was really able to read that helped me absorb the information was comic books because you had a visual aid to help you explain what was going on in the book,\" Lopez said.",
      "And a comic book can offer so much more, Burgoon said at this week\u2019s hearing.",
      "\u201cIt makes imaginative thinkers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not make widespread delinquency. It does not make societal harm.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration is promoting efforts to work with Nigeria's government to counter violence against Christians, signaling a broader strategy since he ordered preparations for possible military action and warned that the United States could go in \u201cguns-a-blazing\u201d to wipe out Islamic militants.",
      "A State Department official said this past week that plans involve much more than just the potential use of military force, describing an expansive approach that includes diplomatic tools, such as potential sanctions, but also assistance programs and intelligence sharing with the Nigerian government.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also met with Nigeria\u2019s national security adviser to discuss ways to stop the violence, posting photos on social media of the two of them shaking hands and smiling. It contrasted with Trump\u2019s threats this month to stop all assistance to Nigeria if its government \u201ccontinues to allow the killing of Christians.\u201d",
      "The efforts may support Trump\u2019s pledge to avoid more involvement in foreign conflicts and come as the U.S. security footprint has diminished in Africa, where military partnerships have either been scaled down or canceled. American forces likely would have to be drawn from other parts of the world for any military intervention in Nigeria.",

      "Jonathan Pratt, who leads the State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, told lawmakers Thursday that \u201cpossible Department of War engagement\u201d is part of the larger plan, while the issue has been discussed by the National Security Council, an arm of the White House that advises the president on national security and foreign policy.",
      "But Pratt described a wide-ranging approach at a congressional hearing about Trump\u2019s recent designation of Nigeria as \u201ca country of particular concern\u201d over religious freedom, which opens the door for sanctions.",

      "The violence in Nigeria is far more complex than Trump has portrayed, with militant Islamist groups like Boko Haram killing both Christians and Muslims. At the same time, mainly Muslim herders and mostly Christian farmers have been fighting over land and water. Armed bandits who are motivated more by money than religion also are carrying out abductions for ransom, with schools being a popular target.",

      "Federal prosecutors say Luigi Mangione\u2019s death penalty case in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson should carry on unimpeded",
      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said Friday that Luigi Mangione\u2019s death penalty case in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson should carry on unimpeded, urging a judge to reject a defense push to dismiss charges and rule out capital punishment over Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s public statements suggesting Mangione deserves execution.",
      "The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan also asked U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to deny the defense\u2019s bid to suppress certain evidence collected during the arrest last year, including a 9 mm handgun, a notebook in which authorities say Mangione described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d an insurance executive and statements he made to police.",
      "\u201cPretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect,\" prosecutors wrote in a 121-page court filing, citing prior rulings from the Supreme Court and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "As for the evidence, which Mangione\u2019s lawyers contend was collected without a warrant and without him being read his rights, prosecutors said police officers were justified in searching the suspect\u2019s backpack to make sure there were no dangerous items. His statements to officers, they said, were made voluntarily and before he was taken into police custody.",
      "Rather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense\u2019s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione\u2019s rights are respected at trial.",
      "\u201cWhat the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments\u201d rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. \u201cNone warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.\u201d",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges.",
      "In September a judge threw out state terrorism charges against him but kept the rest of that case \u2014 including an intentional murder charge \u2014 in place. He is due back in court in the state case Dec. 1 as his lawyers seek to bar prosecutors from using much of the same evidence seized upon his arrest.",
      "Mangione's next court date in the federal case is Jan. 9.",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for his company\u2019s annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.",

      "Bondi\u2019s statements and other official actions \u2014 including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration\u2019s flouting of established death penalty procedures \u2014 \u201chave violated Mr. Mangione\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,\u201d his lawyers said.",
      "Trump, who oversaw an unprecedented run of 13 executions at the end of his first term, has also offered opinions about Mangione despite court rules against any pretrial publicity that could interfere with the right to a fair trial.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 08:51:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Jimmy Cliff, who famously sang about the \"many rivers\" we all must cross, has died after suffering a seizure and pneumonia, his family say.",
    "story": [
      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

    "story": [
      "In 1965, the original musical \"Funny Girl\" was playing at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre, starring someone who knew her way around a song. That same year, a guy named Joe Allen opened a place a few blocks away. It was the place to be for Broadway stars like Al Pacino and a host of others. Plus, they served a mean cheeseburger.",
      "The cheeseburgers are still there, and so are Broadway's elite. Lea Michele has been coming here since her Broadway debut in the 1990s. \"I just love this place so much,\" she said.",
      "And what would she eat? \"A burger. I mean, it's always so good, so good here, oh my God,\" she said.",
      "But when we met her at Joe Allen's, she wasn't in a burger mood, because she had a show to do. Lea Michele is currently starring in the musical \"Chess.\" In the show, she plays a brilliant strategist for two world champion chess players (played by Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher).",
      "\"Chess\" is a love triangle, a spectacle, and a chance for the stars to raise the roof at the Imperial Theatre \u2013 the same place where Michele made her Broadway debut in 1995 in \"Les Miserables,\" at the age of eight.",
      "Her parents weren't show biz people \u2013 Dad owned a deli \u2013 and before she auditioned, they had no clue their daughter could sing. \"And as we were leaving, I turned to my Mom and I was like, 'I'm gonna get this. I think I'm gonna get this,'\" Michele recalled. \"And she said, 'Things like that don't happen to people like us.'\"",
      "In this case, Mom was wrong: Michele got the part, and went on to even greater heights in the musical \"Spring Awakening,\" and later became a household name in the hit TV show \"Glee.\"",
      "She hit a few bumps along the way, among them a difficult pregnancy with her first child in 2020, and flak on social media that she acted like a diva back in the \"Glee\" days. But things looked up in 2023, when she was asked to step into the shoes of her idol Barbra Streisand, and take over a struggling revival of \"Funny Girl.\"",
      "She said, \"I think that we all grow as we get older. It's hard being in an industry where there is such a spotlight on these phases and times in your life.\"",
      "And what was the pressure like to take over \"Funny Girl\"? It was the first time that I was really sort of in the spotlight after everything that had happened to me personally,\" Michele said. \"I wanted to finally show everyone that I could play this part, and play her really well.\"",
      "Long story short, Michele killed it, and turned a sinking show into a hit, despite suffering a miscarriage during her run. And when she was approached about doing \"Chess,\" she told producers that having another baby came first.\u00a0 \"And so my husband and I ended up doing IVF, which was in its own right very intense and challenging,\" she said. \"But you know, we got pregnant and had our daughter, who is wonderful and wild. And then they, you know, said, 'Would you like to do the show?' 'Absolutely!'\"",
      "Now, the 39-year-old mother of two is back at the Imperial Theatre, where it all began, serving up another knockout performance with a side of gratitude.",
      "I asked, \"What do you think that eight-year-old girl would think, back in that same theatre?\"",
      "\"I think that she'd be so proud, and she would just say, 'Thank you,' 'cause that's all she wanted,\" Michele said. \"And it's still what I want. My love for what I do was definitely reignited during 'Funny Girl.' And I'm very grateful for that. But I'm so happy to be here, and to be home.\"",

    "summary": "Rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to the 2012 Obama campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "summary": "British singer Lily Allen tells Anthony Mason about heartbreak and healing in her only TV interview about her new album, \"West End Girl.\"",
    "story": [
      "As an artist, Lily Allen stands firm by her belief that heartbreak can be a gift. After all, it helped lead to her latest album, \"West End Girl.\"",
      "\"You know, while I was writing it, I wasn't really sure that it was going to see the light of day,\" Allen told CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired Thursday, describing the music as \"an act of desperation.\" The studio album, released in late October, was written during the breakup of her nearly 4-year marriage to \"Stranger Things\" actor David Harbour.",
      "The theme of what's been described as Allen's epic \"breakup album\" centers around tales of a deceptive partner, which the singer says is based partly on truth and partly on fantasy.",
      "Harbour has not directly addressed his breakup with Allen or commented on her \"West End Girl\" album. But in an interview with Esquire UK, published around the album's release, Harbour discussed the importance of accepting your mistakes. \"I'd change everything or nothing. If you accept your past, you accept it completely, even the pain, the mistakes... It's all part of the journey, the growth, the wisdom, the empathy, and the connection, and if you change one thing, you change everything,\" he told the magazine at the time, adding that his work is about being honest.",
      "New album says \"everything that I needed to say\"",
      "But Allen said it was a \"nightmare\" holding onto the album and stunted her healing process. She felt a sense of relief and peace when she finally was able to share her words with the world.",
      "\"Since I've put it out, it's felt completely and utterly liberating. It was kind of hellish having it in the background,\" Allen said. \"I don't know. I just feel like I couldn't \u2013 it said everything that I needed to say. And I felt like I couldn't really like get on with my life until I'd said it.\"",
      "Her newly released music quickly lit up social media, with fans reacting to it on TikTok.",
      "Allen wrote most of the record within the span of 10 days at the end of last year. She was excited to complete the album, but at the same time her personal life was falling into pieces.",
      "After spending Christmas with her two daughters whom she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper, Allen decided to check herself into a treatment facility.",
      "\"I knew the things I was feeling were too intense,\" Allen explained her decision to seek professional help at the time following her separation. As a recovering alcoholic, Allen said she's not afraid of working on herself and knew she needed some quiet time.",
      "A cathartic release",
      "The Brooklyn townhouse that Allen and Harbour gave Architectural Digest a tour of in 2023 is now listed for around $8 million. The pair bought the home in early 2021 shortly after they got married.",
      "Allen said her music was cathartic \u2013 for herself and her children.",
      "\"All of the pain that, you know, that I've been through in the past year, they've been through too,\" Allen said. \" But you know, one thing that I wanted to do was to show my kids that, you know, you can use that pain and harness it and turn it into something else. And I think I've done that.\"",
      "Now, Allen is preparing for her 2026 tour \u2013 her first since she got sober in 2019.",
      "The singer said she's planning her touring schedule around her girls' holidays so they'll be able to come and bring their friends.",
      "\"I can't wait to have them there. It's like, it's gonna be... It's as much for them as it is for me,\" Allen said, adding that she feels like she's living her best life after a year of healing.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nursing-professional-degree-excluded-list/",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:10:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Nursing advocates say a proposed rule could worsen a shortage of professionals in the field and lead to worse health outcomes.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal from the Trump administration would exclude nursing from a list of professional degrees, a move that has drawn outcry from nursing advocates, who warn it could worsen the nation's nurse shortage by limiting how much students can borrow for their training.",
      "The change stems from changes authorized by the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act, which introduced a new cap on borrowing for higher education. Starting July 1, 2026, students enrolled in professional degree programs will be restricted to borrowing $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.",
      "Students in graduate programs that aren't deemed professional will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Nursing professionals say they're alarmed by the proposed rule's definition of what constitutes a professional degree, which lists some medical fields, including pharmacy, dentistry and medical doctors, but doesn't include nursing. Capping loans for nursing students could ultimately restrict students' access to enrolling in degree programs at a time when the industry is already grappling with a shortage of nurses, they say.",
      "The proposal would create \"obstacles for students who want to pursue advanced degrees, which would most likely lead to decreased students pursuing degrees in nursing,\" Kim Litwack, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Nursing, told CBS News. \"That means there will be less of these professionals joining the workforce.\"",
      "In a statement issued earlier this month, the Education Department said the proposal creates a new definition of a professional student to determine who qualifies for the higher loan limits.",
      "The goal of the changes, including the new loan caps, is to ensure that borrowers won't face \"insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off,\" said Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent in the statement.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the Education Department said 95% of nursing students won't be impacted by the borrowing cap.",
      "\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" said Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education at the agency. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",
      "What's a professional degree?",
      "Under the Education Department's proposal, a professional degree is one that \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession, and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"",
      "The programs that it defines as professional include: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology. Students in degree programs that aren't considered professional \u2014 such as those in nursing, physical therapy and physician assistant degrees \u2014 would have lower loan caps under the proposed rule.",
      "Other groups representing professions that were excluded under the proposal also issued objections, such as the Council on Social Work Education, which said it was \"disheartened and concerned.\" The American Academy of Audiology pointed out that audiology isn't included, which it said could discourage students from pursuing careers in the field.",
      "Nursing's exclusion from the list of professional degree programs \"makes no sense,\" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association.",
      "In addition to lowering the loan cap, the \"big, beautiful bill\" law also eliminates the Grad PLUS program that allows graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of obtaining a degree.",
      "Kennedy and other nursing industry advocates who disagree with the omission of nursing as a professional degree are hopeful the proposal could be changed before it's adopted.",
      "\"It feels like a miscommunication, and we hope the Department of Education changes the proposed language before the rule comes out for public comment. They did add professions to the list before it was released, so they could have added nurses, which clearly belong,\" she said.",
      "The Education Department said the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, although it didn't specify a date, and will be open for public comment.",
      "\"A real gut punch\"",
      "Olga Yakusheva, an economist and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, said limiting how much money nursing students can borrow could curb entry into the field.",
      "\"It's going to limit the ability of nurses to apply for graduate school, and on the back end, it will limit the number of nurses available in primary care settings and in hospitals,\" she said. \"Communities with shortages of physicians will feel this the most.\"",
      "Patricia Pittman, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said nurses fill critical medical care gaps in rural communities. The rule could create financial barriers that she says would disincentivize nurses from seeking advanced licensing, which ultimately could harm rural areas.",
      "\"Basically, nobody would be there if it weren't for these nurse practitioners,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Pittman also says it will have a negative effect on morale within the nursing profession.",
      "\"It's a real gut punch, and the result nurses are going to be angry about this,\" she said.",

      "A lawsuit filed in Michigan last week alleges that a Campbell Soup Company executive made offensive comments about Indian workers and said the company's products were for \"poor people\" during a conversation with a former employee.",
      "The suit was filed by Robert Garza, who was hired by Campbell's as a cybersecurity analyst in September 2024.",
      "Garza alleges that Campbell's executive Martin Bally made the offensive remarks during a meeting in November 2024, which was intended to discuss his salary. According to the lawsuit, Bally made several comments about Indian workers and said that Campbell's is \"highly [processed] food\" for \"poor people.\"",
      "Garza said he informed his manager, J.D. Aupperle, about the comments on Jan. 10 and claims Aupperle did not encourage him to report the incident to human resources.",
      "Garza was then \"abruptly terminated from employment\" just weeks later, the lawsuit says. The discussion between Garza and Bally was recorded, according to Detroit television station WDIV.",

      "Bally is one of many vice presidents at Campbell's, according to Regan. His\u00a0LinkedIn lists his title as vice president and chief information security officer.",
      "Campbell's said in a statement to CBS News that Bally is temporarily on leave while the company conducts an investigation.",
      "\"If the comments were in fact made, they are unacceptable,\" the company said. \"The comments heard on the recording about our food are not only inaccurate \u2014 they are patently absurd.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:51:25 -0500",
    "summary": "A higher Medicare Part B premium in 2026 could erode next year's cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security recipients, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "A higher Medicare premium set to go into effect in 2026 will push the monthly charge above $200 for the first time, with the increase likely to erode next year's cost-of-living increase for millions of Social Security recipients.",
      "The premium for Medicare's Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, will rise 9.7% to $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from the current $185 monthly cost, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0said earlier this month. It's the largest increase since 2022, when the Part B premium jumped 15%.",
      "The Part B deductible \u2014 the amount seniors must pay out of pocket before their coverage kicks in\u2014 is also rising about 10%, jumping to $283 next year from this year's $257.",
      "Medicare Part B premiums, deductibles and coinsurance rates are determined under a formula in the Social Security Act.",
      "The Part B premium, which is deducted automatically from seniors' monthly Social Security checks, is rising at a rate that's three times that of inflation, partly due to a rise in underlying health care costs, Anne Montgomery, senior health policy expert at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), said in a\u00a0blog\u00a0post. The Medicare premium increase means that seniors may not have much room to keep up with inflation, Max Richtman, the president and CEO of the same group, told CBS News.",
      "\"So many rely on [Social Security] for all or most of their income,\" he said. \"This is gonna hurt.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration set next year's cost-of-living increase at 2.8%, which will boost the average Social Security paycheck by $56 to about $2,071 per month.",
      "The Medicare Part B premium hike will consume about a third of next year's COLA, effectively lowering the rate to 1.9% \u2014 far below the current inflation rate of 3%, according to NCPSSM's analysis. People with lower monthly benefits could even see an effective COLA of zero, the group said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) told CBS News that the Medicare premium increase would have been significantly higher if the administration had not taken cost-saving measures, such as \"reigning in the fraudulent use of skin substitutes.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration is preserving Medicare by keeping the program affordable and sustainable for future generations,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Rising health care costs",
      "According to the CMS spokesperson, the main factor behind the Medicare premium and deductible increases is the projected growth in overall health care spending.",
      "Health care costs have been rising for all Americans, contributing to the sticker shock that seniors and other groups are experiencing. In 2023, Americans spent an average of $1,514 on out-of-pocket health care costs, an increase of 9% from 2020 on an inflation-adjusted basis, according to KFF.",
      "Working adults will also face higher health care premiums in 2026. Roughly 22 million Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces will also be faced with steep rate hikes if Congress fails to extend premium tax credits, which help lower the cost for the majority of people on ACA plans.",
      "Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, which became the main sticking point in the recent government shutdown. Without an extension, Americans who rely on the tax credit could see their costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Workers with employee-sponsored coverage are also likely to see their costs climb\u00a0next year, with most expected to pay 6% to 7% more for their 2026 plans, according to an analysis from consultant Mercer.",

      "The commission is warning customers to immediately stop using lithium-ion batteries that power e-bikes made by Seattle, Washington-based Rad Power Bikes. The batteries can ignite and explode, causing serious injury or death, the agency warned.",
      "Rad Power Bikes said it disagreed with the agency's warning.",
      "\"Rad Power Bikes firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC's characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe,\" a Rad spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The batteries that pose a fire hazard are model numbers are RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304, according to the CPSC. They are particularly vulnerable to catching fire when they are exposed to water and also to what the commission describes as \"debris.\"",
      "CPSC said it has received 31 reports of the batteries causing fires, including 12 reports of fires that caused property damage. Cumulatively, accidents related to the batteries have caused roughly $734,500 in property damage, it said, adding that some of the incidents took place when a battery was neither charging nor in use.",
      "CPSC is urging consumers to immediately stop using the batteries, which it said should be removed from the e-bikes and disposed of in accordance with local disposal procedures. It added that Rad Power Bikes has not agreed to recall the products.",
      "Rad Power Bikes added that its bikes are equipped with batteries that it says \"meet or exceed rigorous international safety standards.\"",

      "Rad also pointed out that all lithium-ion batteries can catch fire if they are improperly charged or mishandled, and that Rad advises against misusing them in its customer safety guides.",

    "summary": "Investors are now forecasting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting, scheduled for Dec. 10.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market rose on Monday, spurred by a jump in tech stocks and renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve may slash its benchmark interest rate at its December meeting.",
      "The S&P 500 climbed 108 points, or 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 294 points, or 0.6%, as of 2:10 p.m. EDT. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 2.7%.",
      "Companies with investments in artificial intelligence saw gains on Monday. Alphabet, which has been getting praise for its newest Gemini AI model, rallied 5.5% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. The jump in tech stocks comes as investors continue to assess the potential of AI-focused businesses, even as questions remain about\u00a0whether an AI bubble is forming.",
      "AI chipmaker Nvidia gained 2.1%.",
      "Stocks also rose on renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates for a third straight time at its Dec. 10 meeting. Traders now place the likelihood of a rate cut around nearly 80%, up from 41% on Thursday, according to data from CME FedWatch.",
      "But Monday's gains were hesitant, and the S&P 500 rallied to a gain of 1% only to halve it within the first 15 minutes of trading, before picking up momentum again.",
      "Stocks have been swinging sharply, not just day to day but also hour to hour, in recent weeks as worries weigh about what the Fed will do with interest rates and whether too much money is pouring into AI and creating a bubble. All the uncertainty is creating the biggest test for investors since an April sell-off, when President Donald Trump shocked the world with his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
      "Still, despite all the recent fear, the S&P 500 remains within 2.8% of its record  set last month.",
      "Fresh economic data",
      "Several more tests lie ahead this week for the market, though none loom quite as large as last week's profit report from Nvidia or the delayed jobs report from the U.S. government for September.",
      "One of the biggest tests will arrive on Tuesday, when the U.S. government will deliver data showing the inflation rate at the wholesale level in September.",
      "Economists expect the data to show a 2.6% rise from a year earlier, the same inflation rate as August. A higher-than-expected reading could deter the Fed from cutting its main interest rate in December because lower rates can worsen inflation. Some Fed officials have already argued against a December cut in part because inflation has stubbornly remained  above their 2% target.",
      "Monday's rally came at the start of an abbreviated trading week. U.S. markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. A day later, it's on to the rush of Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",
      "On Wall Street, U.S.-listed shares of Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk fell 5.8% Monday after it reported that its Alzheimer's drug failed to slow progression of the disease in a trial.",

A special committee of the company's board of directors said it had questions about the financing for the deal by the investors, who collectively own more than 60% of Grindr's stock.",
      "Bitcoin, meanwhile, continued its sharp swings. It was sitting near $87,600 after bouncing between $82,000 and $94,000 over the last week. It was near $125,000 last month.

    "summary": "Kohl's has promoted Michael Bender as its permanent CEO, nearly seven months after serving in the interim for that top role.",
    "story": [
      "Kohl's on Monday said it has tapped its fourth CEO in as many years, attempting to staunch an extended sales slide and to move beyond a leadership scandal that led to the departure of its previous chief executive.",
      "The company named Michael Bender as its permanent CEO nearly seven months after he took over on an interim basis.",
      "Bender replaced Ashley Buchanan who was fired in May after an internal investigation found that he had directed the company to do business with a vendor founded by someone with whom he had a personal relationship.",
      "At the same time, Kohl's is struggling to reverse a long-term sales slump amid a challenging economic environment for many shoppers, who are grappling with an affordability crisis. Retailers are also navigating tariffs rolled out this year by the Trump administration, adding to their challenges.",
      "\"The appointment of Michael Bender as permanent CEO of Kohl's brings some much-needed stability to the beleaguered chain,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with GlobalData, in a Monday research note.",
      "He added, \"Unfortunately. Kohl's has been one of the worst performers in retail \u2013 with sales and market share plummeting since 2019. This chronic underperformance is directly linked to operational sloppiness and the absence of a clear strategy.\"",
      "The board conducted a comprehensive search using an external firm before picking Bender as its next CEO, Chairman John Schlifske said in the statement.",
      "Bender is a retail veteran with 30 years of experience at retailers from Walmart to PepsiCo.",
      "Buchanan, who was Kohl's CEO for less than four months, had replaced CEO Tom Kingsbury, who had served as the company's leader from 2023 until early 2025. Prior to Kingsbury, Michelle Gass was Kohl's CEO until she departed in late 2022 to become the president of Levi Strauss.",
      "Kohl's releases its third-quarter earnings results Tuesday.",
      "Shares of Kohl's Corp., based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, were unchanged Monday.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Nov 2025 20:01:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Those prioritizing economy say Trump is not spending enough time on it, as ratings of economy, his handling of inflation slip.",
    "story": [
      "The situation around Venezuela has Americans asking to know more.",
      "Across party lines, big majorities say the administration needs to explain what the U.S. intends regarding any action, and that it has not done so clearly yet.",
      "Meanwhile, what Americans hear from the White House about inflation is, they say, not what they're actually feeling at home: rising prices and worsening economic views.",
      "In the meantime, Americans do not think of Venezuela as a major threat to the US. Instead, more see a minor one, and they are largely opposed to potential military action.",
      "So, the idea of potential U.S. military action in Venezuela meets with widespread disapproval. It doesn't get overwhelming backing from Republicans either.",
      "Three in four Americans also say Trump would need congressional approval before taking military action in Venezuela, including just over half of Republicans.",
      "Just one in five Americans have heard a lot about the U.S. military buildup in the first place. That may be another expression of that sense of limited information about the purpose.",
      "The current military attacks on boats suspected of bringing drugs find division \u2014 just over half approve, driven by nearly universal support among Republicans \u2014 though Americans overall overwhelmingly say they should see the evidence that there are drugs.",
      "However, most Americans don't think U.S. military action in Venezuela would change the amount of drugs coming into the U.S.",
      "Looking more closely within the president's GOP base: MAGA Republicans are actually more supportive of potential military action than non-MAGA ones.",
      "For context, that is similar to what we've seen over time on many issues, including foreign policy, in which that part of the base is largely deferential to the president. (As one example, MAGA was also supportive of the bombing in Iran months ago.) Most of them say the president has explained things, and in turn, are more apt to see any action in Venezuela as decreasing the amount of drugs entering the U.S.",
      "But many who are opposed to military action, including those within the GOP ranks, may also be seeing this in terms of issue priorities. They're a little more likely to judge the administration on what it does about the economy than those in favor. And most who judge him on the economy think he isn't spending enough time on it.",
      "Here's what Americans say about the economy",
      "There's a disconnect between how Americans hear the White House describing the economy, and what they're feeling themselves.",
      "Most Americans say Trump describes things with prices and inflation as better than they really are.",
      "(This includes four in 10 Republicans who say this about Trump. They are also among those more likely to say prices are going up.)",
      "This comes as ratings for the overall economy continue to be low \u2014 as they've been for years \u2014 ticking down this week to their lowest mark in 2025.",
      "Prices, more generally, are still seen by most as going up.",
      "As we head into the holiday season, that economic dissatisfaction includes the majority of Americans who feel President Trump's policies are making the cost of food and groceries, specifically, go up.",
      "So, that disconnect appears to continue to weigh on the president's ratings.",
      "There are many ways Americans judge a president. For those who say they judge Mr. Trump most on what he does about the economy and inflation, they overwhelmingly say he isn't spending enough time on that.",
      "That, in turn, has continued to push his approval on handling the economy and inflation down over the course of several months. That trend continues this week, with assessments of the overall economy, and his ratings for handling the economy and inflation, hitting lows for the year.",
      "More than two-thirds disapprove of his handling of inflation.",
      "He does especially poorly on handling the economy among people who mainly judge him on that.",
      "Among independents, his ratings for handling the economy, and his ratings overall, have also hit lows for the year. That has continued to push his approval rating overall lower over time too, now down to their low point for his second term after a steady decline over recent months.",
      "The president does a little better on his handling of immigration, backed by continued large support from the GOP base, as has been the case for months.",
      "The decline in the president's overall approval ratings connects to people's economic priorities in this way: even among those who voted for him in 2024, disapproval today is more likely to come when people are judging him mostly on the economy.",
      "Deportation",
      "The administration's deportation program continues to split the country, but support is underpinned by strong approval from Republicans.",
      "Most \u2014 particularly those outside the GOP base \u2014 continue to feel that ICE is detaining more people than necessary.",
      "But the deportation program is seen by many as more undermining than strengthening the economy.",
      "One possible reason: a third of the country (who tend to live in cities and suburbs) say it is impacting their community for the worse, and they feel people in their area are staying home more as a result of the program.",
      "Epstein files",
      "Americans across party lines think it is important to see the Epstein files released.",
      "Americans overwhelmingly believe they will contain damaging information about powerful people. Most say it's too soon to know if what's in them is true. On balance, though, more think that information will be true rather than false.",
      "Republicans are more satisfied with how the Trump administration is handling the Epstein case than they were in the summer. (The survey was conducted just after Trump said Congress should vote to release the files, which they did shortly thereafter.) Today, most others are not satisfied.",
      "However, the president's Republican base says issues surrounding the files are not important to how they judge him. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans say this doesn't affect how they evaluate Trump overall. (Independents and Democrats, though, give it comparably more importance in this regard.)",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,489 U.S. adults interviewed between November 19-21, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "Those sinful-looking blueberry pancakes, and that nice, noisy foamy latte \u2013 would you believe they are rescuing journalism, in and around Camden, Maine, at least?",
      "Here in lobster country, at the Villager Cafe, customers can have their breakfast or lunch with a side of news, a weekly newspaper called the Midcoast Villager. \"I was just reading about the SNAP benefits and different food pantries in the area,\" said one cafe customer.",
      "The cafe subsidizes the paper; the newsroom is one floor up. Throw in the rent from all the other tenants in the building, along with revenue from the Inn at Camden Place next door (same ownership), and it all helps.",
      "\"From the business standpoint, it achieves a sustainability,\" said Reade Brower. At one time, Brower owned almost all of Maine's newspapers, before selling most of them off. In September 2024, he merged four weeklies into the Midcoast Villager. The cafe opened this past April, but not just to make money.",
      "\"The accountability issues and local sports and all that stuff is important to a lot of people,\" he said. \"I don't think that's enough to sell and keep newspapers alive right now. I think it has to revolve around community. And what better way to serve community than to invite people here for food and to mix all this stuff together?\"",
      "How often do you see the owner of a newspaper, and members of his staff, hanging out with readers over breakfast?",
      "Kathleen Capetta helps Brower run what they both see as an experiment in rebuilding trust in news. \"We're present, we're visible, we're real,\" she said. \"We're not behind a screen.\"",
      "And would that experiment work if the food weren't good? \"Absolutely not, no!\" Capetta laughed.",
      "\"It's good, classic diner food, but a little bit elevated, which is I think kind of like our paper,\" said deputy editor Alex Seitz-Wald. He is the face of the newspaper when he parks himself in the cafe on Friday mornings, to hear complaints, story tips, whatever. \"Having a place where people can vent, or can say something, and have it be heard, I think is really valuable,\" he said.",
      "Seitz-Wald was an NBC politics reporter in Washington, D.C., for a decade before taking a chance \u2013 and a pay cut \u2013 to work for the Midcoast Villager, a start-up in a field where two newspapers die every week.",
      "How's the Villager doing? Circulation revenue, we're told, is 40% above what all four papers it replaced took in \u2013 so, promising.",
      "\"I'm quite glad that I still have a newspaper to work for,\" said Glenn Billington. A local news lifer, he's the optimistic ad salesman and columnist for the Midcoast Villager, just as he was for one of its now-defunct predecessors.",
      "The mascot on the paper's masthead is Vern, who is the epitome of Midcoast Maine. \"He sure is,\" said Billington. \"Look at his sou'wester. He's got the hat that you wear when the wind blows from the southwest and it brings rain. And he's got the telescope. Vern's looking at the future of newspapers.\"",
      "What one sees at the Villager Cafe is old-fashioned \u2013 people sitting down at tables, eating and talking and looking at each other eye-to-eye. Or as Brower put it, \"You're picking up what we're putting down.\"",

      "Transportation officials will consider using the new dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five-star ratings once a final rule is adopted, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday in a news release.",
      "The department also noted that THOR-05F will be available to manufacturers to build models and to the automotive industry, which can begin testing the model in their vehicles.",
      "The road to THOR-05F",
      "The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man.",
      "The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.",
      "The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said.",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy's support but said she won't celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing \u2014 a step that has been delayed numerous times.",
      "\"I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we've won,\" Kuhn said Friday. \"But we are far from crossing the finish line.\"",
      "Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Despite Duffy's announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said.",
      "\"Certainly, we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,\" Young said. \"But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we're using are doing a good job.\"",
      "Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow.",
      "U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement.",
      "\"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor.",
      "\"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said.",

    "story": [
      "Bitcoin continued to slide on Friday, extending a weeks-long slump that has wiped out nearly $800 billion in value since the cryptocurrency hit its 2025 peak last month. The downturn has stripped away all of bitcoin's gains this year \u2014 and raised questions about where it might go from here.",
      "Since closing at almost $125,000 on Oct. 6, its highest price this year, bitcoin has shed about one-third of its value. On Friday, bitcoin sank below $82,000 before rebounding slightly to $83,509 before noon EDT, according to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator.",
      "The cryptocurrency, which is trading at its lowest level since April, is now on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022, when a spate of corporate collapses sparked turbulence in the crypto sector, Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday.",
      "The precipitous drop comes as Wall Street grapples with unease over whether there's a bubble in artificial technology and tech stocks, prompting a shift away from assets that are viewed as carrying more risk, analysts say. Investors are also cautious given signs of weakness in the labor market, and the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision next month, with more economists now expecting the Fed to hold off on cutting rates.",
      "\"The future is uncertain. It almost feels like it's moving back to the question: do I even want to hold [bitcoin] in this environment?\" said Thomas Chen, the CEO of cryptocurrency company Function, in an email.",
      "Why is Bitcoin falling?",
      "Concerns about an AI bubble can translate into turbulence for cryptocurrencies because tech stocks tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, experts noted.",
      "\"When tech sneezes, it's natural to expect Bitcoin to catch a cold,\" noted Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, in an email.",
      "Aside from pulling back from riskier assets, some investors may be selling bitcoin to cover margin calls. Coinbase, for example, now offers \"perpetual futures,\" a product that lets traders use up to 10-to-1 leverage on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
      "Leveraged positions can force investors to sell because borrowing amplifies every price move \u2014 for both gains and losses. Even a small drop in the underlying asset can lead to an outsized loss on a leveraged trade. But if an asset tumbles and the investor can't meet the margin requirements, the trading platform may automatically liquidate the position, which leads to more selling and downward pressure on its price.",
      "\"When traders borrow heavily to magnify positions, any reversal triggers liquidations that accelerate the move,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory organization, said in an email.",
      "Large declines in bitcoin's price aren't unusual, and the cryptocurrency has always rebounded, experts noted.",
      "Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, said in a Tuesday email that bitcoin has historically experienced around five corrections of 20-30% or more during bull markets, adding that the issues may represent \"temporary headwinds\" as some investors could view lower crypto prices as a buying opportunity.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:15:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The agency's \"Golden Age of Travel\" campaign aims to restore civility to air travel. Experts say they have doubts.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday unveiled a campaign aimed at bringing more civility to air travel, urging Americans to dress \"with respect\" and remember simple courtesies like saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" to flight attendants. Travel experts say they're skeptical it will make much difference.",
      "The new plan \u2014 called \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You\"\u00a0\u2014 is meant to \"jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel,\" the agency said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is rolling out the civility campaign in part as a response to what the agency called a record rise in unruly passenger incidents, including altercations with other travelers and airline staff. The issue isn't new, with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration data showing that incidents with unruly passengers peaked in 2021, although reports remain roughly double their pre-pandemic level.",
      "The Transportation Department didn't define what it meant by \"dressing with respect.\" In a Wednesday social media post, Duffy wrote, \"Dress up to go to the airport, help a stranger out, and be in a good mood.\"",
      "Duffy said he's encouraging air travelers to ask themselves the following five questions to ensure civility:",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?Are you dressing with respect?Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?",
      "Are you dressing with respect?",
      "Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?",
      "Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?",
      "Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Can dressing better improve economy class?",
      "Travel experts are skeptical that the Transportation Department's call to dress up for the airport will result in meaningful changes. Most travelers now prize comfort over formality, especially given the typically tight seating in economy and the likelihood of delays.",
      "In response to Duffy's social media post, some users chimed in with their own ideas \u2014 from widening cramped economy seats to making security checkpoints friendlier for travelers. While some agreed that a little more civility would be welcome, others noted that comfortable clothes make flying more tolerable in such tight quarters.",
      "A few decades ago, when Americans typically dressed up to fly, the travel experience looked a whole lot different.",
      "\"Economy class was actually nice. Now, everyone is wedged together on planes,\" Chris Elliott, a travel expert and consumer advocate, told CBS News.",
      "Sarah Silbert, a strategist at the flight search engine Points Path, said the clothing guideline isn't enforceable and isn't likely to shift traveler behavior.",
      "\"It's more of a soft nudge about travel etiquette,\" she told CBS News. \"Given how cramped and stressful flying can be for most people now, it's easy to see why a message about 'dressing up' will draw pushback.\"",
      "Travelers' interpretations may also vary significantly, experts added.",
      "\"Do I imagine anyone would be able to agree on what the dress code is? No,\" Daniel Green, co-founder of Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News. He added that he doesn't think there should be a dress code for travelers, either.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think this is just a well-intentioned messaging campaign about behaving well in public that will likely have no practical or tangible implications for people,\" he said.",
      "Changes in air travel",
      "The rise in unruly passengers stems from several issues, including alcohol, drugs and mental health issues, as well as stress from dealing with crowded airports and problems like flight delays, according to Transport Security International, a travel publication.",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of the flight-deals site Going.com, noted that the \"golden age of travel\" was hardly golden for most Americans. Airfare was so expensive that flying was largely limited to the wealthy. Because flying is more affordable today, air travel has become a more democratized experience, he added.",
      "\"Many more people are traveling today. You see people from all walks of life getting on planes, and this campaign harkens back to a time when air travel was only for the elite,\" he told CBS News.",
      "He also objects to the notion that the \"golden age\" of flying provided a better passenger experience than today's flights.",
      "\"There are many ways in which it was an objectively worse experience. The flights took longer, they didn't have Wi-Fi, and there was cigarette smoke wafting through cabins,\" he said.",
      "Even so, he said he doubts the Transportation Department's civility push will inspire anyone to start dressing to the nines.",
      "\"If you think it's a good thing that most of society today can afford to buy tickets and travel, then you have to accept that people are going to behave how they're going to behave,\" Keyes said. \"I don't think I would want to live in a society that had dress recommendations to be on an airplane.\"",

      "The online retailer\u00a0agreed to the payouts in September\u00a0to resolve a 2023 Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit that accused Amazon of misleading customers into enrolling in Prime and making it hard for them to cancel their membership.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 A vintage blue VW bus that became an unlikely symbol of resilience after it survived a California wildfire made its public debut this week, shiny and like-new after Volkswagen spent months restoring the damaged vehicle.",
      "The bus went viral in January when an Associated Press photographer captured it looking surprisingly unharmed by the deadly Palisades Fire, a spot of blue and white dwarfed by the charred remains of a Malibu neighborhood. Volkswagen saw the accompanying AP story and reached out to the owner, Megan Weinraub. Upon closer inspection, VW technicians discovered that while the bus had survived, it had smoke damage and blistered paint, rust and a window busted by the heat.",
      "In its restoration, the 1977 Type 2 Microbus named Azul - Spanish for the color blue - again brought people together as technicians consulted the broader community of VW enthusiasts in a shared mission to revive what was a quirky middle-aged vehicle.",
      "\"It melted and Volkswagen saved it,\" Weinraub said Thursday at the LA Auto Show, standing with the bus's previous owner, Preston Martin. \"It was a giant relief because it wasn't my first priority with everything going on.\"",
      "While Weinraub calls the microbus \"Azul,\" it became known as the \"Magic bus\" on social media, CBS News Los Angeles points out.",
      "\"I was lucky and grateful to have the opportunity for them to restore it because I wouldn't have been able to restore it myself,\" she told the station.",
      "Weintraub and Martin still can't believe the bus they wrote off as a goner is now ready to take them on another surfing adventure. The last time they saw the pre-burned Azul was two days before the Palisades Fire broke out, when they parked the bus near Weinraub's apartment after surfing.",
      "Mark J. Terrill, the AP photographer who captured the original image, was on hand when Weinraub and Martin saw the bus for the first time after its restoration in late October.",
      "Volkswagen hauled the microbus to its Oxnard facility west of Los Angeles where it houses historic VW vehicles. Vehicle technicians Farlan Robertson and Gunnar Wynarski sourced hard-to-find parts, got creative and reached out to a lot of people.",
      "\"At the bottom of it it was to try to take the vehicle that everyone else saw and do what we could to improve upon it, but not change it,\" said Robertson, \"to actually have it come out and be the revived, resurrected vehicle returned to its former glory.\"",

    "summary": "A Treasury Department analysis indicates that new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil producers have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "A Treasury Department analysis indicates that new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil producers have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine, the department said.",
      "One key benchmark for Russian oil prices \u2014 Urals crude \u2014 had fallen by at least 21% since a set of new sanctions were announced last month, a Treasury official said Thursday. The official also pointed to a decrease in the amount of oil departing from Russia to unknown destinations and said transaction volume has decreased.",
      "The sanctions, announced Oct. 22, target Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft. They represent the first direct actions against Russia of the second Trump administration and some of the most aggressive since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Since the announcement, nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil have stated intentions to pause their purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December, Treasury has said.",
      "A November 17 memo from the Treasury's Sanctions Economic Analysis Division assessed that the \"sanctions on Russian energy firms Lukoil and Rosneft are having their intended effect of dampening Russian revenues by lowering the price of Russian oil and therefore the country's ability to fund its war effort against Ukraine.\"",
      "The memo said that several grades of Russian oil are trading at multi-year lows, and are \"well below all other international prices.\"",
      "The memo also indicated that sanctions are \"likely to have a long-term negative impact on the quantity of Russian oil sold.\"",
      "The sanctions set a Friday, Nov. 21, deadline for companies to wind down dealings with Rosneft and Lukoil. Nearly three dozen entities are petitioning Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for additional time to wind down operations, which would take them beyond the original deadline. That is not unusual, as companies work to comply with U.S. sanctions.",
      "Treasury has issued some extensions already for certain transactions involving Lukoil's retail service stations and contracts for the sale of the firm's international assets until Dec. 13. A separate waiver for deals pertaining to Lukoil's entities in Bulgaria was extended through April 29, according to a CBS review of the licenses.",
      "A Treasury official also said Thursday that many Chinese and Indian entities \u2014 including banks and refineries \u2014 are conscious of the sanctions and are \"risk averse, do recognize the importance of the relationships with the West, and are moving to comply.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month the sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies were driven by President Vladimir Putin's \"refusal to end this senseless war.\" Treasury said the companies have helped to \"fund the Kremlin's war machine.\"",
      "Last month on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" Bessent told moderator Margaret Brennan that the latest actions could cut Russia's oil revenue 20% or 30%. A Treasury official said the impacts are still being assessed, but that \"it is clear that there will be revenue impacts\" from the sanctions.",
      "The oil price plunge comes as President Trump presses Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire. At various points, he has expressed frustration with the leaders of both countries.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:47:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Criminals are targeting shoppers with fake websites, bogus charities and other fraudulent pitches, according to insights from Visa.",
    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, marking a pickup after previous employment data had shown a slowdown in hiring. The report marks the first official job tally since the\u00a0government shutdown ended last week, ending a six-week blackout on labor data.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 50,000 jobs in September, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose 4.4% in September, up from 4.3% in August and the highest level since Oct. 2021. With robust job growth in September, that suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "The Labor Department also revised job growth down for July and August by a combined 33,000, a sign that hiring during those months was weaker than previously reported.",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest boost in jobs, with 43,000 hires in September. The federal workforce, meanwhile, lost 3,000 jobs that month.",
      "Investment advisor firm Capital Economics estimates 150,000 federal workers will drop off the government's payroll in the fourth quarter this year, mainly due to the end of the Trump administration's deferred resignation programs.",
      "The job market has been losing momentum for much of this year, with previous employment reports indicating a slowdown in hiring. At the same time, employers have been announcing layoffs in recent months, leading to the worst October for job reductions in 22 years, according to\u00a0outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Verizon said it would lay off 13,000 employees on Thursday. That follows major recent job cuts by\u00a0Target, Amazon, UPS\u00a0and other major companies.",
      "What it means",
      "The September employment figures suggest job growth remains firm amid concerns that the labor market was at risk of stalling.",
      "\"The September jobs report may be backward-looking, but offers reassurance that the labor market wasn't crumbling before the government shutdown,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Although job growth has weakened, \"it is not collapsing,\" added Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "The hiring numbers will shape Federal Reserve officials' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their next meeting in December. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B. Riley Financial, thinks the odds of a rate cut have \"diminished significantly\" given there will not be a full October employment report and the November report won't be issued until after the Fed meets in December.",
      "Ashworth expects the Fed to delay its next rate cut until January. The probability of a rate cut now stands at 22%, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Delayed employment reports",
      "The September jobs report, originally slated for Oct. 3, was pushed back by the government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. The delay means it offers a belated snapshot of the labor market just before federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1.",
      "On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it won't publish the full October employment report, which was originally slated for release on Nov. 7. Instead, the agency will fold select October data into the November report, which is set for release on Dec. 16.",

    "summary": "The rulings\u200b from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie are a significant victory for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday ordered the criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey\u00a0and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured their indictments, was unlawfully appointed to the role.",
      "The rulings from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie are a significant victory for Comey and James, who both argued their prosecutions are retaliatory and motivated by President Trump's efforts to punish his political foes.",
      "\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie wrote in her opinion in the Comey case, a line that she repeated in her ruling in the James case.",
      "Currie ordered the indictments to be dismissed without prejudice, which would allow prosecutors to seek charges again. She suggested that prosecutors could not seek a new indictment in Comey's case since the statute of limitations for the offenses expired at the end of September.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking at an unrelated news conference in Memphis on Monday, told reporters the Justice Department will \"be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal.\"",
      "Lawyers for both Comey and James are also seeking to have their indictments tossed out on numerous other legal grounds, including that the prosecutions are vindictive and selective. The judge overseeing Comey's case heard arguments on his motion last week but has yet to rule.",
      "\"I am heartened by today's victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,\" James said in a statement in response to the ruling. \"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.\"",
      "In a video statement, Comey said \"the message has to be sent that the president of the United States cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies.\"",
      "\"I'm grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence, and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking,\" he said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an appearance on Fox News, \"We believe the attorney in this case, Lindsey Halligan, is not only extremely qualified for this position, but she was in fact legally appointed.\"",
      "The judge's rulings",
      "In her decisions, the judge found that Halligan's appointment violated both a federal law known as Section 546, which governs U.S. attorney vacancies, and the Constitution's Appointments Clause.",
      "In evaluating the text of Section 546, Currie found that the power to name an interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia for 120 days to fill the current vacancy rested not with the attorney general, but with district court for the region. She wrote that if the government's interpretation of the law were correct, then the president could evade the Senate confirmation process \"indefinitely\" by \"stacking\" consecutive 120-day appointments.",
      "\"In sum, the text, structure, and history of section 546 point to one conclusion: the Attorney General's authority to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney lasts for a total of 120 days from the date she first invokes section 546 after the departure of a Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorney,\" Currie wrote. \"If the position remains vacant at the end of the 120-day period, the exclusive authority to make further interim appointments under the statute shifts to the district court, where it remains until the President's nominee is confirmed by the Senate. Ms. Halligan was not appointed in a manner consistent with this framework.\"",
      "She concluded that Halligan has been unlawfully serving as interim U.S. attorney since Sept. 22. Comey was indicted Sept. 25, and James was charged Oct. 9.",
      "Halligan's appointment",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in one of the criminal cases brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith. She took over as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia in a temporary capacity in late September and sought the indictments against Comey and James soon after.",
      "Bondi tapped Halligan as interim U.S. attorney shortly after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Bondi appointed Halligan under Section 546, the federal law that governs U.S. attorney vacancies and allows the attorney general to select an interim U.S. attorney, who can then serve for 120 days. The Trump administration has invoked that law and another measure to install temporary prosecutors in New Jersey, Nevada and Los Angeles, though three different federal judges have all found they were serving unlawfully.",
      "In the U.S. Attorney's Office in eastern Virginia, Siebert had first been tapped to lead the office in January to serve for 120 days. Ahead of the expiration of his term, the federal court for the region voted to keep him in the role, exercising authority granted to it under federal law.",
      "After Siebert departed, though, Mr. Trump urged Bondi to install Halligan in the post. Bondi issued a September order purporting to name Halligan as the interim U.S. attorney, to serve for 120 days. Days after she took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Halligan secured the two-count indictment against Comey, which accuses him of lying to Congress during testimony in September 2020 and obstructing a congressional proceeding. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted in early October on charges of bank fraud. Both have pleaded not guilty to their respective charges.",
      "Comey's attorneys argued that his indictment was \"fatally flawed\" because Halligan, who alone presented the case to the grand jury and signed the indictment, was invalidly appointed to her position.",
      "They argued that under the framework for a temporary U.S. attorney appointment, the 120-day clock starts from the time of the attorney general's initial appointment of Siebert and limits the total tenure of interim appointments to 120 days. Because Siebert had already served the 120 days, only the district court had authority to appoint a successor, defense lawyers said.",
      "But Justice Department lawyers defended the validity of Halligan's selection and argued the 120-day limit applies on a \"per-appointment basis.\" Each appointment, they said, triggers its own clock and requires the attorney general to revisit her interim selections every 120 days.",
      "To shore up Halligan's work in Comey and James' cases, the Justice Department submitted to the court an October order from Bondi that also purported to name her special attorney, applied retroactively, and ratified her actions before the grand juries and signature on the indictments.",
      "Justice Department lawyers argued that even if Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid, any government lawyer can present a case to a grand jury or sign an indictment, and Bondi has the authority to make her a government attorney.",
      "But Currie rejected Bondi's attempt to retroactively name Halligan as a special attorney and wrote that the Justice Department has not pointed to any authority that allows the attorney general to \"reach back in time and rewrite the terms of a past appointment.\" She also said the attorney general's attempt to ratify Halligan's actions falls short.",
      "\"The implications of a contrary conclusion are extraordinary,\" Currie wrote. \"It would mean the Government could send any private citizen off the street \u2014 attorney or not \u2014 into the grand jury room to secure an indictment so long as the Attorney General gives her approval after the fact. That cannot be the law.\"",
      "Currie heard arguments on Comey's bid to dismiss the case on the appointment grounds earlier this month alongside the similar effort by James. Like in Comey's case, only Halligan presented the case against James to the grand jury and signed the indictment.",
      "Asked on Monday if the ruling would have any impact on Halligan's role, Bondi told reporters, \"it does not.\"",
      "\"We have made Lindsay Halligan a special U.S. attorney so she is in court,\" Bondi said. \"She can fight in court just like she was, and we believe we will be successful on appeal.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa. Mr. Trump has labeled antifa as a domestic terror organization, though there isn't a formal system for designating U.S.-based terror groups, and antifa usually refers to a loose collection of left-wing activists rather than a single organization with centralized leadership.",
      "Mr. Trump also considered labeling the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror group in his first term.",

      "The goal of what the White House is calling the \"Genesis Mission\" is to speed the research and scientific discovery process by analyzing massive data sets in the science, engineering, energy and health care spaces from the federal government, university and private sector with supercomputing technology. It's an AI initiative the White House hopes will result in quicker breakthroughs in areas of research including disease therapies.",

      "\"By fusing massive federal data sets, advanced supercomputing capabilities, and world-leading scientific facilities, the Genesis mission will use AI to automate experiment design, accelerate simulation and generate protective models for everything from protein folding to fusion plasma dynamics,\" Krastios said. \"This will shorten discovery timelines from years to days or even hours, empowering scientists to test bolder hypotheses and discover breakthroughs currently unreachable.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has designated the Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization, but some say the Venezuelan entity is \"not a group\" at all.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government's designation of the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization officially took effect Monday as part of President Trump's aggressive campaign to combat drug trafficking into the United States. The U.S. identifies Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the group's leader \u2014 and he says the claims of narcoterrorism are actually part of a bid by Mr. Trump to force him from power.",
      "The terrorist designation, which was announced last week, is designed to put more pressure on Maduro, even as U.S. warships and more than 10,000 American troops step up training exercises in the region. The U.S. military has also launched deadly strikes on boats it alleges were carrying drugs off Venezuela's coast \u2014 many of them allegedly run by the Tren de Aragua gang, which the U.S. accuses of ties to the Maduro regime.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, Maduro's government said it \"absolutely rejects the new and ridiculous fabrication\" designating \"the nonexistent Cartel of the Suns as a terrorist organization, thus repeating an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela, under the classic U.S. format of regime change.\"",
      "Ahead of the designation announcement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed the group was \"responsible for terrorist violence \u2026 as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "The Cartel de los Soles was also hit in July with U.S. economic sanctions, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said highlighted \"the illegitimate Maduro regime's facilitation of narco-terrorism through terrorist groups like Cartel de los Soles.\"",
      "What is \u2014 and what isn't \u2014 the Cartel de los Soles?",
      "But what is the so-called Cartel of the Suns? It is not, in the traditional sense, a Latin American drug cartel along the lines of the family-run Sinaloa or the Jalisco New Generation.",
      "The \"suns\" in the name refers to the insignia used for decades to adorn the uniforms of high-ranking Venezuelan military officers.",
      "Venezuelans, including prosecutors and other officials, started using the term colloquially in the 1990s to refer to the cadre of high-ranking military officers who'd grown rich from facilitating drug-running. As corruption expanded across the country, first under the late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and then under Maduro as his successor, analysts say the term came to encompass the loosely defined network of police and government officials that facilitated and profited off of activities ranging from illegal mining to fuel and drug trafficking.",
      "The term was first elevated to define an alleged Maduro-led drug trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department, during President Trump's first administration, announced indictments of Venezuela's leader and members of his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges. The Justice Department accused Maduro, through the Cartel de los Soles, of working directly with the Colombian rebel group FARC to traffic cocaine through Venezuela to the U.S.",
      "The designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization has generally been reserved for groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, but the Trump administration has expanded its use to designate eight Latin American organizations accused of drug trafficking and people smuggling, calling it an effort to counter narcoterrorism.",
      "Some analysts say it's a stretch to even define the Cartel de los Soles as a single unified organization.",
      "\"It is not a group,\" Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America think tank told The Associated Press. \"It's not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don't have regular meetings. They don't have a hierarchy.\"",
      "\"It is not a hierarchical or ideological group,\" agrees the InSight Crime outlet, which is run by two former journalists who covered Latin America extensively for decades. \"Its structure consists of a diffuse network of cells embedded within Venezuela's main military branches: the army, the navy, the air force, and the national guard, from the lowest to the highest ranks.\"",
      "\"Although the concept is primarily associated with the military sector, other branches of the [Venezuelan] State embedded within the criminal ecosystem have also been identified, including police forces, the executive branch, and various public officials,\" InSight Crime said in an analysis of the purported cartel published in September.",
      "Terrorist designation comes amid U.S. military strikes and build-up",
      "In recent weeks, the U.S. military has conducted at least 21 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing dozens of people and sparking a debate in Washington about the legality of the extrajudicial attacks.",
      "The Trump administration has carried out the strikes without providing evidence to support its assertions that the boats are carrying drugs and operated by criminal organizations. It says the attacks, which began in late September off the coast of Venezuela and expanded to the eastern Pacific, are meant to stop narcotics reaching American soil.",
      "But Maduro, and some others, see the U.S. military operations and massive buildup of hardware in the region as an effort to precipitate his ouster \u2014   if not the prelude to an overt operation to topple his government.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said the formal designation of the Cartel de los Soles will give a \"whole bunch of new options to the United States\" to address Maduro's alleged crimes.",
      "But speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, he declined to give details on what those options included, or to say whether the U.S. military was planning to carry out strikes on targets inside Venezuela.",
      "\"Nothing is off the table, but nothing's automatically on the table,\" he said.",
      "Since American troops and hardware \u2014   including the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's most advanced aircraft carrier \u2014   started pouring into the Caribbean earlier this year, Venezuela's U.S.-backed political opposition has been more confidently voicing its perennial promise to see Maduro forced from office, fueling speculation over the real endgame of what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation.",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell during an extensive interview for 60 Minutes just weeks ago whether the U.S. operations around Venezuela were about \"getting rid of Maduro,\" President Trump said they were \"about many things,\" but he said the Venezuelan leader's days in office were likely numbered.",

    "story": [
      "Fewer than one-third of the individuals arrested by Border Patrol during the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement crackdown in Charlotte were classified as criminals, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security document obtained by CBS News.",
      "The government document undermines claims by Trump administration officials who said the crackdown, dubbed Operation Charlotte's Web, was primarily focused on apprehending immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also had criminal histories and posed a threat to public safety.",
      "Roughly 200 green-uniformed Border Patrol agents recorded more than 270 immigration arrests during the Charlotte campaign, which began on the weekend of Nov. 15, the document shows. Fewer than 90 of those arrested by Border Patrol were categorized as \"criminal aliens\" in the document.",
      "Those statistics do not include arrests made by officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, though Border Patrol played the principal role in Operation Charlotte's Web. The document also does not specify the severity of the crimes of the detainees listed as criminals, nor whether their records included convictions or solely criminal charges.",
      "While DHS has publicly maintained that the crackdown in Charlotte is ongoing, separate internal documents say Border Patrol's operation there concluded, with agents demobilizing from the area last week. ICE has a permanent presence in North Carolina, and is expected to continue operations there.",
      "CBS News has reported, citing U.S. officials and internal DHS documents, that Border Patrol is preparing to launch a new operation in New Orleans as soon as the first week of December.",
      "A spokesperson for DHS said the information reported by CBS News is \"likely inaccurate,\" but did not offer a breakdown of criminality that was different to the numbers contained in the document.",
      "The spokesperson cited a press release that announced over 130 immigration arrests in the Charlotte area during the first two days of the operation, including 44 individuals who DHS said had criminal charges or convictions for aggravated assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault on a police officer, battery, driving under the influence and other crimes. Two of the detainees were identified as gang members in the release.",
      "The DHS document obtained by CBS News offers a window into the most recent operation led by outspoken and controversial Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the de facto on-the-ground enforcer of President Trump's clampdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the past months, the Trump administration has tasked Bovino and teams of Border Patrol agents with bringing its mass deportation campaign to several cities led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Chicago and, most recently, Charlotte. The deployment has been unprecedented in nature and scope. Border Patrol's work has been historically limited to stopping the illegal movement of people and drugs along the borders with Mexico and Canada, as well as some coastal regions.",
      "In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents \u2014 in some cases accompanied by Bovino \u2014 have carried out arrests, often captured on social media videos, at Home Depot parking lots and other public areas, rounding up day laborers, landscapers and other immigrants they suspect are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The aggressive operations have fueled strong criticism from local elected officials, who have denounced Border Patrol's actions as harsh and indiscriminate, and accused agents of engaging in racial profiling, including against Hispanic U.S. citizens. Trump administration officials have rejected those accusations, saying use of force has been employed to protect agents and that arrests have been based on someone's illegal presence in the U.S., not their race.",
      "In the Charlotte area, Border Patrol agents were captured on video smashing the car window of a U.S. citizen, carrying out arrests outside of businesses and approaching men decorating a Christmas tree.",
      "Like in Chicago and Los Angeles, the operation in Charlotte triggered significant community backlash and concerns. Some businesses closed their doors temporarily. Local high school students staged walk-outs to protest the arrests. And school officials in the region reported tens of thousands of student absences.",
      "A CBS News poll released this past weekend found that 58% of Americans believed federal immigration agents were stopping and detaining \"more people than necessary.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration said it would end Temporary Protected Status for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",
      "Federal government figures indicate there are currently 3,969 people enrolled in the Myanmar TPS program. Unless a court intervenes, the program will expire in late January.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claims that the aluminum ingredients in vaccines cause a variety of harmful reactions, from allergies to autism. Scientists say that's wrong and warn of risks if they're removed.",
    "story": [
      "As the federal government prepares for the next meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has intensified his attacks on aluminum vaccine components used in many shots to boost the body's immune response.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before seeking public office, claims that aluminum adjuvants are neurotoxic and tied to autism, asthma, autoimmune disease, and food allergies.",
      "But science and medicine advances a different view. Strong recommendations that parents introduce peanut-containing foods to infants early, for instance, have led to a drop in the incidence rate of peanut allergies.",
      "Since taking office, Kennedy has ordered reviews of vaccine ingredients, citing aluminum as a top concern. A discussion of \"adjuvants and contaminants\" is on the vaccine advisory panel's draft agenda.",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0webpage that for years has assured the public vaccines do not cause autism was updated Nov. 19 with new language stating that studies have not definitively ruled out a link between vaccines and autism.",
      "He has also targeted scientists who have published studies showing aluminum adjuvants are safe. In August, Kennedy denounced a large Danish study finding no link between aluminum in vaccines and childhood disease, calling it a \"deceitful propaganda stunt\" and demanding its retraction. The Annals of Internal Medicine rejected the claim and refused to retract the study.",
      "And, regarding the upcoming advisory panel meeting, HHS spokesperson Emily HIlliard said ACIP \"is independently reviewing the full body of evidence on adjuvants and other vaccine components to ensure the highest safety standards.\"",
      "The stakes are high because Kennedy's push to cast doubt on aluminum isn't just about the ingredient itself. It's part of a broader strategy to foster uncertainty about vaccine safety and lay the groundwork to challenge the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which drug manufacturers say is essential to ensure a stable market for shots.",
      "But researchers across infectious diseases, immunology, pediatrics, and epidemiology say the data is clear: Aluminum adjuvants are safe.",
      "\"Aluminum is the third most common element on the Earth's surface,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"So we're all exposed to aluminum all the time. The water that we drink has aluminum in it. The food that we eat has aluminum in it.\"",
      "Vaccines add only a tiny amount of aluminum to the body \u2014 a combined total of about 8 milligrams \u2014 after the schedule of childhood vaccines is complete. Offit said that over the first 18 years of life, people naturally take in about 400 milligrams of aluminum from everyday sources.",
      "\"I don't know why there is so much concern,\" said Dr. Rajesh Gupta, a former FDA vaccine scientist. \"Aluminum gets distributed in the body everywhere. It is ultimately excreted by the kidneys in the urine. So, it is not that aluminum stays in the body.\"",
      "How they work",
      "The aluminum in vaccines isn't foil or metal. It's a compound of aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, that help the vaccine work better.",
      "It's a bit like zinc in cold tablets: Patients don't swallow chunks of metal, instead ingesting a zinc salt that dissolves safely in the body.",
      "In vaccines, these aluminum salts give the immune system an extra nudge so it learns to recognize the target germ more effectively.",
      "When injected, the vaccine stays near the injection site and causes mild, short-lived inflammation that summons immune cells. Those cells pick up the vaccine antigen, a harmless piece of a virus or bacterium, and carry it to nearby lymph nodes. There, the adjuvants show it around like a wanted poster so the body can identify and destroy the germ quickly.",
      "Dr. Harm HogenEsch, a professor of immunopathology at the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, said that aluminum adjuvants work only when they're injected in the same spot as the vaccine ingredient they're meant to boost, to help nearby immune cells learn to recognize the germ. If the two shots are given in different places, he said, \"you don't see that effect.\"",
      "In response to Kennedy's claims, scientists say that anything that acts as an adjuvant can, in principle, also boost an allergic response. But that doesn't mean aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are turning children into food-allergic time bombs. Antigens in vaccines such as the hepatitis B surface antigen or HPV proteins are not allergens, and no food proteins are put into vaccines.",
      "Animal experiments",
      "Animal studies form the basis of Kennedy's claim that aluminum adjuvants in vaccines can create allergies. In these experiments, scientists deliberately sensitize rats or mice by injecting them with a food protein mixed with aluminum. The aluminum strengthens the immune response, but it does not cause an allergy by itself.",
      "\"That's the basis for a lot of the experimental mouse models, where you inject a food allergen with an aluminum adjuvant to sensitize the mice,\" HogenEsch said. \"I'm not aware of any food antigen being included in vaccines, and so I don't really see a way by which this could happen.\"",
      "Dr. Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, went further, noting that there is no plausible route for vaccines to create a peanut allergy out of thin air. \"Someone would have had to mix peanut proteins in with the actual vaccine prior to injection.\"",
      "Dr. Stefan H. E. Kaufmann, director emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, said results from mice often don't match what happens in people, because \"mice are much easier to push into allergic reactions than humans.\" In other words, what looks dramatic in a rodent study doesn't automatically apply to human immune systems.",
      "And in this case, it's \"important to distinguish between how aluminum behaves in lab animals versus people,\" Kaufmann said.",
      "Human studies",
      "Beyond animal models and theoretical scenarios, scientists have looked hard for signals of harm in large human datasets.",
      "In 2023, a study by the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration coordinated by the CDC, reported a slight increase in asthma among children with higher aluminum exposure before age 2, but the association disappeared in further analyses.",
      "\"That paper was roundly criticized,\" Offit said. \"When they controlled for breastfeeding, the association between asthma and receipt of aluminum-adjuvant-containing vaccines disappeared.\"",
      "\"It should have never been published,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Kathy Edwards, professor emerita of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, said that false signals are common when large databases are mined for dozens of outcomes.",
      "\"When you look at a hundred different things, just by the law of percentages, some of those may look like there is a signal,\" she said. \"The whole RFK Jr. assessment is really prone to cherry-picking,\" she said, adding that \"there does need to be some kind of basic understanding of statistics for people to interpret this.\"",
      "Soon after the 2023 U.S. findings drew attention, scientists at the CDC contacted Dr. Anders Hviid, head of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark, to see whether his team could replicate the work.",
      "\"It makes perfect sense to try to replicate findings of any kind in different data sources,\" Hviid said.",
      "Hviid's nationwide Danish study followed 1.2 million children over two decades, using linked national health registries that record every vaccination and diagnosis.",
      "\"Our health care system is quite egalitarian. It's free, and there's universal access. And everyone is in these nationwide registers,\" he said. Their findings: no increased risk of these conditions associated with increasing amounts of aluminum received through the vaccines.",
      "Rare bumps",
      "Doctors have documented one genuine reaction to aluminum adjuvants: itchy nodules at the injection site, called \"pruritic granulomas.\" These small bumps are so rare that most allergists and pediatricians will never see a single case.",
      "This reaction \"doesn't lead to something bad, and it really isn't associated with anything other than that local irritation,\" Edwards said.",
      "Researchers believe these bumps represent a localized immune response \u2014 meaning only in the area of the injection, not a body-wide allergy \u2014 that is very different from the kind of immediate allergic reaction people treat with antihistamines. These include the reactions driven by food or beestings, when histamine, the body's own alarm signal, floods the system within minutes and causes hives, swelling, or breathing trouble. Kedl said that distinction often gets lost in public debate.",
      "Eliminating aluminum adjuvants",
      "For many experts, the real issue is not just whether aluminum is safe but what happens to the entire vaccine program if aluminum adjuvants are stripped out. For many modern vaccines that rely on a single purified protein \u2014 such as those for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, hepatitis B, and HPV \u2014 adjuvants are crucial.",
      "Edwards said that simply swapping in a different adjuvant isn't realistic.",
      "\"They're kind of all built on one another,\" she said. Once a vaccine has been proved to work and become the standard of care, new or updated versions are generally no longer tested against a placebo in people who should be getting that vaccine. Instead, they're tested against the existing product, which means each approval rests on the one before it.",
      "Core childhood vaccines would probably have to be reformulated, and large clinical trials would have to be repeated to prove the new products are safe and effective. Meanwhile, production gaps and shortages would have to be managed, potentially for years, while manufacturers and regulators start over \u2014 all while diseases such as whooping cough, hepatitis B, and HPV-related cancers gain more room to spread.",
      "\"The aluminum adjuvants have sort of hit the sweet spot in terms of being effective at inducing a robust antibody response that is protective for those vaccines in which they're being used and being very safe,\" HogenEsch said. \"It would be quite frankly foolish to try to eliminate them.\"",
      "A century of safe use",
      "The DTaP, hepatitis B, and HPV vaccines all contain aluminum adjuvants and have been in use for nearly a century. Large-scale studies show no link between aluminum and systemic allergic disease.",
      "\"We have had aluminum adjuvants in vaccines for decades,\" Edwards said. \"I have grandchildren. My grandchildren have received all of their vaccines. And I do not worry about the safety of them.\"",
      "If aluminum is falsely cast as the villain and vaccine uptake falls, experts warn, the consequences will not be theoretical: more measles in schools, more meningitis in college dorms, and more young adults dying of cancers that HPV shots could have prevented.",
      "In their view, the real danger isn't the trace amounts of a metal that children already encounter every day. It's rolling back the protection aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines have provided for generations.",
      "That's the trade-off Offit hopes parents will see. \"A choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice,\" he said. \"It's just a choice to take a different risk.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "\"I did not\u2014could not\u2014believe that they were talking about me,\" she wrote. \"I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.\"",
      "\"I had a son whom I loved more than anything and a newborn I need to take care of,\" she wrote.",
      "Schlossberg described grueling rounds of treatment including chemotherapy, several clinical trials and two bone marrow transplants, including one from her sister, Rose. But the cancer recurred, and her doctor told her he could keep her \"alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "Another tragedy hits the Kennedy family",
      "The second of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg's three children, Schlossberg said she received care at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City. She wrote searingly in her essay of the guilt she felt over another tragedy hitting the famous Kennedy family.",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she wrote.",
      "Caroline Kennedy, who served\u00a0as the U.S. ambassador to Australia and Japan, lost her father, President John F. Kennedy, when he was assassinated\u00a0on Nov. 22, 1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald \u2014 the same day, 62 years later, her daughter published her essay announcing her cancer diagnosis. She also lost her uncle Bobby Kennedy when he was shot and killed in 1968 while he was campaigning for the presidency.",
      "Caroline Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,\u00a0died in 1994 at age 64 following a diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr.,\u00a0died in a plane crash\u00a0off the coast of Massachusetts in 1999.",
      "Kennedy's cousin, Maria Shriver, urged people on social media\u00a0on Saturday to read Schlossberg's story to see what \"a beautiful writer, journalist, wife, mother, daughter, sister, and friend\" has been going through for the last year and a half. Shriver said to let the story \"be a reminder to be grateful for the life you are living today, right now, this very minute.\"",
      "Collecting memories",
      "Schlossberg spends a portion of her essay writing about her family's dismay regarding the\u00a0nomination and confirmation\u00a0of her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services. She spoke about how he cut nearly half a billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines and slashed funding from the National Institutes of Health. She wrote that hundreds of National Institute of Health grants and clinical trials were canceled.",
      "She wrote that she worries millions of women might not get the care they deserve after she was given a dose of misoprostol to stop her postpartum hemorrhage. Because the drug can also be used as part of medication abortion, it is currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration, she wrote, due to her cousin's urging.",
      "Schlossberg mostly focused on writing about her family, how she is going to miss living life with her \"kind, funny, handsome genius\" husband she managed to find, and what would happen to her two young children growing up without their mother.",
      "\"Mostly I try to live and be with them now,\" she wrote in The New Yorker. But she says that it is harder than it seems and tries to fill herself up with memories of her children, which she hopes she can carry with her after she is gone.",
      "\"Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead,\" Schlossberg wrote.",

      "Among the potential avenues discussed regarding operations for Venezuela was dropping U.S. leaflets on Caracas as a kind of psychological warfare to pressure Maduro, multiple U.S. officials familiar with the talks told CBS News.",
      "The operation, which was not yet authorized, could possibly take place Sunday, the officials said, which is Maduro's 63rd birthday.",
      "The Washington Post was first to report on the proposed leaflet operation.",
      "Over the past few months, the U.S. has ratcheted up the pressure on Maduro in multiple ways, including an extensive military buildup in the region,\u00a0live fire exercises, and strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.",
      "When asked Monday, President Trump said he wouldn't rule out sending U.S. troops into Venezuela.",
      "\"No, I don't rule out that,\" the president said. \"I don't rule out anything. We just have to take care of Venezuela.\"",
      "For his part, Maduro on the same day\u00a0said\u00a0he would be open to \"face-to-face\" discussions with Mr. Trump.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0also confirmed\u00a0that he has authorized the CIA to go into Venezuela and conduct covert operations.",
      "The Pentagon has conducted\u00a0at least 21 strikes\u00a0since early September, killing at least 80 people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the strikes are designed to target cartels and drug traffickers, although\u00a0it has not provided evidence\u00a0that the vessels struck so far were carrying drugs.",

      "Another read, \"I cannot continue to serve in such a hostile and toxic work environment.\"",
      "Amid a growing wave of firings, resignations and retirements from the Justice Department, some former agency officials are curating a public online display of the farewell messages of ousted employees. Some of the letters from purged non-political career Justice Department attorneys warn of a threat to democracy and a crumbling of the norms and standards in federal prosecutions.",
      "Justice Connection, a group of former Justice Department employees, has organized and posted the online page of goodbye messages. The organization's executive director and founder, Stacey Young, a former civil division attorney for the Justice Department, said the Justice Department purge has now eclipsed 5,000 employees since January, including resignations, firings and retirements.",
      "Some of those ousted have included high-profile department leaders, who wrote farewell messages expressing their fears about the trajectory of the Justice Department as agency employees have been purged.",
      "\"These messages are from people who are trying to encapsulate the thought of losing their careers,\" said Peter Carr, a longtime Justice Department public affairs specialist who was fired earlier this year. Carr, now a spokesperson for Justice Connection, told CBS News, \"Somebody needed to capture all of these letters, so that they're not lost to history.\"",
      "\"These messages show what is happening in our country at this moment,\" he said.",
      "One of the messages posted was written by Maurene Comey, a former New York-based federal prosecutor, who is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey and previously handled part of the criminal case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. When she was fired this year, Maureen Comey wrote, \"If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain. . . . Do not let that happen.\"",
      "\"Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought,\" she continued. \"Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns at the heart of this place.\"",

      "\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion, Scotten wrote. \"But it was never going to be me.\"",
      "Patty Hartman, who was fired in April from her communications position in the U.S. Attorney's Office for Washington, D.C., told CBS News she especially wanted to share a goodbye message with her team, because her firing was unexpected, abrupt and resulted in immediately losing access to her government-issued phone and computer.",
      "\"The people in charge who are supposed to protect us\u2014 our fellow Americans who we elected, along with those who were appointed, and swore an OATH to protect this nation and our Constitution \u2014 now use the Constitution as a weapon to suit their own ends,\" Hartman's farewell message said.",
      "\"When someone disappears from the office without notice, there's a tendency to think they did something wrong,\" Hartman told CBS News. \"It was important for me to publicly acknowledge my illegal termination because so many others were experiencing it and, quite frankly, I was pissed off.\"",
      "The Justice Department declined a request to comment to CBS News about the firings, resignations or the online farewell messages.",
      "Michael Romano, a prosecutor who handled some Jan. 6 prosecutions, noted his work on Capitol insurrection cases when he resigned in March.",
      "\"Many rioters saw their relationship with the rule of law as transactional, as they demonstrated when they told police officers that they had 'backed the blue' in the past and thus, that the officers should stand down or join the mob . . . .,\" he wrote in his message. \"They expected, in other words,\u00a0 that the rule of law did not apply to them. And, but for the work of the Capitol Siege Section, they would have been right.\"",
      "Romano told CBS News, \"It was important to have my colleagues see me standing up for the work we did. I needed to say it and people needed to hear it.\"",
      "Meredith Burrell, a former civil rights office attorney, wrote in her message, \"We were entrusted with the serious responsibility of engaging the power of the federal government to use the rule of law to vindicate the rights of marginalized people . . .\u00a0 I am still processing the contrast between those 25 years and the last four months.\"",
      "Other farewell messages are limited to praise of colleagues and law enforcement. Greg Rosen, who resigned in May after serving as the head of the unit that prosecuted Capitol riot cases, wrote in his message, \"To those who partnered with me on the January 6 investigation and prosecution: you represent the highest ideals of our nation\u2014unwavering in your commitment to the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power. To the officers who were injured, physically and emotionally, protecting the greatest legislative body in the world: thank you. You are the embodiment of heroism.\"",
      "Sybil Barksdale, a former official in the agency's Office of Violence against Women, wrote in her message, \"Throughout my career, through changing administrations, evolving legal landscapes, and countless initiatives, I had the privilege of working alongside exceptional colleagues who shared an unwavering dedication to justice and protecting those most vulnerable.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials are discussing the potential of bringing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the U.S. this week as part of President Trump's push to get an agreement on Ukraine by Thanksgiving, according to multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Whether Zelenskyy's trip happens is dependent on the outcome of peace negotiations in Geneva on Sunday, the officials said. Mr. Trump himself has described the deadline as flexible, and he told reporters on Saturday the plan was \"not my final\" proposal.",
      "Speaking from Geneva, Secretary of State Marco Rubio touted progress in discussions with a cadre of European and Ukrainian officials, but said more work would need to be done.",
      "\"I think this was a very, very meaningful \u2013 I would say probably best \u2013 meeting and day we've had so far in this entire process, going back to when we first came into office in January,\" he said. \"But there's still some work left to do and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now,\" Rubio added, promising updates after additional meetings.",
      "\"We have very good progress and we are moving forward to the just and lasting peace,\" said Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, after meeting with Rubio.",
      "There are no hard plans for a Zelenskyy visit at this moment given the active diplomacy nor are there scheduled talks with or in Russia at this point, according to a senior White House official. Another possible outcome of the negotiations in Geneva is that Army Secretary Dan Driscoll could travel to Russia or meet with Russian officials elsewhere, according to another U.S. official. Russian officials told CBS News that nothing yet is scheduled.",
      "Ukraine's response to the 28-point memo",
      "Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that her country had not agreed to all the terms in the draft 28-point peace plan that leaked to the press last week.",
      "\"This plan is not about justice and the truth of this war and the aggression,\" Stefanishyna said. \"It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.\"",
      "Stefanishyna said that Russia has not made any concessions to date and that none of the points in the leaked 28-point plan are related to forcing anything on the Russian side.",
      "In addition to the proposal, an early draft of which was leaked by an opposition politician in Ukraine and verified by the White House, there is an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Stefanishyna also confirmed that there is an additional document to the 28 points and referred to it as \"the framework of security assurances.\" She said it states the intention of the U.S. to provide something along the lines of Article 5 of the Washington NATO Treaty, such as a defense promise. However, unlike that NATO guarantee, the security assurances do not have a detailed layout of security guarantees nor the weight of Congressional approval and backing that would come with a treaty. That is a challenge for Ukraine, Stefanishyna said, in part because of past failures by the West to live up to security assurances given when Ukraine handed over its nuclear weapons as part of the 1994 Budapest memorandum.",
      "Why now?",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2013 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct. While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official",
      "said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",
      "Inter-Trump administration confusion",
      "There were separate but parallel diplomatic efforts on Ukraine taking place within the Trump administration that are now being merged.",
      "Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff have been working on what they refer to as a \"term sheet\" to end the war, mimicking their broad-strokes proposal for a Gaza ceasefire. While the Trump administration put sanctions on Russian oil and gas to bring Putin to the negotiating table, Putin advisor Kirill Dmitriev was already at a table in Miami talking to Witkoff at the end of last month.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the time dismissed Dmitriev as a \"Russian propagandist,\" but it was Dmitriev who helped draft this 28-point proposal that the U.S. is now backing. A senior White House official told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were kept \"apprised\" of those talks, which happened in Miami last month. At a time when Zelenskyy is facing a domestic political scandal at home, the Kushner-Witkoff term sheet leaked to the press via an opposition politician in Ukraine and through an interview Dmitriev did with Axios.",
      "On Saturday, a number of senators, including Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, as well as Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, said that Rubio had explained to them that the 28-point proposal was not of American origin and assured them that he personally had not heard of any threat to cut off U.S. military and intelligence sharing with Ukraine if it did not agree to terms. Rubio posted Saturday on social media that the \"plan was authored by the U.S.\"",
      "However, a Ukrainian official and a U.S. official told CBS News that the threat had been made during talks with other senior U.S. officials in Kyiv. Driscoll, a close friend of Vance's, led a delegation there last week. He's now in Geneva as part of talks.",
      "A senior White House official acknowledged to CBS News that the threat to cut off aid to Ukraine may have been implied but not explicitly stated during talks with Ukraine's leadership when U.S. officials said that Mr. Trump is getting \"weary and frustrated\" and cannot keep doing this forever.",
      "The same senior White House official told CBS News that Vance and Rubio held a call Saturday night with Driscoll and U.S. military leadership in order to answer questions from lawmakers. Rubio made additional phone calls to lawmakers, which Shaheen, King and Rounds detailed",
      "\"There are many problems with the plan as it has been reported, but the two most obvious are that it rewards Russia's illegal and unprovoked aggression by handing over substantial portions of Ukraine's sovereign territory, and its security guarantees against further Russian aggression are vague and inadequate,\" Senator King said in a statement Sunday. \"I hope that after consultation with Ukraine and the Europeans, a more fair and responsible agreement will emerge.\"",
      "When did the Army become involved in diplomacy?",
      "Driscoll has been in contact with Ukrainian officials in recent weeks and was originally planning to go to Ukraine in mid-December to discuss drone technology, but he was recently asked by Mr. Trump to restart talks about a ceasefire. Driscoll's role in the talks has involved details of the security guarantees being given to Ukraine.",
      "Driscoll combined his two missions on this trip. While Driscoll was en route to Ukraine, the 28-point plan was leaked by an anti-Zelenskyy politician. After this point, the Driscoll mission was \"adjusted\" to involve the emerging diplomacy building off the leaked Kushner-Witkoff term sheet, according to multiple U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "The U.S. officials declined to discuss details of how the 28-point plan, or the additional security guarantee document have changed in the past few days.",
      "Vance has been a driving force behind the Ukraine diplomacy, according to a European diplomat and a source familiar. His close friend Driscoll has become a key conduit.",
      "Political implications",
      "The Trump administration has been reaching out in the past few days to respond to senators and congressmen including powerful, pro-Ukraine Republicans who are upset with the reported concessions being asked of Ukraine. Republican Rep Mike McCaul, chair emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, publicly acknowledged the outreach from Vance-Rubio and said he was assured it was a U.S. proposal not a Russian one.",
      "The Trump administration is sensitive to the idea of a rift between Rubio and Witkoff. It was Witkoff who engineered the August summit with Putin in Alaska.",
      "There has been much retroactive policymaking and recasting of events as we're seeing from the on camera remarks made by Rubio's old colleagues who may recall he was a Russia hawk during his Senate days. Since his time in the Senate, Vance has been consistent in arguing that Ukraine should not be a top priority for the U.S. Meanwhile, Witkoff has been trying to get Mr. Trump the deal to end the war that he so desires.",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the first session of high-stakes talks in Geneva as \"probably the most productive and meaningful meeting\" since the start of the second Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Top U.S. and Ukrainian officials said Sunday they were making progress toward ending the\u00a0Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0as they discussed a\u00a0U.S.-proposed\u00a0plan\u00a0to achieve peace despite concerns among many of Washington's European allies that the plan was far too conciliatory to Moscow.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the first session of high-stakes talks in Geneva as \"probably the most productive and meaningful meeting\" since President Trump returned to office in January.",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following their discussions.",
      "\"They reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine's sovereignty and deliver a sustainable and just peace,\" the statement read in part. \"Both sides reiterated their readiness to continue working together to secure a peace that ensures Ukraine's security, stability, and reconstruction.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram that the delegates had \"substantive conversations\" that would continue.",
      "\"It is important that there is dialogue with the American representatives, and there are signals President Trump's team is hearing us,\" he said. \"And it is important to ensure that the steps toward ending the war are effective, and that everything is workable.\"",
      "Neither Rubio nor Zelenskyy offered specific details on any changes made to the proposed plan. Rubio left Geneva to return to Washington, D.C, following Sunday's talks, according to an official from the State Department.",
      "Earlier, Mr. Trump appeared less optimistic and used a lengthy online post to blast Ukraine for a lack of gratitude for U.S. military assistance, while shying away from criticizing Russia.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0before Sunday's talks, Mr. Trump said the Ukraine-Russia war is \"a violent and terrible one that, with strong and proper U.S. and Ukrainian LEADERSHIP, would have NEVER HAPPENED.\"",
      "\"I INHERITED A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, A WAR THAT IS A LOSER FOR EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE SO NEEDLESSLY DIED. UKRAINE 'LEADERSHIP' HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA,\" he wrote. \"THE USA CONTINUES TO SELL MASSIVE $AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS TO NATO, FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UKRAINE (CROOKED JOE GAVE EVERYTHING, FREE, FREE, FREE, INCLUDING \"BIG\" MONEY!). GOD BLESS ALL THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE HUMAN CATASTROPHE! President DJT.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has set a Thursday deadline for Ukraine to respond to the plan. But he also has suggested that he could push that back if there was proof of real progress and that the plan was not his final offer.",
      "The 28-point blueprint drawn up by the U.S. sparked alarm in Kyiv and across Europe, quickly rallying Western allies around Ukraine in a push to revise the plan, which is seen as favoring Moscow. They said in a joint statement on Saturday that while the plan \"includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace,\" additional work is required. The plan acquiesces to many of Russia's demands that Ukraine has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory.",
      "After the first session, Rubio said, \"This will ultimately have to be signed off by our presidents, although I feel very comfortable about that happening given the progress we've made.\" He was joined at the talks by U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Russia will also need to approve the final peace plan, Rubio said.",
      "The head of the Ukrainian delegation, presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, also confirmed an initial session of talks had concluded and that a second meeting would soon take place.",
      "After Mr. Trump's post, Zelenskyy cheered U.S.-led efforts on security, but stressed that \"the crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war.\"",
      "\"Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump for the assistance that \u2013 starting with the Javelins \u2013 has been saving Ukrainian lives. We thank everyone in Europe, in the G7, and in the G20 who is helping us defend life. It is important to preserve the support.",
      "\"It is important not to forget the main goal \u2013 to stop Russia's war and prevent it from ever igniting again.\"",
      "\"The leadership of the United States is important, we are grateful for everything that America and President Trump are doing for security, and we remain as constructive as possible,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers said Saturday that Rubio had privately described the plan as a Russian \"wish list\" rather than a Washington-led proposal. The bipartisan group of senators held a news conference, stating that they had spoken with Rubio about the peace plan after he reached out to some of them while en route to Geneva. Independent Maine Sen. Angus King said Rubio told them the plan \"was not the administration's plan\" but a \"wish list of the Russians.\"",
      "Rubio on Saturday night rejected the claims,\u00a0writing\u00a0in a social media post that, \"The peace proposal was authored by the U.S. It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations. It is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott denied their account, calling it \"blatantly false.\"",
      "\"As Secretary Rubio and the entire Administration has consistently maintained, this plan was authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians,\" he posted on social media.",
      "A senior U.S. official told CBS News in a statement Saturday night that the Trump administration has \"consistently maintained\" that the peace plan was authored by the U.S. with input from Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"This plan has always been a hopeful start to continued negotiations, and eventually the signing of a final peace agreement once and for all,\" the statement said.",

      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "As Americans prepare to kick off the holiday season with Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, our new poll out today underscores that their focus is still very much on the economy and high prices, with more than three-quarters of Americans who are judging Trump on the economy saying he is not spending enough time focused on the economy and inflation.",
      "Overall, his approval rating has dropped to its lowest this year. Only 40 percent of Americans now approve of Mr. Trump's job performance.",
      "The Trump administration is facing other challenges that they're dealing with right now, what their strategy is for further military action in Venezuela, negotiating an end to the war on Ukraine, and now disturbing rhetoric that's led to an increase in threats against some lawmakers, with some of that rhetoric coming from the president's social media feed.",
      "And we're joined here in studio by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow, who is one of the six lawmakers who released a recorded video earlier last week urging service members to defy illegal and unlawful orders.",
      "Good morning.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-Colorado): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it was that video that prompted some of this rhetoric from the president.",
      "I want to speak, though, about what's happening right now. I understand there was a bomb threat against your office in Aurora, Colorado, that your family has received painful death threats, even murder threats. Here is some of what your office released.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These, I believe, are phone calls that were made to your office. Are any of these threats credible?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We don't know, Margaret.",
      "We're going to take these seriously. But it's very disturbing stuff. When you have the president of the United States threatening to execute and to hang and to arrest using this rhetoric, people listen to it. We have seen before a pattern of inciteful, dangerous rhetoric being used by the president and then people acting on that.",
      "I lived through an experience January 6, a very similar dynamic. He's been doing this for years, saying things, and in total disregard for the outcome and what might happen when he throws this stuff out in the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president has made these social media posts, but then he then sort of walked some of those threats back, saying he wasn't threatening death. He was saying sedition was often in the past punishable by death.",
      "And then, before you appeared here today on social media, he put out: \"The traitors that told the military to disobey my orders should be in jail right now, not roaming the fake news networks\" \u2013 I guess that's us \u2013 \"trying to explain what they said was OK. It wasn't and never will be. It was sedition at the highest level. It's a major crime. There can be no other interpretation of what they said.\"",
      "That's a quote from what he put on social media.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any idea what all these threats actually mean? Because he mentioned in an interview military courts and referenced the DOJ as well.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: No, we don't know what this means. He doesn't know what this means, because he's irresponsible. He's acting dangerous. He's acting in an inciteful way.",
      "There's two things going on here, Margaret. One is the irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric by the president of the United States, threatening to have members of Congress executed who he disagrees with.",
      "But it's also so telling that, when members of Congress simply remind service members of the Constitution and their duty to obey the law, which is not just our right, but is our obligation to do, that he cannot handle that and he resorts the threats of violence and threats of arrest and execution.",
      "That tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump's respect for the Constitution and the rule of law and actually underscores our point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's get to the content of what you had in that video you released, because there are also 15 House Republicans who are also veterans who released a video, including a retired three-star Marine Corps general, Jack Bergman.",
      "Take a listen to this.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JACK BERGMAN (R-Michigan): Troops, listen up. Any service member who refuses a lawful order is subject to court-martial for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
      "MAN #1: We study what's lawful and what's not lawful. And the Democrats' stunt insinuating that there are illegal or unconstitutional orders, it's downright dangerous.",
      "MAN #2: It is corrosive. It is meant to weaken our country and weaken the military.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to these allegations from your colleagues, fellow veterans, that what you have put out there is weakening and corrosive to the military?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, these, unfortunately, are some of Trump's core supporters that are rallying behind the president.",
      "And they know better. They know exactly the difference between lawful versus unlawful. We were very clear in the video that what we're talking about is unlawful orders. You have the president's spokesperson going on \u2013 into a press conference this past week and saying that we called for people to disobey lawful orders.",
      "They're simply lying because the truth is unacceptable to them. It's unacceptable. We wanted to start a conversation, and we did, about the dangerous rhetoric this president is using and the threats that he's made to use our military in an unlawful way, because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically what?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, send troops into Chicago, send troops into polling stations, kill terrorists' families, arrest and execute\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He hasn't done those things.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 arrest and execute members of Congress, shoot peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square. Need I go on?",
      "He has a history of doing this. And if we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them. We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction, which is exactly what we did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So those were comments, not orders he gave, and social media posts and the like. But I hear you that words matter.",
      "But the standard for troops, as I understand it, is that they should consult with the staff judge advocate, the staff legal counsel regarding orders if they have legal questions. There is a process in place.",
      "Are you telling the rank-and-file troops to go outside of that practice?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: No, absolutely not.",
      "Let me use an example of how this plays out and what this looks like downrange, as we say in the military. I did three\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, because it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on those people downrange.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I did three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "And before each of those combat deployments, I sat my soldiers down, my Paratroopers and my Rangers, and we talked about the law of war. We talked about lawful versus unlawful orders, about the protection of civilians in conflict, right, because you can't wait until a soldier is in the moment and has to make a split-second decision about what to do to train them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You have to talk about it. You have to train them before, which was why we put this video out, to get people thinking about their obligation and all of the threats and all of the things the president have said would be manifestly unlawful and would be the types of orders that people shouldn't carry through, because they would be murder if people actually did the things that Donald Trump threatened.",
      "So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we don't know yet that the deployment of troops on U.S. soil, if you were referring to the National Guard deployments in major U.S. cities, is actually unlawful. That's tied up in the courts right now.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We're talking about the decision of troops on the ground out in operations, right, their interface with civilians, shooting civilians, going to polling stations, which is a violation of U.S. criminal law, things that are man\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these things haven't happened. You're afraid they will?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 things that are manifestly unlawful that our troops might be put in the position to carry out because that has what \u2013 that is what the president has repeatedly threatened to do.",
      "So, again, it's very telling that simply restating their obligation to the Constitution and the law\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 which we do constantly with our service members, gets this type of response from the president.",
      "I am not going to be threatened and intimidated by the president of the United States. I have a job to do, and that is to ensure people follow the law. I took an oath to this country. It is a lifetime oath that I intend to carry out. And I am not going to be intimidated and threatened by the president and stop reminding people to follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "But I have talked to lawyers about this, and military lawyers about this, and there is some frustration that lawmakers haven't been in Washington doing their job in terms of oversight. There aren't hearings on Venezuela. There aren't hearings on those deployments of the National Guard.",
      "And yet there are public videos calling on troops at low ranks to make decisions unto themselves here about what is lawful or unlawful or recall their training or talk to their staff judge advocate about this.",
      "I mean, this \u2013 why not first publicly call for a hearing before you call on the troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, first of all, two separate issues.",
      "So, on the hearing, absolutely right. We are pushing the Trump administration to actually give us briefings, give us hearings. Mike Johnson, Speaker Johnson, shut Congress down twice, twice, to avoid votes on releasing the Epstein files.",
      "They have\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He would argue Democrats shut down Congress to \u2013 for the health care argument.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, it's very clear \u2013 it's very clear what they did.",
      "I still came to D.C. anyhow and pushed for oversight and pushed for briefings. So I have been in Congress for seven years almost, and I have never seen the lack of briefings and oversight and ability to access information. I have been completely shut out of the DOD and the CIA at this point, as a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee.",
      "So, this administration\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't so much of this because of the Republican leadership in Congress that isn't demanding those things?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This \u2013 exactly right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Congress has the power to do this. So they're right. We need to be doing this. Democrats are trying to do it. We are being stonewalled and blocked by the Republicans, blocked by the administration, because they actually don't want us to do the oversight, because they're afraid of what we're going to learn.",
      "And that is different, Margaret, than what we're talking about, operational decisions, decisions to go to war in the Caribbean, Venezuela, which are strictly within the purview of Congress. And Congress needs to be making those decisions and debating it, versus\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 the White House says that was not an act of war; it's foreign policy and the president has a lot of leeway under the Constitution. That's their argument.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, we have been hearing this for 25 years, which is why Iraq and Afghanistan went on for as long as it did. We spent $3 trillion, lost 7,000 service members' lives, and those ended poorly.",
      "Congress has to make that decision. Congress needs to be accountable for it. And Congress needs to be debating this before the American people, going to the American people, and telling them why they should send their sons and daughters into conflict and they should spend hundreds of billions of dollars of their hard-earned money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This president doesn't want that process to happen.",
      "And as somebody that did three combat tours in these wars\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 I have had enough of Congress being cut out of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will see in some of our upcoming polling data that the American public would like more information about the plans for Venezuela, which you were referencing there.",
      "Congressman Crow, thank you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who joins us from Tucson, Arizona.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Senator.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-Arizona): Thank you for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up where we left off on this topic of political violence.",
      "I know your family has suffered because of it, very, very directly. And then, this past week, the president called that video you participated in sedition. You heard me read what he said again this morning, sedition at the highest level and a major crime.",
      "Have you \u2013 do you have credible threats? How concerned are you about your security at this point?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, Margaret, what the president said is very serious.",
      "I didn't think he would step over the \u2013 over that line, calling for the execution of members of Congress. And his words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that.",
      "And because of what he says, there is now an \u2013 increased threats against us. I'm not going to get into details on my personal security. But, as the husband of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, we \u2013 I understand what political violence is. The president should as well.",
      "Just like Gabby, somebody tried to assassinate him, and should \u2013 he should understand that his words have \u2013 you know, could have serious, serious consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I remember just weeks ago hearing from the president and other Republicans about the need to dial back the rhetoric after the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk.",
      "When it comes to your\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes, what happened to that? I mean, that was two months ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Where are they now? We've heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the president has said about hanging members of Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I \u2013 that's what I wanted to ask you. Why aren't we hearing from your Republican colleagues?",
      "And, in terms of your security, I understand there was a request for you to get a boost in Capitol Hill security support. Are Republican members on board with that?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I don't know. I have heard them say, you know, very little about this.",
      "I think, you know, the president tries to intimidate them. He tries to intimidate Congress. He looks at government accountability as a nuisance. And I think it's really important for people to understand, Margaret, that the message he sent a couple days ago was, he declared that loyalty to the Constitution is now punishable by death.",
      "Those are serious words coming from the president of the United States. He's trying to intimidate us.",
      "But, Margaret, I'm not going to be intimidated. You know, you just heard Jason Crow. He's not going to be intimidated either. We both served our country. We swore an oath. All we said is, we reiterated what basically is the rule of law\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

And now the government has confirmed it; 48 percent of current detainees lack criminal charges or convictions.",
      "Since President Trump took office, the number of noncriminal detainees arrested by ICE has increased by over 2000 percent. Our new CBS poll shows that 54 percent of Americans believe the government is stopping and detaining more people than necessary.",
      "A similar number, 55 percent, now disapprove of President Trump's handling of immigration policy. Despite growing public concern, the administration has recently expanded enforcement operations to Charlotte and other cities, giving no sign their so-called mass deportation campaign is ending any time soon.",

      "For more from our latest CBS News poll we're now joined by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, it's always great to have you here.",
      "It's the time of year where Americans go out and they spend a whole lot of money because they're getting ready for the holidays. So, how are people feeling about the economy?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: The story of the economy is a story about prices, as it has been for years. And people say prices are still high. Not going down. In fact, many say they're still going up. And it's a reminder that even as we talk about inflation and the macro inflation rate of change numbers, this is people walking down the aisle in a grocery store and saying, that's expensive or that's not. And simple as that is what you pick up in a poll.",
      "Now, the other part of this is about expectations, which is, at the start of this year people told us that they thought the economy was going to get better, that prices were going to come down. So, you see this sort of realization here that it is not. That's number two.",
      "But the other part of this is, as it comes back to those numbers you mentioned for the president, and his ratings for all of this. First of all, what people say they're hearing from the White House doesn't match with what they are feeling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: They say the president is making the inflation issue sound better than it really is.",
      "Now, look, some of that is just going to be any president trying to be optimistic, right? Maybe that's Trump being Trump, putting something positive out there. But, a the same time, you look at people who say they judge the president, first and foremost, on how he handles the economy, and the big majority of them say his administration is not spending enough time on it. So, it's not just about the rhetoric, it's also about the action.",
      "Now, the other part of this is, when you look at the decline in his approval ratings on handling the economy, it's kind of slow and steady down to this point, which comes back to those expectations, which is that people sort of comparing what they expected to what they're seeing now. And that's a big reason why his handling for it has slowly gone down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pocketbook politics always so important.",
      "The other big policy for this president has been immigration. And his supporters have stuck by him on that. How is he fairing?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Very much so. Still very strong support from the Republican base. That's right. And relatively better than he does on the economy.",
      "But speaking of the economy, there's an economic component to this too, which is, people say that the deportation program is more likely to be hurting the economy right now, making it weaker, than making it stronger. So, you go a little \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's harder to find workers?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, you go a little bit into that, right? And people say \u2013 the ones who say that they feel like it's impacting the area around them, and the ones who say they think that is for the worse, say their sense of thing is that people are staying home more as a result of this. Not necessarily going out. And so one of the things you see there is the potential or the perception of an economic impact out of the deportation program, although, yes, it still maintains strong support from Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Different topic but related. The White House is preparing for some kind of military action against Venezuela, and the president has linked this to both drug policy and immigration policy because of those Venezuelan refugees who have been coming into this country in recent years.",
      "We have lawmakers saying, not enough information is being shared. Does the public think they know what's happening?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: The public is echoing exactly that sentiment, right? You get this big majority that says the administration has not yet explained what the U.S. position is, what is going on there. But then, on the other side of that, that it needs to. And even across the board, Republicans, Democrats, independent, all saying that it needs to.",
      "Now, the reason then that you'd see, as we see, this big number that say they would oppose military action in Venezuela is that that connection hasn't been made, right? So, people don't feel like they know what's going on. So you see that opposition, at least in general.",
      "The other part is, you compare that to relatively larger approval for the idea of, or the attacks on, boats and ships that the administration says are carrying drugs. That gets a little higher approval. But at the same time, you still see people saying, the administration should show evidence that there are drugs on that boat. So, it comes back to that idea of people wanting to know more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bring the public along with you in the decisions you're making.",
      "You also have been looking at the president's base, MAGA. How are they feeling and how does this idea of intervention, some kind of action overseas, settle with them? Because the president had promised America first focus at home.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right now, with regard to Venezuela, you see the MAGA Republicans, so identify as MAGA Republicans, even more supportive than non-MAGA Republicans at the idea. Why is that? Number one, they do see it as tied to drugs. They're more likely to say, if we were to go in there, that it might stop the flow of drugs into the U.S. So, they are listening to what the president is arguing, number one.",
      "Number two, for context, we have often seen MAGA Republicans more differential to the president across a range of issues, including foreign policy ones. So, we say on the Iran strikes, as well as others. And what I think what we see is, when they say America first, what they're saying is, look out for U.S. interests, number one. Not necessarily be entirely isolationist. But that deference to the president, among the MAGA base, has been something consistent throughout this. It is still very much about him and his connection to that MAGA base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, great insights. Thank you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Welcome back to the program, Senator.",
      "A lot to get to.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-KY): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on this concern about political violence, or angry rhetoric. I know the president himself has survived these two attempts on his life. You've talked to us about those risks to him. And then we had this killing of Charlie Kirk just a few months ago. Is the president holding himself to the same standards that he is asking of others when it comes to dialing back dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, you know, everybody knows that the president is famous for his unfiltered social media. But if you take at face value the idea that calling your opponents traitors and then specifically saying that it warrants the death penalty, is reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible. There are a number of other ways to describe it, but it's not something that is helping the country heal wounds. I think it stirs things up. And, really, I think we can do better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the homeland security front, I understand you are chair of that committee and so you have some insight into some of these domestic threats. It's not just these Democratic lawmakers. We saw out in the state of Indiana, four Republican state senators were targeted by swatting threats amid President Trump's pubic pressure on them to redistrict their state. Just a few weeks ago we did see one of the convicted January 6th rioters, who was then pardoned by President Trump, arrested for threatening to kill Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. I mean are we at the point here where it's not just unfiltered social media posts, but truly dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, you know, I've been on the receiving side of this. Even my father, who's been retired for some time, has been on the receiving end of swatting. Police are called, says there's an emergency in the home. And the goal is to, you know, have someone draw a gun and be killed as the police come in supposedly to rescue someone who's not really in need of being rescued. So, I think both sides have been doing this. And I think the language on treason and traitors, both to Republicans and Democrats, is, as I said, reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that \u2013 so one of the other developments we've seen just over the weekend is that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican from Georgia, just a staunch supporter for so long of the president, has said she is going to step away because she's paid such a public price for some of her positions. Do you think there is room in your party for disagreeing with President Trump?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think it's important that we have independent voices. So, I'm sad to see her voice go away, or potentially go away. I think that she brought up something in the last week or so that was very important, what is the Republican plan for health care? So, I've engaged the president on this and I'm putting forward my own plan. But in my plan what it allows for is people to buy their insurance through a collective. Basically to by their insurance through Costco or Sam's Club or Amazon. And mine is the only plan out there that would actually drive prices down. But that's what an independent voice will help in our country, an independent voice within the Republican caucus, not to see things always inside the box, but to think of some out of the box solutions. So, I think independent voices are important in the Republican Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because of your position on homeland security, you may have some insight into the drug cartels. You are also on Senate Foreign Relations. And it is tomorrow that the Trump administration officially will designate the cartel de la Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. That's the cartel the Trump administration says is linked to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Secretary Hegseth says it gives the administration new tools. Nothing's on or off the table he says militarily. Legally, what changes tomorrow? What becomes possible?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think by doing this they're pretending as if we are at war. They're pretending as if they've gotten some imprimatur to do what they want. When you have war, the rules of engagement are lessened. So, for example, we normally don't shoot boats that we suspect of being drug dealers. In fact, if the Coast Guard tomorrow started shooting all vessels that are off of Miami or off of San Diego, about one in four of the vessels that they normally board doesn't have drugs. So, it actually would be unlawful if the Coast Guard started blowing up boats. But for some reason they say, oh, we're at war off the coast of Venezuela. And so it's a different rule of engagement. It's one of war.",
      "But, you know, Senator Kaine and I brought this up. And we said, if it's war, let's declare it as war. Let's have this discussion. Is it war or not? And the administration refused that. They want to have it both ways. They want to say, oh, we can just say these people are terrorists, they're narco terrorists, so we can blow them up. But it's extraordinary that when some of them survive, they pluck them out of the water, they don't prosecute them for drugs, they don't collect drugs, they don't tell us if they were armed or not. They just send them back to their country, most of the time not being Venezuela. They've sent one back to Colombia and one back to Ecuador. But nobody's making any pretense of even interviewing them to find out who's selling you the drugs. Maybe we could find out who the kingpins are if they're involved in the drug trade. Not a word.",
      "And I've been given zero, not one briefing because I'm skeptical of what they're doing. They don't brief me or the general Senate at all. A few hand-select people may have gotten a briefing, but I have not been invited to any briefings on Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's fairly unusual given your homeland security role and that the premise for some of this action has to do with both immigration and drug policy according to the president.",
      "I know the DEA administrator recently spoke to our Nicole Sganga and told her that they have seen between a 30 to 45 percent increase in cocaine prices per kilogram due to these DOD boat strikes, and a shift towards land routes for delivery of those drugs.",
      "In other words, there's still demand for the drugs, and the cartels are just finding different routes to deliver them. Have you seen any evidence that the president's actions to date are winning a drug war?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I think we should be trying to work on the demand side, treating it as a health problem, as an addiction problem in our country, and trying to lessen the demand. And that is part of the overall solution.",
      "The war on drugs, though, to capture all the people selling drugs, the price goes up and more people are attracted to it.",
      "You know, a couple of the people that have been identified as being on these boats are simply down on their luck, people with no prospects who were offered $500 to get on a boat and race across the ocean. And so, there always will be those people. There's probably a limitless number of those people in South America.",
      "There's been some benefit when we've cooperated with countries and with governments, but that's not what this is. And I fear that this is not going to do anything for the drug trade, but it is really going against the rule of law in the way in which we interact with people on the high seas. And it has no precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I've seen you quoted as saying there are people in the administration who have wanted to go to war in Venezuela for some time. Who are you talking about?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think it's clear that Senator Rubio, as a senator, was very much an advocate of regime change. This was at odds, really, with President Trump. And so, when he was picked, a lot of people who had been supportive of President Trump were, oh my goodness, they're picking someone much more hawkish and much more eager to be involved and to intervene in other countries. And so people worried.",
      "And then the first year or so people are like, oh, well, Rubio's doing a good job on foreign aid and they've cut back on all of the abuse of these NGOs around the world. And I think that people supporting the president have been very supportive of the secretary of state. But I think once there's an invasion of Venezuela, or if they decide to re-up the subsidies and the gifts to Ukraine, I think you'll see a splintering and a fracturing of the movement that has supported the president because I think a lot of people, including myself, were attracted to the president because of his reticence to get us involved in foreign war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, to date, they say nothing on or off the table. No specifics. We'll continue to track all the reporting on that.",
      "Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time today.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand this is a very intense week for your country for a number of reasons, including the diplomacy that's happening right now as we sit here in Geneva. Your president said Ukraine face as choice between losing its dignity or losing a key ally, the United States. What has been agreed to at this point?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, as it is known, the consultation are still ongoing between Ukraine and the American officials. This is Secretary of State Rubio and also Secretary of Army Driscoll, who arrived a little bit earlier. This consultation are still continue on the basis of the proposal of the American side on 28-point peace plan, as it's been called here. And European allies are also present in Geneva these days to work hand in hand with Ukraine in the litigation, but also with the American delegation to discuss the proposals on our \u2013 and on their side. So, consultations are still ongoing. But there has been a number of points, which have been already widely discussed in public.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you aware of Russia making any concessions at this point?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, it is not seen this way from the proposal, which is on the table. In fact \u2013 in fact, none of the points are actually related to forcing anything on the Russian side. Of course, it's recognized that it is \u2013 it is aggression. There is a number of points related to return of hostages and a \u2013 and a prisoners of war, of a humanitarian nation. But this is definitely not about justice. This plan is not about the justice. And the truth of this war and the aggression. It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's unfair to Ukraine, you're saying?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, again, I think this should be divided. This plan is not about justice, you know. And this plan is about a number of actions proposed as part of estimated agreement between Ukraine and potentially Russian Federation. Ukraine is in intensive engagement in a very constructive way with the American side. And under the umbrella of U.S. leadership, the discussions are ongoing and we believe that the fair piece is not the words, but this is something that should be put on paper. So, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you been told that the United States will cut off military and intelligence sharing if President Zelenskyy doesn't agree to this plan by Thursday?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: I think it's totally unfair to American colleagues and partners to call (ph) this or that statement, which were wait (ph) \u2013 where were done in course of, you know, various meetings and a phone calls. There was quite a few, you know. We had a first senior military visit to Ukraine by Secretary of Army Driscoll since we gained the independence in 1991. And I had meeting with him as well here in Washington. And his role is extremely \u2013 extremely clear to us. We also had an engagement between president and the vice president on a the phone call. There was like a lot of discussions. Some of them were more emotional. Some were less emotional. But here we are. We are sitting together and looking for a solution to end the war. And Russia is not part of the process formally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that in addition to those 28 points there's a separate document that has to do with security guarantees. I have also been told that there's a separate document with security guarantees.",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Journal\" is reporting that it's ten years of support but it doesn't commit the U.S. to provide direct military assistance. What guarantees do you want from the United States?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, there is a separate document called the framework. Like, of the security assurances from the United States. So, this is not the agreement. This is not the treaty. This is not the formal or detailed layout for what security guarantees is \u2013 that is the \u2013 like documents specifying the intention that U.S. government is committed to providing security assurances, which are like something like the Article Five of the Washington NATO treaty.",
      "So, it's still very different and it specifies \u2013 it's been in the public access. So, it's been publicly leaked as well. So, that U.S. will stand up together with their allies in case of the Russian aggression from the territory of the Russian Federation.",
      "I think we should not forget that the Russian aggression start, in fact, from Bella Russian territory. So, they're like a lot of nuances and this needs to be discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, I see. So, you're saying you want a clear security guarantee that says if you're invaded or if you're attacked, including by surrounding countries that are Russian proxies, you want America to say that it will come to Ukraine for that (ph)?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Another of a different situations where we have learned our lessons, and we face the aggression for three and a half years and we learned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you, U.S. and European officials tell me that the trajectory on the battlefield for Ukraine is not good, particularly in that key industrial city of Pokrovsk.",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Pokrovsk, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pokrovsk. And that Russia will likely take control of this, and that this is sort of a gateway to the eastern part, the Donbas. How do you respond to the argument that Ukraine is losing on the battlefield and that you need to negotiate now?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, Ukraine is one of the largest European countries. And on a regular, within one week there are more than 1,000 combat (ph) engagements happening on all the front line. And the Russia has tried to present that it's only happen in Pokrovsk, right? So, this is a victorious narrative Russia is using as a tactics of pressuring or changing the reality also here in the United States. That's why, I mean, Pokrovsk is a very important spot on the front line but definitely not the only one.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Olga Stefanishyna. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Welcome, Margaret, hello.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand this is a very intense week for your country for a number of reasons, including the diplomacy that's happening right now as we sit here in Geneva. Your president said Ukraine faces a choice between losing its dignity or losing a key ally, the United States. What has been agreed to at this point?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well as- as it is known, the consultation are still ongoing between Ukraine and the American officials. This is Secretary of State Rubio, and also Secretary of Army Driscoll, who arrived a little bit earlier. These consultations are still continue on the basis of the proposal of the American side on 28 point peace plan, as it's been called here. And European allies are also present in Geneva these days to work hand in hand with the Ukrainian delegation, but also with the American delegation to discuss the proposals on our and on their side. So the consultations are still ongoing, but there has been a number of points which have been already widely discussed in public.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you aware of Russia making any concessions at this point?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well, it does not seem this way from the proposal which is on the table. In fact- in fact, none of the points are actually related to- to forcing anything on the Russian side. Of course, it's recognized that it is- it is aggression. There is a number of points related to return of hostages and- and prisoners of war, of a humanitarian nation. But this is definitely not about the justice. This plan is not about the justice and the truth of this war and- and the aggression. It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's unfair to Ukraine, you're saying.",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well again, I think this should be divided. This plan is not about justice, you know, and this plan is about a number of actions proposed as part of estimated agreement between Ukraine and potentially Russian Federation. Ukraine is in intensive engagement in a very constructive way with the American side and under the umbrella of U.S. leadership, these discussions are ongoing, and we believe that the fair peace is not the words, but this is something that should be put on paper. So, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you been told that the United States will cut off military and intelligence sharing if President Zelenskyy doesn't agree to this plan by Thursday?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: I think it's- it's totally unfair to- to American colleagues and partners to quote this or that statements which were weighed- which were done in course of, you know, various meetings and phone calls. There was quite a few, you know, we had a first senior military visit to Ukraine by Secretary of Army Driscoll since- since we gained the independence in 1991. And I had a meeting with him as well here in Washington. And his role is extremely- extremely clear to us. We also had an engagement between president and vice president on a phone call. There was, like, a lot of discussions. Some of them were more emotional. Some were- them were less emotional, but here we are. We are sitting together and looking for a solution to end the war, and Russia is not part of this process formally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the- the Wall Street Journal is reporting that in addition to those 28 points, there's a separate document that has to do with security guarantees. I have also been told that there's a separate document with security guarantees.",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Journal is reporting that it's 10 years of support, but it doesn't commit the U.S. to provide direct military assistance. What guarantees do you want from the United States?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well, there is a separate document called the framework, like of the security assurances from the United States. So this is not the agreement. This is not the treaty. This is not the- the- the formal or detailed layout of what security guarantees is. That is the like document specifying the intention that U.S. government is committed to providing security assurances, which are like something like the Article 5 of the Washington NATO Treaty. So it's- it's still very different, and it specifies it's been in a public access so it's been publicly leaked as well, so, that U.S. will stand up together with the allies, in case of the Russian aggression from the territory of the Russian Federation. I think we should not forget that the Russian aggression started, in fact, from Belarusian territory. So they're, like, a lot of nuances, and this is to be discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, I see. So you're saying you want a clear security guarantee that says if you're invaded, or if you're attacked, including by surrounding countries that are Russian proxies. You want America to say that it will come to Ukraine's defense?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Yeah, absolutely. We can really speak about security assurances where we have, like the real document in front of our eyes and what is really important that we had- we are very complicated partner for U.S., because we also had a lot of different sad experiences, like Budapest Memorandum where we gave up nuclear weapons that we had, another of different situations where we have learned our lessons and we face the aggression for three and a half year and we learned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you. U.S. and European officials tell me that the trajectory on the battlefield for Ukraine is not good, particularly in that key industrial city of Pokrovsk --",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: -- Pokrovsk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pokrovsk. And that Russia will likely take control of this, and that this is sort of a gateway to the eastern part, that the Donbas. How do you respond to the argument that Ukraine is losing on the battlefield and that you need to negotiate now?",

    "summary": "Sen. Mark Kelly criticized President Trump for his recent comments accusing a group of Democratic lawmakers of \"seditious behavior.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona criticized President Trump for his recent comments, in which the president accused him and other Democratic lawmakers of \"seditious behavior,\" with Kelly saying Mr. Trump should understand that his words \"could have serious, serious consequences.\"",
      "\"His words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that, and because of what he says, there is now increased threats against us,\" Kelly said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Democrats have railed against the president in recent days after he posted Thursday on social media that a group of lawmakers who urged members of the military to disobey illegal orders should be arrested and face trial for \"seditious behavior.\" In another post, Mr. Trump also said \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" He also reposted \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\"",
      "The president's posts came in response to a video featuring Kelly and Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, along with Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire. In the video, the lawmakers, who are veterans and former national security officials, cited threats to the Constitution while urging service members and members of the intelligence community to \"refuse illegal orders.\"",
      "Crow, who appeared separately on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said that the video referred to orders that are \"manifestly unlawful, that our troops might be put in the position to carry out, because that is what the president has repeatedly threatened to do.\"",
      "Crow listed several examples of what he considered to be unlawful orders, like threatening to send troops into Chicago or to polling stations.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday the president does not want to execute members of Congress. And Mr. Trump clarified on Fox News Radio Friday that \"I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble. In the old days, it was death. That was seditious behavior.\" Then, late Saturday, the president again railed against the lawmakers in a post on Truth Social, saying the lawmakers who made the video \"SHOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW.\"",
      "\"IT WAS SEDITION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL, AND SEDITION IS A MAJOR CRIME,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Kelly said the president is \"trying to intimidate us.\"",
      "\"I'm not going to be intimidated,\" he said, noting that Crow, who also appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" is \"not going to be intimidated either.\"",
      "\"We both served our country,\" Kelly said. \"We swore an oath. All we said is we reiterated what basically is the rule of law. Members of the military should not, cannot follow illegal orders.\"",
      "Kelly's wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was shot at a political event in 2011, and he noted that \"as the husband of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, I understand what political violence is.\"",
      "\"The president should as well,\" Kelly said, referring to the July 2024 assassination attempt in which a bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"Just like Gabby, somebody tried to assassinate him, and he should understand that his words, have you know, could have serious, serious consequences.\"",
      "Crow, whose district office reported a bomb threat late Saturday, said he didn't know yet whether the threat was credible, but he said it's \"very disturbing stuff.\"",
      "\"When you have the president of the United States threatening to execute and to hang and to arrest using this rhetoric, people listen to it,\" Crow said. \"We've seen before a pattern of insightful, dangerous rhetoric being used by the president, and then people acting on that.\"",
      "The Colorado Democrat cited his experience of the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, calling it a \"very similar dynamic.\"",
      "\"He's been doing this for years,\" Crow said. \"Saying things in total disregard for the outcome and what might happen when he throws this stuff out in the world.\"",
      "Crow said on top of the \"irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric,\" it's also \"so telling that when members of Congress simply remind service members of the Constitution and their duty to obey the law, which is not just our right, but is our obligation, to do that, he cannot handle that, and he resorts to threats of violence and threats of arrest and execution.\"",
      "\"That tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump's respect for the Constitution and the rule of law,\" Crow said.",
      "The veterans and former national security officials wanted to \"start a conversation\" about \"the dangerous rhetoric this president is using and the threats that he's made to use our military in an unlawful way,\" Crow said.",
      "\"If we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them,\" he added. \"We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction which is exactly what we did.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Welcome back to the program, Senator. A lot to get to, but on this concern about political violence or angry rhetoric, I know the President himself has survived these two attempts on his life. You talked to us about those risks to him. And then we had this killing of Charlie Kirk just a few months ago. Is the President holding himself to the same standard that he is asking of others when it comes to dialing back dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: You know, everybody knows that the President is famous for his unfiltered social media. But if you take at face value the idea that calling your opponents traitors and then specifically saying that it warrants the death penalty is reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible, there are a number of other ways to describe it, but it's not something that is helping the country heal wounds. I think it stirs things up and- and really, I think we can do better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the homeland security front, I understand you are chair of that committee, and so you have some insight into some of these domestic threats. It's not just these Democratic lawmakers. We saw out in the state of Indiana, four Republican state senators were targeted by swatting threats amid President Trump's public pressure on them to redistrict their state. Just a few weeks ago, we did see one of the convicted January 6 rioters who was then pardoned by President Trump arrested for threatening to kill Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Are we at the point here where it's not just unfiltered social media posts, but truly dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Well, you know, I've been on the receiving side of this. Even my father, who's been retired for some time, has been on the receiving end of swatting. Police are called. Says there's an emergency in the home, and the goal is to, you know, have someone draw a gun and be killed as the police come in, supposedly to rescue someone who's not really in need of being rescued. So, I think both sides have been doing this, and I think the language on treason and traitors, both to Republicans and Democrats, is, as I said, reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that- so one of the other developments we've seen just over the weekend is that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican from Georgia, just a staunch supporter for so long of the President, has said she is going to step away because she's paid such a public price for some of her positions. Do you think there is room in your party for disagreeing with President Trump?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: I think it's important that we have independent voices. So, I'm sad to see her voice go away, or potentially go away. I think that she brought up something in the last week or so that was very important. What is the Republican plan for health care? So, I've engaged the President on this, and I'm putting forward my own plan. But in my plan, what it allows for is people to buy their insurance through a collective. Basically to buy their insurance through Costco or Sam's Club or Amazon. And mine is the only plan out there that would actually drive prices down. But that's what an independent voice will help in our country. Independent voice within the Republican caucus, not to see things always inside the box, but to think of some out of the box solutions. So, I think independent voices are important in the Republican Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because of your position on Homeland Security, you may have some insight into the drug cartels. You are also on Senate Foreign Relations, and it is tomorrow that the Trump administration officially will designate the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. That's the cartel the Trump administration says is linked to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Secretary Hegseth, says it gives the administration new tools. Nothing's on or off the table, he says, militarily. Legally, what changes tomorrow? What becomes possible?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: I think by doing this, they're pretending as if we are at war. They're pretending as if they've gotten some imprimatur to do what they want. When you have war, the rules of engagement are lessened. So, for example, we normally don't shoot boats that we suspect of being drug dealers. In fact, if the Coast Guard tomorrow started shooting all vessels that are off of Miami or off of San Diego, about one in four of the vessels that they normally board doesn't have drugs. So it actually would be unlawful if the Coast Guard started blowing up boats. But for some reason they say, oh, we're at war off the coast of Venezuela. And so it's different rule of engagement. It's one of war. But you know, Senator Kaine and I brought this up, and we said, if it's war, let's- let's declare it as war. Let's have this discussion. Is it war or not? And the administration refused that. They want to have it both ways. They want to say, Oh, we can just say these people are terrorists, are narco-terrorists, so we can blow them up. But it's extraordinary that when some of them survive, they pluck them out of the water. They don't prosecute them for drugs. They don't collect drugs. They don't tell us if they were armed or not. They just send them back to their country, most of the time, not being Venezuela. They've sent one back to Colombia and one back to Ecuador, but nobody's making any pretense of even interviewing them to find out who's selling you the drugs. Maybe we could find out who the kingpins are if they're involved in the drug trade. Not a word. And I've been given zero, not one briefing, because I'm skeptical of what they're doing. They don't brief me or the general Senate at all. A few hand selected people may have gotten a briefing, but I have not been invited to any briefings on Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's fairly unusual, given your homeland security role, and that the premise for some of this action has to do with both immigration and drug policy, according to the President. I know the DEA administrator recently spoke to our Nicole Sganga and told her that they have seen between a 30% to 45% increase in cocaine prices per kilogram due to these DoD boat strikes and a shift towards land routes for delivery of those drugs. In other words, there's still demand for the drugs and the cartels are just finding different routes to deliver them. Have you seen any evidence that the President's actions to date are winning a drug war?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I think we should be trying to work on the demand side, treating it as a health problem, as an addiction problem in our country, and trying to lessen the demand. And that is part of the overall solution, the war on drugs, though, to capture all the people selling drugs. The price goes up and more people are attracted to it. You know, a couple of the people that have been identified as being on these boats are simply down on their luck, people with no prospects who are offered $500 to get on a boat and race across the ocean, and so there always will be those people. There's probably a limitless number of those people in South America. There's been some benefit when we've cooperated with countries and with governments. But that's not what this is, and I fear that this is not going to do anything for the drug trade, but it is really going against the rule of law in the way in which we interact with people on the high seas, and it has no precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I've seen you quoted as saying there are people in the administration who have wanted to go to war in Venezuela for some time. Who are you talking about?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think it's clear that Senator Rubio, as a senator, was very much an advocate of regime change. This was at odds, really, with President Trump, and so when he was picked, a lot of people who had been supportive of President Trump were- oh, my goodness, they're picking someone much more hawkish and much more eager to be involved and to intervene in other countries. And so people worried. And then the first year or so, people are like, oh, well, Rubio has done a good job on foreign aid, and they've cut back on all of the abuse of these NGOs around the world. And I think the people supporting the President have been very supportive of the Secretary of State. But I think once there's an invasion of Venezuela, or if they decide to re-up the subsidies and the gifts to Ukraine, I think you'll see a splintering and a fracturing of the movement that has supported the President, because I think a lot of people, including myself, were attracted to the president because of his reticence to get us involved in foreign war.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined here in studio by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow, who is one of the six lawmakers who released a recorded video earlier last week urging service members to defy illegal and unlawful orders. Good morning.",
      "JASON CROW: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it was that video that prompted some of this rhetoric from the President. I want to speak though about what's happening right now. I understand there was a bomb threat against your office in Aurora, Colorado, that your family has received painful death threats, even murder threats. Here is some of what your office released.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE STARTS]",
      "UNKNOWN CALLER 1: I hope you all get murdered.",
      "UNKNOWN CALLER 2: You ain't an American, f*****, you're a communist",
      "[SOUNDS ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These, I believe, are phone calls that were made to your office. Are any of these threats credible?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We don't know, Margaret, we're going to take these seriously, but it's very disturbing stuff when you have the President of the United States threatening to execute and to hang and to arrest using this rhetoric, people listen to it. We've seen before a pattern of inciteful, dangerous rhetoric being used by the president and then people acting on that. You know, I lived through and experienced January 6, a very similar dynamic. He's been doing this for years, saying things and total disregard for the outcome, and what might happen when he throws this stuff out in the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President has made these social media posts, but then he then sort of walked some of those threats back, saying he wasn't threatening death. He was saying sedition was often, in the past, punishable by death. And then, before you appeared here today, on social media he put out, \"the traitors that told the military to disobey my orders, should be in jail right now, not roaming the fake news networks. I guess that's us trying to explain what they said was okay. It wasn't and never will be. It was sedition at the highest level. It's a major crime. There can be no other interpretation of what they said.\" That's a quote from what he put on social media. Do you have any idea what all these threats actually mean? Because he mentioned in an interview military courts and referenced the DOJ as well.",
      "REP. CROW: No, we don't know what this means. He doesn't know what this means because he's irresponsible. He's acting dangerous. He's acting in an inciteful way. There's two things going on here Margaret. One is the irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric by the President of the United States threatening to have members of Congress executed who he disagrees with. But it's also so telling that when members of Congress simply remind service members of the Constitution and their duty to obey the law, which is not just our right, but is our obligation to do, that he cannot handle that, and he resorts to threats of violence and threats of arrest and execution. That tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump's respect for the Constitution and the rule of law, and actually underscores our point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's get to the content of what you had in that video you released because there are also 15 House Republicans who are also veterans who released a video, including a retired three-star Marine Corps general, Jack Bergman. Take a listen to this.",
      "[ SOUND ON TAPE STARTS ]",
      "REP. JACK BERGMAN (R-MI) : Troops. Listen up. Any service member who refuses a lawful order is subject to court martial for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
      "REP. AUGUST PFLUGER (R-TX): We study what's lawful and what's not lawful, and the Democrats' stunt insinuating that there are illegal or unconstitutional orders. It's downright dangerous.",
      "REP. SCOTT PERRY (R-PA) : It is corrosive. It is meant to weaken our country and weaken the military.",
      "[ SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to these allegations from your colleagues, fellow veterans, that what you have put out there is weakening and corrosive to the military?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, these, unfortunately, are some of Trump's core supporters that are rallying behind the president, and they know better. They know exactly the difference between lawful versus unlawful. We were very clear in the video that what we're talking about is unlawful\u00a0 orders. You have the president's spokesperson going on into a press conference this past week and saying that we called for people to disobey lawful orders. They're simply lying because the truth is unacceptable to them. It's unacceptable. We wanted to start a conversation, and we did, about the dangerous rhetoric this president is using and the threats that he's made to use our military in an unlawful way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, what?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, send troops into Chicago, send troops into polling stations, kill terrorist families, arrest and execute, arrest and execute members of Congress--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --he hasn't done those things.",
      "REP. CROW: Shoot peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square, need I go on? He has a history of doing this, and if we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them. We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction which is exactly what we did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, so those were comments, not orders he gave, and social media posts and like, but- but I hear you that- that words matter. But the standard for troops, as I understand it, is that they should consult with the staff judge advocate, the staff legal counsel regarding orders, if they have legal questions. There is a process in place. Are you telling the rank and file troops to go outside of that practice?",
      "REP. CROW: No, absolutely not. Let me use an example of how this plays out and what this looks like downrange, as we say in the military--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah, because it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on those people down the chain.",
      "REP. CROW: I did three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. And before each of those combat deployments, I sat my soldiers down, my paratroopers and my Rangers, and we talked about the law of war. We lo- we talked about lawful versus unlawful orders, about the protection of civilians in conflict, right? Because you can't wait until a soldier is in the moment and has to make a split-second decision about what to do to train them, right? You have to talk about it. You have to train them before, which was why we put this video out, to get people thinking about their obligation. And all of the threats and all of the things the President have said would be manifestly unlawful and would be the types of orders that people shouldn't carry through because they would be murder if people actually did the things that Donald Trump threatened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we don't know yet that the deployment of troops on U.S. soil, if you were referring to the National Guard deployments in major U.S. cities, is actually unlawful. That's- that's tied up in the courts right now.",
      "REP. JASON CROW: Well, we're talking about the decision of troops on the ground, out in operations, right? Their interface with civilians, shooting civilians, going to polling stations, which is a violation of U.S. criminal law. Things that are ma--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- these things haven't happened, you are afraid they will.",
      "REP. JASON CROW: --things that are manifestly unlawful, that our troops might be put in the position to carry out, because that has what- that is what the president has repeatedly threatened to do. So again, it's very telling that simply restating their obligation to the Constitution and the law, which we do constantly with our service members gets this type of response from the president. You know, I am not going to be threatened and intimidated by the president of the United States. I have a job to do, and that is to ensure people follow the law. I took an oath to this country. It is a lifetime oath that I intend to carry out, and I am not going to be intimidated and threatened by the president and stop reminding people to follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I've talked to lawyers about this, and military lawyers about this, and there is some frustration that, you know, lawmakers haven't been in Washington doing their job in terms of oversight. There aren't hearings on Venezuela, there aren't hearings on those deployments of the National Guard, and yet there are public videos calling on troops at low ranks to make decisions unto themselves here about what is lawful or unlawful, or recall their training, or talk to their staff judge advocate about this. I mean this- why not first publicly call for a hearing before you call on them?",
      "REP. CROW: First of all, two separate issues. So on the hearing, absolutely right. We are pushing the Trump administration to actually give us briefings, give us hearings. Mike Johnson- Speaker Johnson, shut Congress down twice, twice, to avoid votes on releasing the Epstein files.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He would argue Democrats shut down Congress to- for the healthcare argument.--",
      "REP. CROW: It's very clear what they did. I still came to D.C. anyhow and pushed for oversight and pushed for briefings. So I've been in Congress for seven years almost, and I have never seen the lack of briefings and oversight and ability to access information. I have been completely shut out of the DOD and the CIA at this point as a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee. So this administration--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Isn't so much of this because the Republican leadership in Congress that isn't demanding those things.",
      "REP. CROW: Exactly, right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So-",
      "REP. CROW: Congress has the power to do this, so they're right. We need to be doing this. Democrats are trying to do it. We are being stonewalled and blocked by the Republicans, blocked by the- by the administration, because they actually don't want us to do the oversight, because they're afraid of what we're going to learn. And that is different, Margaret, than what we're talking about, you know, operational decisions, decisions to go to to, you know, war in the Caribbean, Venezuela, which are strictly within the purview of Congress. And Congress needs to be making those decisions and debating it, versus--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House says, oh it's not an act of war. It's, you know, foreign policy. And the president has a lot of leeway under the Constitution. That's their argument.",
      "REP. CROW: Well, we've been hearing this for 25 years, which is why Iraq and Afghanistan went on for as long as it did. We spent $3 trillion, lost 7000 service members' lives, and those ended poorly. Congress has to make that decision. Congress needs to be accountable for it, and Congress needs to be debating this before the American people, going to the American people and telling them why they should send their sons and daughters into conflict and they should spend hundreds of billions of dollars of their hard earned money. This president doesn't want that process to happen. And as somebody that did three combat tours in these wars, I've had enough of Congress being cut out of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you'll see in some of our upcoming polling data that the American public would like more information about the plans for Venezuela, which you were referencing there. Congressman Crow, thank you.",

      "SEN. KELLY: Thank you for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up where we left off on this topic of political violence. I know your family has suffered because of it, very, very directly. And then this past week, the president called that video. You participated in, \"sedition.\" You heard me read what he said again this morning, \"sedition at the highest level and a major crime.\" Have you- do you have credible threats? How concerned are you about your security at this point?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, Margaret, what the President said is very serious. I didn't think he would step over the, over that line calling for the execution of members of Congress, and his words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that. And because of what he says, there is now an increased threats against us. I'm not going to get into details on my personal security, but as the husband of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, we- I understand what political violence is. The president should as well. Just like Gabby, somebody tried to assassinate him, and he should understand that his words, have you know, could have serious, serious consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I remember just weeks ago, hearing from the president and other Republicans about the need to dial back the rhetoric after the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk. When it comes to your\u2013",
      "SEN. KELLY: Yeah, what happened to that? I mean, that was two months ago. Where are they now? We've heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the President has said about hanging members of Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I wanted to ask you. Why aren't we hearing from your Republican colleagues and in terms of your security, I understand there was a request for you to get a boost in Capitol Hill security support. Are Republican members on board with that?",
      "SEN. KELLY: I don't know. I've heard them say, you know very little about this. I think you know the President tries to intimidate them. He tries to intimidate Congress. He looks at government accountability as a nuisance. And I think it's really important for people to understand, Margaret, that the message he sent a couple days ago was, he declared that loyalty to the Constitution is now punishable by death. Those are serious words coming from the President of the United States. He's trying to intimidate us, but Margaret, I'm not going to be intimidated. You know, you just heard Jason Crow. He's not going to be intimidated either. We both served our country. We swore an oath. All we said is we reiterated what basically is the rule of law that members of the military should not, cannot follow illegal orders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point, in terms of lawful and unlawful orders, it gets complicated for rank-and-file to understand. I understand and other networks have reported that the senior judge advocate down at SOUTHCOM raised serious doubts about the legality of the strikes on those alleged drug votes, but was contradicted by lawyers at the executive branch. Have you spoken to the SOUTHCOM commander? Do you- are you hearing that there are unlawful orders being given?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, we're hearing the same thing that you are. The administration hasn't shared much information with us. I read the legal analysis. It was just like the briefs. They're tying themselves in knots trying to explain why what they're doing with regards to these drug boats is legal and it's, it's questionable at best. Our- one of our biggest allies, the United Kingdom, recently stopped sharing intelligence with us in the Caribbean because they question whether this is legal or not. We've been asking for more briefings from the right people. We have not received them, but the information that you just shared with me is the, is the public information. I don't have much more beyond that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the French government has said it's a violation of international law and the law of the sea. That's what our allies are saying about those strikes that are happening there. But, is that why\u2013",
      "SEN. KELLY: But, Margaret getting back to\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013you made this video?",
      "SEN. KELLY: No. The reason why we made this video is a couple things. This president, from before he was in office as he was a candidate, to the time he was in office in his first administration, has said things that cause us great concern. There is a trend here. When he was running for president, the first time he talked about he wanted the military, he said he would, he would- the military should be killing the families of terrorists. And when he was told that that was illegal, this was on a debate stage, he basically said that the military will not refuse to follow my orders, that they will carry out his orders regardless of what they were. Shooting protesters in the legs is something he brought up in his first administration and thankfully, Mark Esper, his Secretary of Defense, and Mark Milley, you know, basically told him, you cannot do that. If they weren't there, think of what possibly could have happened. So, we're concerned\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I need- yeah, I'm sorry. I just want to make sure I get to you on Ukraine, because there's so much happening, and I know you're such a big supporter of Ukraine. There are three prominent U.S. senators who have gone on the record now, including Republican Mike Rounds, who said yesterday, Secretary of State Rubio told them he was unaware of a threat to cut off U.S. support to Ukraine if they don't accept this proposed plan that's on the table. Here is how Senator Rounds described it.",
      "SEN. MIKE ROUNDS SOT: What he told us was that this was not the American proposal. This was a proposal which was received by someone who has identified and they believe to be representing Russia in this proposal. It was given to Mr. Witkoff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So since those remarks were made and backed up by multiple senators, I've received phone calls from Senior White House officials from, from senior U.S. officials saying, no, no, no, that's not at all what, what Secretary Rubio said. What version of events do we believe here in terms of what America is putting forward?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Margaret, they've got to clear this up. You have Rubio talking to my Senate colleague, saying one thing. The spokesperson for the State Department saying another. Your conversations with the White House contradict what the Secretary of State and, by the way, the National Security Adviser, same guy, has said about this. They've got, they've got to figure this out and get the message out and explain to the American people what's going on. I will say this, that, that, that plan, that's Putin's plan. That is a very good deal for Russia. It is a horrible deal for Ukraine, for our allies and even for our own national security. If Putin gets the chance with that deal to, you know, rearm, rebuild his economy and gain territory, by the way, that's what he wanted. Then the Baltics, Poland, Romania, all those other countries down the line are at threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. keeps emphasizing it is a working document, so it may be in a different state than what was leaked by an anti-Zelensky politician, but Ukraine's Ambassador did tell us there's a separate security guarantee document. What, what needs to be in there that would actually protect Ukraine? Does that need to go for a vote before the U.S. Congress?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, it depends on what it is, but Congress should be involved. If there is a treaty with Ukraine on their own security, it's something that we would want to have some say in. And ultimately we would vote on in the United States Senate we would send to the president, but they need to be talking to us about this, on both sides of the aisle. Often the path they're going on recently is to just share information with the Republicans and even my Republican colleagues don't seem to like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "SEN. KELLY: But, that's what this White House is, is doing, and it's because they don't want congressional oversight in, in any way, whether it's on Ukraine, Venezuela, or any, any issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we got to leave it there, senator, but to your point, a number of very fiery statements from Republican senators in the past few hours. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "\"Running for President requires traveling all over the country, begging for donations all day everyday to raise hundreds of millions of dollars, arguing political talking points everyday to the point of exhaustion, destroying your health and having no personal life in order to attempt to get enough votes to become President all to go to work into a system that refuses to fix any of America's problems,\" Greene said Sunday. \"The fact that I'd have to go through all that but would be totally blocked from truly fixing anything is exactly why I would never do it.\"",
      "Greene said she is \"not motivated by power and titles,\" while arguing that the \"Political Industrial Complex has destroyed our country and will never allow someone like me or you to rise to power and actually solve the crises that plague all of us.\"",
      "The Georgia Republican's split with the president, and surprise announcement that she plans to leave Congress, came after she'd grown increasingly vocal in recent months about her opposition to how Republican leaders in Congress are handling health care, affordability and the government shutdown. Meanwhile, she remained stalwart in her support for releasing the Epstein files, even as Republicans faced pressure to capitulate.",
      "For Greene, a reliable ally of Mr. Trump who made a name for herself since coming to Congress in 2021 as a conservative rabble rouser, the break with her party marked a significant and uncharacteristic turn, sparking speculation that she could be setting herself up for a presidential bid.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Friday asked a court to unseal grand jury transcripts in the sex trafficking cases of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "The motion, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida by Attorney General Pam Bondi, follows the congressional passage this week of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a bill that compels the Justice Department to release all unclassified records related to Epstein within 30 days.",
      "\"In the light of the Act's clear mandate, the Court should authorize the Department of Justice to release the grand jury transcripts and lift any preexisting protective orders that would otherwise prevent public disclosure,\" the Justice Department wrote in its motion.",
      "It stated that it would \"make appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information.\"",
      "The motion, which was also signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and U.S. Attorney Jason Quinones, asks the court to \"lift any and all preexisting protective orders that would prevent the Department from complying with the Act.\"",
      "The Justice Department filed an expedited ruling given the Epstein Act's 30-day deadline.",
      "President Trump, who at one time had a friendship with Epstein and had been against the bill, dropped his opposition and signed it into law on Wednesday. Mr. Trump, who cut ties with Epstein years ago, has not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "In July 2019, a New York federal grand jury indicted Epstein on child sex trafficking charges, about five weeks before he was found dead in a Manhattan jail. His death was later ruled a suicide.",
      "Then, in June 2020, a New York federal grand jury indicted Maxwell, Epstein's former partner, of conspiring with Epstein and helping to facilitate and operate his sex trafficking ring. She was convicted in December 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "This marks the latest attempt by the Justice Department to unseal Epstein and Maxwell's grand jury records.",
      "In August, a New York judge denied a similar Justice Department request to unseal grand jury material in the Maxwell case, arguing that anyone \"who reviewed these materials expecting, based on the Government's representations, to learn new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes and the investigation into them, would come away feeling disappointed and misled. There is no 'there' there.\"",
      "Epstein, a wealthy financier known for his connections to political elites and high-profile people, was under federal probes for decades over allegations of sex trafficking. In 2008, he pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges of soliciting prostitution in exchange for having a federal case against him dropped. He served 13 months in county jail and had to register as a sex offender.",
      "The Epstein case received renewed attention starting in July when the Justice Department released a two-page memo stating that a \"systematic review\" had \"revealed\" that Epstein had \"incriminating 'client list,' and that \"no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.\"",
      "The memo, which prompted an outcry from Epstein accusers, came after Bondi had said in a February interview that there was an Epstein client list \"sitting on my desk right now.\"",
      "Several batches of Epstein-linked documents have been intermittently released throughout the years. The latest such release occurred earlier this month, when a tranche of tens of thousands of pages of documents were released by both House Democrats and the House Oversight Committee.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-website-change-vaccines-autism/",
    "published": "Sat, 22 Nov 2025 09:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees without input from relevant agency staffers.",
    "story": [
      "A page of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was changed Thursday to include a false claim about autism and vaccines. Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees inside the Department of Health and Human Services without input from relevant agency staffers.",
      "The page about vaccines and autism formerly said that \"no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and Autism spectrum disorder.\" The website has now been changed to say, \"'Vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim\" \u2014 a statement the Autism Science Foundation calls \"misinformation\" that \"actually contradicts the best available science.\" The CDC page also falsely claims that studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have \"been ignored by health authorities.\"",
      "Previously, changes have only occurred in consultation with subject matter experts at the agency's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The CDC sources told CBS News political appointees at HHS devised the change and instructed an employee inside the office of acting CDC Director Jim O'Neil to make it.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, later said in an\u00a0interview with The New York Times\u00a0that he personally ordered the change.",
      "Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. It presents with a wide range of symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. The National Institutes of Health has committed hundreds of millions of dollars a year to studying the condition and trying to understand how and why it develops.",
      "The debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism has its roots in a 1998 study that was\u00a0found to be fraudulent\u00a0and has been retracted. Since then, \"independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people,\" said American Academy of Pediatrics president Susan Kressly in a statement decrying the website change.",
      "\"We are at a very dangerous moment for the health of America's children,\" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a news briefing on Thursday.",
      "Research has found no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared to those who are not. Vaccines also undergo intensive safety testing. Research shows that genetics play a role in autism diagnoses. The NIH says some possible risk factors for autism include prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or low birth weight, certain maternal health conditions, or parents conceiving at an older age.",
      "\"There is overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism,\" said Dr. Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director. \"This change to CDC language undermines the agency's scientific integrity, damaging its credibility on vaccines and other health recommendations. Most concerning, it risks endangering children by driving down vaccination rates and leaving kids vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.\"",
      "In a statement, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said, \"This is a common-sense update that brings CDC's website in line with our commitment to transparency and gold standard science.",
      "\"As the updated page explains, the claim that 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not supported by comprehensive evidence, as studies to date have not definitively ruled out potential associations. Some research suggesting possible biologic mechanisms has been ignored or dismissed by public health agencies, and HHS is committed to finding a definitive answer,\" Nixon said.",
      "Leading autism advocacy groups dispute that.",
      "The Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0it was \"appalled\" by the change to the CDC's website, and highlighted the decades of research into the topic. Alison Singer, the co-founder and president of the ASF, said that while researchers \"can't do a scientific study to show that something does not cause something else,\" there are a \"mountain of studies that we have exonerating vaccines as a cause of autism.\"",
      "\"I think the question of whether vaccines causes autism is one that science can answer, and science has answered it,\" Singer said in Thursday's news briefing.",
      "A subhead saying that \"Vaccines do not cause autism\" remains on the CDC website with an asterisk next to it. The bottom of the page explains that the header remains in place because of an agreement with Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who is the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and backed Kennedy during his confirmation hearings. Cassidy said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he supported Kennedy in part because of \"serious commitments\" from the Trump administration, but did not specify what those were.",
      "\"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Cassidy wrote on social media on Thursday afternoon. \"What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.\"",
      "Cassidy highlighted recent outbreaks of whooping cough and measles. He also called for more research into \"the real causes of autism,\" and criticized\u00a0HHS funding\u00a0cuts.",
      "\"Redirecting attention to factors we definitely know DO NOT cause autism denies families the answers they deserve,\" Cassidy wrote.",
      "Other health agency pages with information about autism and vaccines had not been changed as of early Thursday afternoon.",
      "Kennedy has previously pushed the\u00a0discredited claim\u00a0that routine\u00a0childhood shots\u00a0cause autism. President Trump has also falsely suggested vaccines could be to blame for autism rates. Both expressed concern about rising rates of\u00a0autism diagnoses, which appear to be driven by a variety of factors including\u00a0increased awareness\u00a0and changes in how the condition is diagnosed.",
      "O'Leary said he feared the website changes would \"scare parents and further stigmatize\" people with autism.",
      "\"We have been dealing with these falsehoods for many years. They are not new. We have been promoting the science, and we're going to continue to do that, as are the other professional societies,\" he said. \"The problem is now it's coming from, these falsehoods are coming for our federal government.\"",
      "Experts have previously raised concerns about Kennedy reviving debunked theories about the cause of autism. In April, Kennedy announced the CDC would conduct a \"massive testing and research effort\" to find out what causes the disorder, and hired David Geier, a man who repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the effort. Kennedy said the work would be completed by September, though other health officials later pushed the timeline.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers, an infectious disease physician and former CDC official, said that the website change showed scientists \"who in the past carefully vetted scientific information have been pushed aside.\"",
      "The \"CDC should be a data-driven agency based on science and not ideology, but when you take the scientists out of the process you get rhetoric that can harm families,\" said former CDC chief science and medical officer Dr. Debra Houry, who lresigned from the agency earlier this year.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Nicole  Brown Chau and \n                                                  \n                      Paula  Cohen",

    "summary": "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

      "Summer Heather Worden, 50, told law enforcement in July 2019 that her former spouse had illegally accessed her bank account earlier that year while she was in space, according to a news release from the Department of Justice. Her wife, previously identified as astronaut\u00a0Anne McClain, was at the ISS from December 2018 to June 2019. It was the first allegation of a crime being committed in space.",
      "An investigation by NASA's Office of the Inspector General found that Worden had opened the bank account in April 2018 and that both she and McClain had access to it until January 2019, the Justice Department said. The investigation also found that Worden had regularly given McClain access to her bank records, including login credentials, from at least 2015, the news release said.",
      "McClain said in 2019 that she had accessed the bank account with Worden's permission, The New York Times reported. Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer, disputed that claim and filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. A complaint filed to NASA's Office of Inspector General by Worden's family accused McClain of identity theft and improper access.",
      "McClain denied the allegations\u00a0on social media\u00a0and said that she and Worden had \"been going through a painful, personal separation that's now unfortunately in the media.\"",
      "Worden pleaded guilty to one count of lying to law enforcement on Nov. 13. She will be sentenced in February 2026. Worden faces up to 5 years in federal prison, as well as a maximum possible fine of $250,000, and remains on bond pending the hearing.",

She participated in a spacewalk during the mission, years after she was set to take part in NASA's first all-female spacewalk, which was delayed at the last minute because there were not enough suits available after she requested a size adjustment.

      "Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to offer $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. However, the e-commerce company neither admitted nor denied the FTC's allegations. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time, the company said that \"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Amazon refund, including how to determine if you qualify for the payment.",

      "Nvidia's third-quarter financial results on Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations, signaling that demand for its artificial intelligence chips remains robust amid investor concerns about an AI bubble.",
      "The chipmaker reported earnings of $31.9 billion on record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter. Revenue for the period surged 22% from the previous quarter and 62% from a year ago. Its earnings per share were $1.30. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had been expected to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $54.9 billion for the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday, referring to the company's proprietary superchips that power large language models.",
      "\"Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference \u2014 each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",
      "\"This is a huge print and guidance from Nvidia that should reignite the bullish tech trade into year-end,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, adding that he thinks \"fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated.",
      "In October, the chipmaker became the first publicly listed company worth $5 trillion, with its shares buoyed by Wall Street expectations of surging demand.",
      "Rational exuberance?",
      "In recent weeks, some investors have expressed caution about the hype surrounding AI and whether the soaring market value of companies linked to the technology is warranted. Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "The rapid construction of data centers across the U.S. has boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Data center investment, which includes spending on AI research and development, has become the largest contributor to U.S. growth this year, according to S&P Global.",
      "The S&P 500's 15% gain this year has been driven largely by big tech companies with AI investments. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 accounts for 37% of the index's total value,\u00a0according\u00a0to Morningstar.",
      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",
      "China hurdle",
      "Nvidia reported robust demand for its chips despite being blocked from the vital Chinese market because of U.S. export restrictions as the two nations compete on AI.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Collete Kress on Wednesday said the company is \"disappointed\" it can't ship products to China.",
      "\"To establish a sustainable leadership and position in AI computing, America must win the support of every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China,\" she said, adding that Nvidia will continue to push for access to the Chinese market.",

    "summary": "The rulings\u200b from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie are a significant victory for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday ordered the criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey\u00a0and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured their indictments, was unlawfully appointed to the role.",
      "The rulings from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie are a significant victory for Comey and James, who both argued their prosecutions are retaliatory and motivated by President Trump's efforts to punish his political foes.",
      "\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie wrote in her opinion in the Comey case, a line that she repeated in her ruling in the James case.",
      "Currie ordered the indictments to be dismissed without prejudice, which would allow prosecutors to seek charges again. She suggested that prosecutors could not seek a new indictment in Comey's case since the statute of limitations for the offenses expired at the end of September.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking at an unrelated news conference in Memphis on Monday, told reporters the Justice Department will \"be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal.\"",
      "Lawyers for both Comey and James are also seeking to have their indictments tossed out on numerous other legal grounds, including that the prosecutions are vindictive and selective. The judge overseeing Comey's case heard arguments on his motion last week but has yet to rule.",
      "\"I am heartened by today's victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,\" James said in a statement in response to the ruling. \"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.\"",
      "In a video statement, Comey said \"the message has to be sent that the president of the United States cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies.\"",
      "\"I'm grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence, and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking,\" he said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an appearance on Fox News, \"We believe the attorney in this case, Lindsey Halligan, is not only extremely qualified for this position, but she was in fact legally appointed.\"",
      "The judge's rulings",
      "In her decisions, the judge found that Halligan's appointment violated both a federal law known as Section 546, which governs U.S. attorney vacancies, and the Constitution's Appointments Clause.",
      "In evaluating the text of Section 546, Currie found that the power to name an interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia for 120 days to fill the current vacancy rested not with the attorney general, but with district court for the region. She wrote that if the government's interpretation of the law were correct, then the president could evade the Senate confirmation process \"indefinitely\" by \"stacking\" consecutive 120-day appointments.",
      "\"In sum, the text, structure, and history of section 546 point to one conclusion: the Attorney General's authority to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney lasts for a total of 120 days from the date she first invokes section 546 after the departure of a Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorney,\" Currie wrote. \"If the position remains vacant at the end of the 120-day period, the exclusive authority to make further interim appointments under the statute shifts to the district court, where it remains until the President's nominee is confirmed by the Senate. Ms. Halligan was not appointed in a manner consistent with this framework.\"",
      "She concluded that Halligan has been unlawfully serving as interim U.S. attorney since Sept. 22. Comey was indicted Sept. 25, and James was charged Oct. 9.",
      "Halligan's appointment",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in one of the criminal cases brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith. She took over as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia in a temporary capacity in late September and sought the indictments against Comey and James soon after.",
      "Bondi tapped Halligan as interim U.S. attorney shortly after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Bondi appointed Halligan under Section 546, the federal law that governs U.S. attorney vacancies and allows the attorney general to select an interim U.S. attorney, who can then serve for 120 days. The Trump administration has invoked that law and another measure to install temporary prosecutors in New Jersey, Nevada and Los Angeles, though three different federal judges have all found they were serving unlawfully.",
      "In the U.S. Attorney's Office in eastern Virginia, Siebert had first been tapped to lead the office in January to serve for 120 days. Ahead of the expiration of his term, the federal court for the region voted to keep him in the role, exercising authority granted to it under federal law.",
      "After Siebert departed, though, Mr. Trump urged Bondi to install Halligan in the post. Bondi issued a September order purporting to name Halligan as the interim U.S. attorney, to serve for 120 days. Days after she took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Halligan secured the two-count indictment against Comey, which accuses him of lying to Congress during testimony in September 2020 and obstructing a congressional proceeding. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted in early October on charges of bank fraud. Both have pleaded not guilty to their respective charges.",
      "Comey's attorneys argued that his indictment was \"fatally flawed\" because Halligan, who alone presented the case to the grand jury and signed the indictment, was invalidly appointed to her position.",
      "They argued that under the framework for a temporary U.S. attorney appointment, the 120-day clock starts from the time of the attorney general's initial appointment of Siebert and limits the total tenure of interim appointments to 120 days. Because Siebert had already served the 120 days, only the district court had authority to appoint a successor, defense lawyers said.",
      "But Justice Department lawyers defended the validity of Halligan's selection and argued the 120-day limit applies on a \"per-appointment basis.\" Each appointment, they said, triggers its own clock and requires the attorney general to revisit her interim selections every 120 days.",
      "To shore up Halligan's work in Comey and James' cases, the Justice Department submitted to the court an October order from Bondi that also purported to name her special attorney, applied retroactively, and ratified her actions before the grand juries and signature on the indictments.",
      "Justice Department lawyers argued that even if Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid, any government lawyer can present a case to a grand jury or sign an indictment, and Bondi has the authority to make her a government attorney.",
      "But Currie rejected Bondi's attempt to retroactively name Halligan as a special attorney and wrote that the Justice Department has not pointed to any authority that allows the attorney general to \"reach back in time and rewrite the terms of a past appointment.\" She also said the attorney general's attempt to ratify Halligan's actions falls short.",
      "\"The implications of a contrary conclusion are extraordinary,\" Currie wrote. \"It would mean the Government could send any private citizen off the street \u2014 attorney or not \u2014 into the grand jury room to secure an indictment so long as the Attorney General gives her approval after the fact. That cannot be the law.\"",
      "Currie heard arguments on Comey's bid to dismiss the case on the appointment grounds earlier this month alongside the similar effort by James. Like in Comey's case, only Halligan presented the case against James to the grand jury and signed the indictment.",
      "Asked on Monday if the ruling would have any impact on Halligan's role, Bondi told reporters, \"it does not.\"",
      "\"We have made Lindsay Halligan a special U.S. attorney so she is in court,\" Bondi said. \"She can fight in court just like she was, and we believe we will be successful on appeal.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa. Mr. Trump has labeled antifa as a domestic terror organization, though there isn't a formal system for designating U.S.-based terror groups, and antifa usually refers to a loose collection of left-wing activists rather than a single organization with centralized leadership.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nursing-professional-degree-excluded-list/",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:10:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Nursing advocates say a proposed rule could worsen a shortage of professionals in the field and lead to worse health outcomes.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal from the Trump administration would exclude nursing from a list of professional degrees, a move that has drawn outcry from nursing advocates, who warn it could worsen the nation's nurse shortage by limiting how much students can borrow for their training.",
      "The change stems from changes authorized by the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act, which introduced a new cap on borrowing for higher education. Starting July 1, 2026, students enrolled in professional degree programs will be restricted to borrowing $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.",
      "Students in graduate programs that aren't deemed professional will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Nursing professionals say they're alarmed by the proposed rule's definition of what constitutes a professional degree, which lists some medical fields, including pharmacy, dentistry and medical doctors, but doesn't include nursing. Capping loans for nursing students could ultimately restrict students' access to enrolling in degree programs at a time when the industry is already grappling with a shortage of nurses, they say.",
      "The proposal would create \"obstacles for students who want to pursue advanced degrees, which would most likely lead to decreased students pursuing degrees in nursing,\" Kim Litwack, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Nursing, told CBS News. \"That means there will be less of these professionals joining the workforce.\"",
      "In a statement issued earlier this month, the Education Department said the proposal creates a new definition of a professional student to determine who qualifies for the higher loan limits.",
      "The goal of the changes, including the new loan caps, is to ensure that borrowers won't face \"insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off,\" said Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent in the statement.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the Education Department said 95% of nursing students won't be impacted by the borrowing cap.",
      "\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" said Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education at the agency. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",
      "What's a professional degree?",
      "Under the Education Department's proposal, a professional degree is one that \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession, and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"",
      "The programs that it defines as professional include: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology. Students in degree programs that aren't considered professional \u2014 such as those in nursing, physical therapy and physician assistant degrees \u2014 would have lower loan caps under the proposed rule.",
      "Other groups representing professions that were excluded under the proposal also issued objections, such as the Council on Social Work Education, which said it was \"disheartened and concerned.\" The American Academy of Audiology pointed out that audiology isn't included, which it said could discourage students from pursuing careers in the field.",
      "Nursing's exclusion from the list of professional degree programs \"makes no sense,\" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association.",
      "In addition to lowering the loan cap, the \"big, beautiful bill\" law also eliminates the Grad PLUS program that allows graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of obtaining a degree.",
      "Kennedy and other nursing industry advocates who disagree with the omission of nursing as a professional degree are hopeful the proposal could be changed before it's adopted.",
      "\"It feels like a miscommunication, and we hope the Department of Education changes the proposed language before the rule comes out for public comment. They did add professions to the list before it was released, so they could have added nurses, which clearly belong,\" she said.",
      "The Education Department said the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, although it didn't specify a date, and will be open for public comment.",
      "\"A real gut punch\"",
      "Olga Yakusheva, an economist and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, said limiting how much money nursing students can borrow could curb entry into the field.",
      "\"It's going to limit the ability of nurses to apply for graduate school, and on the back end, it will limit the number of nurses available in primary care settings and in hospitals,\" she said. \"Communities with shortages of physicians will feel this the most.\"",
      "Patricia Pittman, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said nurses fill critical medical care gaps in rural communities. The rule could create financial barriers that she says would disincentivize nurses from seeking advanced licensing, which ultimately could harm rural areas.",
      "\"Basically, nobody would be there if it weren't for these nurse practitioners,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Pittman also says it will have a negative effect on morale within the nursing profession.",
      "\"It's a real gut punch, and the result nurses are going to be angry about this,\" she said.",

      "Garza said he informed his manager, J.D. Aupperle, about the comments on Jan. 10 and claims Aupperle did not encourage him to report the incident to human resources.",

      "A higher Medicare premium set to go into effect in 2026 will push the monthly charge above $200 for the first time, with the increase likely to erode next year's cost-of-living increase for millions of Social Security recipients.",
      "The premium for Medicare's Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, will rise 9.7% to $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from the current $185 monthly cost, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0said earlier this month. It's the largest increase since 2022, when the Part B premium jumped 15%.",
      "The Part B deductible \u2014 the amount seniors must pay out of pocket before their coverage kicks in\u2014 is also rising about 10%, jumping to $283 next year from this year's $257.",
      "Medicare Part B premiums, deductibles and coinsurance rates are determined under a formula in the Social Security Act.",
      "The Part B premium, which is deducted automatically from seniors' monthly Social Security checks, is rising at a rate that's three times that of inflation, partly due to a rise in underlying health care costs, Anne Montgomery, senior health policy expert at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), said in a\u00a0blog\u00a0post. The Medicare premium increase means that seniors may not have much room to keep up with inflation, Max Richtman, the president and CEO of the same group, told CBS News.",
      "\"So many rely on [Social Security] for all or most of their income,\" he said. \"This is gonna hurt.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration set next year's cost-of-living increase at 2.8%, which will boost the average Social Security paycheck by $56 to about $2,071 per month.",
      "The Medicare Part B premium hike will consume about a third of next year's COLA, effectively lowering the rate to 1.9% \u2014 far below the current inflation rate of 3%, according to NCPSSM's analysis. People with lower monthly benefits could even see an effective COLA of zero, the group said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) told CBS News that the Medicare premium increase would have been significantly higher if the administration had not taken cost-saving measures, such as \"reigning in the fraudulent use of skin substitutes.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration is preserving Medicare by keeping the program affordable and sustainable for future generations,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Rising health care costs",
      "According to the CMS spokesperson, the main factor behind the Medicare premium and deductible increases is the projected growth in overall health care spending.",
      "Health care costs have been rising for all Americans, contributing to the sticker shock that seniors and other groups are experiencing. In 2023, Americans spent an average of $1,514 on out-of-pocket health care costs, an increase of 9% from 2020 on an inflation-adjusted basis, according to KFF.",
      "Working adults will also face higher health care premiums in 2026. Roughly 22 million Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces will also be faced with steep rate hikes if Congress fails to extend premium tax credits, which help lower the cost for the majority of people on ACA plans.",
      "Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, which became the main sticking point in the recent government shutdown. Without an extension, Americans who rely on the tax credit could see their costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Workers with employee-sponsored coverage are also likely to see their costs climb\u00a0next year, with most expected to pay 6% to 7% more for their 2026 plans, according to an analysis from consultant Mercer.",

      "Viola Ford Fletcher, the oldest survivor of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, has died at the age of 111, Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols announced Monday.",
      "\"Today, our city mourns the loss of Mother Viola Fletcher - a survivor of one of the darkest chapters in our city's history. Mother Fletcher endured more than anyone should, yet she spent her life lighting a path forward with purpose,\" Nichols said on social media.",
      "\"Mother Fletcher carried 111 years of truth, resilience, and grace and was a reminder of how far we've come and how far we must still go,\" he said. \"She never stopped advocating for justice for the survivors and descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, and I hope we all can carry forward her legacy with the courage and conviction she modeled every day of her life.\"",
      "Fletcher, a grandmother of six who had been living in North Texas, told CBS News in a 2021 interview that she thought about the massacre every day.",
      "\"It will be something I'll never forget,\" she said.",
      "Tulsa's Greenwood District, which was known as \"Black Wall Street,\" was destroyed by a White mob after a Black man was accused of assaulting a White woman. At least 300 Black residents were killed, and thousands were left homeless following the daylong massacre in which White rioters attacked Black residents, looted businesses and burned buildings.",
      "The National Guard was brought in, imposing martial law and helping to round up and imprison Black people. More than 35 blocks were charred and 6,000 people were held in detention \u2014 some for up to eight days, according to the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum.",
      "\"We had friends and played outside and [would] visit with neighbors and was happy there with our parents. Just loved being there,\" Fletcher told CBS News, recalling Greenwood before the massacre.",
      "Lessie Benningfield Randle, who turned 111 earlier this month, is now the only survivor of the Tulsa Massacre.",
      "Randle, Fletcher and her brother Hughes Van Ellis, who died in 2023, were among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against the city and county of Tulsa in 2020 seeking reparations for the massacre.",
      "They testified before Congress about the violent mob's actions 100 years after the riot.",
      "\"I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burned. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams,\" Fletcher told the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties in 2021.",
      "The city of Tulsa has argued it should not be forced to pay anything because today's residents had nothing to do with what happened more than a century ago.",
      "With none of the perpetrators having ever been prosecuted for their crimes, descendants of survivors and human rights activists have long called for reparations for the continued damage done to their Oklahoma community.",
      "But some form of payment could soon be sent out.",
      "Nichols, who became the city's first Black mayor last year, unveiled in June a $105 million package to commemorate the first Tulsa Race Massacre Observance Day. The \"Road to Repair\" plan aims to address socioeconomic and health disparities stemming from the massacre, Nichols told The New York Times.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday signed an executive order meant to accelerate scientific discovery through the use of artificial intelligence, directing the Energy Department and its national labs to build an integrated AI platform using their existing and future supercomputers.",
      "The goal of what the White House is calling the \"Genesis Mission\" is to speed the research and scientific discovery process by analyzing massive data sets in the science, engineering, energy and health care spaces from the federal government, university and private sector with supercomputing technology. It's an AI initiative the White House hopes will result in quicker breakthroughs in areas of research including disease therapies.",
      "Michael Krastios, science adviser to the president, told reporters on a conference call the Genesis mission is \"the largest marshaling of federal scientific resources since the Apollo program.\"",
      "\"By fusing massive federal data sets, advanced supercomputing capabilities, and world-leading scientific facilities, the Genesis mission will use AI to automate experiment design, accelerate simulation and generate protective models for everything from protein folding to fusion plasma dynamics,\" Krastios said. \"This will shorten discovery timelines from years to days or even hours, empowering scientists to test bolder hypotheses and discover breakthroughs currently unreachable.\"",
      "White House officials told reporters on the conference call that they want to bring in AI supercomputing capacity that the private sector is building. The White House said there's been significant interest from the private sector from companies that include Nvidia and Dell.",
      "The effort will begin with the existing supercomputers at the Department of Energy's 17 national labs, although the administration intends to build more supercomputers.",
      "It's not clear, however, how the mission will be funded, and White House officials suggested that more help from Congress could be needed down the road. One of the officials on the call said the Energy Department already operates \"some of the best supercomputing facilities in the world.\" The official said that the administration will leverage all available resources and, with the help of Congress would \"continue to invest increasing amounts for the success of the mission.\"",
      "\"I think we will see unbelievable advancements in health sciences, so many diseases today that are unfortunate death sentences,\" one of the officials on the call said. \"We're going to understand the exact chemistry and biology that they are and how to combat that. We've seen progress with that relatively significant progress the last five years. It's nothing compared to what we're going to see in the next five years.\"",

      "The commission is warning customers to immediately stop using lithium-ion batteries that power e-bikes made by Seattle, Washington-based Rad Power Bikes. The batteries can ignite and explode, causing serious injury or death, the agency warned.",
      "Rad Power Bikes said it disagreed with the agency's warning.",
      "\"Rad Power Bikes firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC's characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe,\" a Rad spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The batteries that pose a fire hazard are model numbers are RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304, according to the CPSC. They are particularly vulnerable to catching fire when they are exposed to water and also to what the commission describes as \"debris.\"",
      "CPSC said it has received 31 reports of the batteries causing fires, including 12 reports of fires that caused property damage. Cumulatively, accidents related to the batteries have caused roughly $734,500 in property damage, it said, adding that some of the incidents took place when a battery was neither charging nor in use.",
      "CPSC is urging consumers to immediately stop using the batteries, which it said should be removed from the e-bikes and disposed of in accordance with local disposal procedures. It added that Rad Power Bikes has not agreed to recall the products.",

    "summary": "NBA Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups appeared in court over allegations of cheating in high-stakes poker games that prosecutors say were operated by mafia figures.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 NBA Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups pleaded not guilty Monday in federal court in Brooklyn, nearly a month after he was among dozens of people arrested in a sweeping FBI crackdown on alleged illegal gambling rings. Billups is facing charges of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering.",
      "The 49-year-old \u2014 who had served as head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers until being suspended by the league in late October following his arrest \u2014 was released on $5 million bond secured by his home in Colorado. Billups' wife, Piper, and daughter, Cydney, appeared in court to sign the bond document. He also agreed to surrender his passport, abide by travel restrictions and report any financial transactions over $25,000.",
      "Billups appeared alongside 30 other defendants in the Eastern District's massive ceremonial courtroom to face charges over allegations of cheating in high-stakes poker games operated by mafia figures.",
      "The elaborate cheating scheme netted more than $7 million from rigged games, prosecutors said. They said Monday there were at least 25 separate rigged games.",
      "The hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Ramon Reyes also allowed defendants and their attorneys to update the court on scheduling, progress and deadlines for discovery, motion filings and settlement talks in the now-designated complex case.",
      "Prosecutors said plea discussions have begun with some defendants but no formal plea deals have been offered. Prosecutors said the government would be ready to release discovery, which is expected to be more than a terabyte, within two weeks after a protective order is in place and a coordinating discovery attorney is assigned.",
      "There are two federal cases in the crackdown. One focuses on high-stakes poker games while the other concerns a sports betting ring. The second indictment revolves around bets on NBA basketball games, which were allegedly placed using insider information related to injury reports.",
      "The two indictments have a combined 34 defendants, 31 of whom are charged in the poker case.",
      "Former NBA player Damon Jones has been indicted in both cases. He pleaded not guilty earlier this month in both indictments and was released on a $200,000 bond, secured by his parents' Texas home. Jones appeared in court on Monday.",
      "The indictment in the sports betting case has also ensnared Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, who is accused of providing nonpublic information in exchange for a flat fee or a cut of the profits. In one game in particular, prosecutors allege, Rozier told a co-conspirator that he would fake an injury in order to leave a game early. Defendants charged solely under this indictment did not appear Monday in court.",
      "Several alleged members of the mob appeared in court as prosecutors said many of the rigged ongoing poker games were backed by Mafia families. Most of the 31 accused defendants in the poker case had been released on bond over the past several weeks; however, defendants who prosecutors allege had strong ties to organized crime were not as fortunate.",
      "Angelo Ruggiero, Jr., who prosecutors allege was a member of the Genovese crime family and an organizer of the Washington Place poker game, was denied bail after his attorney offered a bail application of $5 million. Thomas Gelardo, also known as \"Juice,\" who prosecutors allege is an associate of the Bonanno family, supervised the Lexington Avenue poker game and took a cut of the proceeds, prosecutors claim.",
      "Because there are so many defendants, prosecutors filed a motion last week asking the court to divide the 31 defendants in the poker case into three groups, with each group having 10 to 11 defendants for status conferences for \"convenience.\" Some defense attorneys opposed the motion, saying the government is trying to \"divide and conquer\" the defendants. The judge reserved a decision during the hearing on whether or not the defendants would be broken up into groups, saying, \"We will keep everyone together for the moment.\"",
      "Judge Reyes scheduled the next status conference for March 4 at 2:00 p.m.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 12:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Fewer than one-third of those arrested by Border Patrol during the recent immigration crackdown in Charlotte were classified as criminals, a government document says.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer than one-third of the individuals arrested by Border Patrol during the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement crackdown in Charlotte were classified as criminals, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security document obtained by CBS News.",
      "The government document undermines claims by Trump administration officials who said the crackdown, dubbed Operation Charlotte's Web, was primarily focused on apprehending immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also had criminal histories and posed a threat to public safety.",
      "Roughly 200 green-uniformed Border Patrol agents recorded more than 270 immigration arrests during the Charlotte campaign, which began on the weekend of Nov. 15, the document shows. Fewer than 90 of those arrested by Border Patrol were categorized as \"criminal aliens\" in the document.",
      "Those statistics do not include arrests made by officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, though Border Patrol played the principal role in Operation Charlotte's Web. The document also does not specify the severity of the crimes of the detainees listed as criminals, nor whether their records included convictions or solely criminal charges.",
      "While DHS has publicly maintained that the crackdown in Charlotte is ongoing, separate internal documents say Border Patrol's operation there concluded, with agents demobilizing from the area last week. ICE has a permanent presence in North Carolina, and is expected to continue operations there.",
      "CBS News has reported, citing U.S. officials and internal DHS documents, that Border Patrol is preparing to launch a new operation in New Orleans as soon as the first week of December.",
      "A spokesperson for DHS said the information reported by CBS News is \"likely inaccurate,\" but did not offer a breakdown of criminality that was different to the numbers contained in the document.",
      "The spokesperson cited a press release that announced over 130 immigration arrests in the Charlotte area during the first two days of the operation, including 44 individuals who DHS said had criminal charges or convictions for aggravated assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault on a police officer, battery, driving under the influence and other crimes. Two of the detainees were identified as gang members in the release.",
      "The DHS document obtained by CBS News offers a window into the most recent operation led by outspoken and controversial Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the de facto on-the-ground enforcer of President Trump's clampdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the past months, the Trump administration has tasked Bovino and teams of Border Patrol agents with bringing its mass deportation campaign to several cities led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Chicago and, most recently, Charlotte. The deployment has been unprecedented in nature and scope. Border Patrol's work has been historically limited to stopping the illegal movement of people and drugs along the borders with Mexico and Canada, as well as some coastal regions.",
      "In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents \u2014 in some cases accompanied by Bovino \u2014 have carried out arrests, often captured on social media videos, at Home Depot parking lots and other public areas, rounding up day laborers, landscapers and other immigrants they suspect are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The aggressive operations have fueled strong criticism from local elected officials, who have denounced Border Patrol's actions as harsh and indiscriminate, and accused agents of engaging in racial profiling, including against Hispanic U.S. citizens. Trump administration officials have rejected those accusations, saying use of force has been employed to protect agents and that arrests have been based on someone's illegal presence in the U.S., not their race.",
      "In the Charlotte area, Border Patrol agents were captured on video smashing the car window of a U.S. citizen, carrying out arrests outside of businesses and approaching men decorating a Christmas tree.",
      "Like in Chicago and Los Angeles, the operation in Charlotte triggered significant community backlash and concerns. Some businesses closed their doors temporarily. Local high school students staged walk-outs to protest the arrests. And school officials in the region reported tens of thousands of student absences.",
      "A CBS News poll released this past weekend found that 58% of Americans believed federal immigration agents were stopping and detaining \"more people than necessary.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",
      "Federal government figures indicate there are currently 3,969 people enrolled in the Myanmar TPS program. Unless a court intervenes, the program will expire in late January.",

    "summary": "Judge Matthew Thornhill wrote in a letter that he intended \"to add levity at times when I thought it would help relax litigants.\"",
    "story": [
      "A Missouri judge who wore an Elvis Presley wig in his courtroom and played the singer's music from his phone during court proceedings has agreed to a deal that would cut his career on the bench short.",
      "Judge Matthew Thornhill in suburban St. Louis faces a six-month unpaid suspension under the deal he reached with a state board to avoid a disciplinary hearing. After the suspension, he would serve 18 more months on the bench before resigning from the St. Charles County Circuit Court.",
      "The agreement, reached last month, is pending before the Missouri Supreme Court, spokeswoman Beth Riggert said Friday. The court agreed Thursday to accept 35 letters in support of Thornhill's character.",
      "Thornhill wrote in a letter dated Nov. 12 that he intended \"to add levity at times when I thought it would help relax litigants.\" But he added: \"I now recognize that this could affect the integrity and solemnity of the proceedings.\"",
      "\"I can assure you that I will do my very best in the future to serve the people of the State of Missouri with honor and dignity,\" Thornhill wrote.",
      "Online court records don't indicate who filed the complaint that triggered the discipline. His attorney, Neil Bruntrager, didn't immediately return a phone message from The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "While the Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline also faulted Thornhill for talking about politics from the bench, it highlighted his affinity for the \"King of Rock 'n' Roll\" first. The court file is sprinkled with photos of Thornhill on the bench or posing with staff in a plastic Elvis wig and sunglasses.",
      "According to the commission, Thornhill routinely wore the wig in the courtroom around Halloween and would offer people options on how they wanted to be sworn in before testifying, including an option where he played Elvis' music from his phone. Thornhill also sometimes played the songs while entering the courtroom, court records show.",
      "The board also said Thornhill sometimes mentioned Elvis lyrics or the singer's date of birth or death during court, even though it wasn't relevant.",
      "All the Elvis references violated rules requiring a judge to maintain \"order and decorum\" and \"promote confidence in the integrity of the judiciary,\" the commission found, without saying how long the behavior had been going on.",
      "Thornhill is the longest-serving judge in St. Charles County and a former assistant prosecutor there, according to a biography posted on the court website. He was elected an associate circuit judge in 2006 and a circuit judge in 2024. His primary assignment is family court. His public Facebook page has more than 300 followers.",
      "In 2008, he was reprimanded and fined $750. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the fine stemmed from Thornhill reducing the charges against a woman he was prosecuting after she offered to give him a baseball signed by Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Thornhill denied taking the baseball, which was a fake.",
      "In the latest case, Thornhill was also cited for mentioning his political affiliation and preferred election candidates during court business. At times, he commented on where his \"Thornhill for Judge\" campaign signs were posted or remarked that litigants or attorneys lived in \"Thornhill for Judge Country,\" court documents said.",
      "Once, he asked someone appearing in court if the labor union the person worked for had \"warmed up to Thornhill for judge,\" court records show.",
      "Thornhill wrote that, although the references to campaign signs were made in informal conversations, they were still a mistake.",
      "\"Never did they impact a decision,\" he wrote.",
      "He was also criticized for offering a character letter in an adoption case, which the commission deemed an abuse of his position. Thornhill agreed it was \"a mistake and improper.\"",
      "A court transcript of the case shows three images of Thornhill wearing the wig, including one photo of him behind the bench and one showing him in front of various Elvis posters and memorabilia.",
      "The images elicited bemused reaction from local attorneys, including Brendan Roediger, who quipped to St. Louis Magazine: \"Suspicious minds are wondering about the punishment. It's now or never\u2014either he should be a judge or he shouldn't.\"",

    "story": [
      "A 23-year-old Wisconsin woman who stabbed a classmate nearly to death 11 years ago to please the fictional horror character Slender Man has been captured in Illinois after cutting off a monitoring bracelet, leaving a group home and going missing, Madison, Wisconsin officials said late Sunday night.",
      "Morgan Geyser was found at a truck stop in Posen, Illinois, the Posen Police Department confirmed early Monday. Posen is about 25 miles south of Chicago and 170 miles south of Madison.",
      "Geyser was found with a 42-year-old friend who was charged with criminal trespassing and obstructing identification, Posen police said. The friend has since been released from custody.",
      "Geyser had been last seen around 8 p.m. Saturday with an adult acquaintance, city officials said.",
      "The Madison Police Department said Sunday that it wasn't made aware that Geyser was missing until nearly 12 hours after she left the group home. The state Department of Corrections received an alert Saturday night that Geyser's ankle monitor had malfunctioned. The department contacted the group home where she lived about two hours later and was told she wasn't there and had removed the bracelet, police said.",
      "Police released a recent image of Geyser that was captured on security video.",
      "Geyser has been living in a group home after she was released earlier this year from Winnebago Mental Health Institute, a psychiatric hospital where she had spent the last seven years. She was released after three experts testified she had made progress battling mental illness.",
      "The friend who was with Geyser spoke to CBS News Chicago reporter Asal Rezael after being released from police custody on a charge of obstruction for initially giving police a false identity. The friend, who declined to share their name, said they didn't want Geyser to be alone, so the two of them hopped on a bus from Madison to Chicago and eventually just started walking. According to the friend, Geyser injured her foot during the trip and wasn't able to go on any longer, and they were detained at a truck stop after someone called the police on them for loitering.",
      "An extradition hearing is set for Tuesday on sending Geyser back to Wisconsin.",
      "In 2014, Geyser and her friend, Anissa Weier,\u00a0lured Payton Leutner to a Waukesha park after a sleepover. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier egged her on. All three girls were 12 years old at the time.",
      "Geyser and Weier fled after the attack but were arrested as they were walking on Interstate 94. They told investigators they attacked Leutner to earn the right to be Slender Man's servants and feared he would hurt their families if they didn't follow through. They had planned to walk to Slender Man's mansion in northern Wisconsin after the attack, they said.",
      "Leutner barely survived.\u00a0Geyser ultimately pleaded guilty\u00a0to being a party to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in 2017 but claimed she wasn't responsible because she was mentally ill. The following year, Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren had committed her to a psychiatric hospital for 40 years.",
      "Weier pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree intentional homicide with a dangerous weapon in 2017, but like Geyser, claimed she was mentally ill and not responsible for her actions. She was committed to 25 years in a mental hospital but was granted release in 2021 after agreeing to live with her father and to wear a GPS monitor.",

    "story": [
      "The granddaughter of late President John F. Kennedy,\u00a0Tatiana Schlossberg, announced Saturday that she has less than a year to live amid a cancer diagnosis.",
      "The 35-year-old journalist published an essay in the New Yorker magazine, writing that after she gave birth to her second child, a baby girl, in May 2024, doctors noticed her white-blood-cell count \"looked strange.\"",
      "She wrote in the magazine that she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, with a rare mutation called Inversion 3, shortly afterward. Schlossberg, who has been married to Dr. George Moran since 2017, wrote that she couldn't believe this was happening.",
      "\"I did not\u2014could not\u2014believe that they were talking about me,\" she wrote. \"I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.\"",
      "\"I had a son whom I loved more than anything and a newborn I need to take care of,\" she wrote.",
      "Schlossberg described grueling rounds of treatment including chemotherapy, several clinical trials and two bone marrow transplants, including one from her sister, Rose. But the cancer recurred, and her doctor told her he could keep her \"alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "Another tragedy hits the Kennedy family",
      "The second of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg's three children, Schlossberg said she received care at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City. She wrote searingly in her essay of the guilt she felt over another tragedy hitting the famous Kennedy family.",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she wrote.",
      "Caroline Kennedy, who served\u00a0as the U.S. ambassador to Australia and Japan, lost her father, President John F. Kennedy, when he was assassinated\u00a0on Nov. 22, 1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald \u2014 the same day, 62 years later, her daughter published her essay announcing her cancer diagnosis. She also lost her uncle Bobby Kennedy when he was shot and killed in 1968 while he was campaigning for the presidency.",
      "Caroline Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,\u00a0died in 1994 at age 64 following a diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr.,\u00a0died in a plane crash\u00a0off the coast of Massachusetts in 1999.",
      "Kennedy's cousin, Maria Shriver, urged people on social media\u00a0on Saturday to read Schlossberg's story to see what \"a beautiful writer, journalist, wife, mother, daughter, sister, and friend\" has been going through for the last year and a half. Shriver said to let the story \"be a reminder to be grateful for the life you are living today, right now, this very minute.\"",
      "Collecting memories",
      "Schlossberg spends a portion of her essay writing about her family's dismay regarding the\u00a0nomination and confirmation\u00a0of her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services. She spoke about how he cut nearly half a billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines and slashed funding from the National Institutes of Health. She wrote that hundreds of National Institute of Health grants and clinical trials were canceled.",
      "She wrote that she worries millions of women might not get the care they deserve after she was given a dose of misoprostol to stop her postpartum hemorrhage. Because the drug can also be used as part of medication abortion, it is currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration, she wrote, due to her cousin's urging.",
      "Schlossberg mostly focused on writing about her family, how she is going to miss living life with her \"kind, funny, handsome genius\" husband she managed to find, and what would happen to her two young children growing up without their mother.",
      "\"Mostly I try to live and be with them now,\" she wrote in The New Yorker. But she says that it is harder than it seems and tries to fill herself up with memories of her children, which she hopes she can carry with her after she is gone.",
      "\"Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead,\" Schlossberg wrote.",

      "Another read, \"I cannot continue to serve in such a hostile and toxic work environment.\"",
      "Amid a growing wave of firings, resignations and retirements from the Justice Department, some former agency officials are curating a public online display of the farewell messages of ousted employees. Some of the letters from purged non-political career Justice Department attorneys warn of a threat to democracy and a crumbling of the norms and standards in federal prosecutions.",
      "Justice Connection, a group of former Justice Department employees, has organized and posted the online page of goodbye messages. The organization's executive director and founder, Stacey Young, a former civil division attorney for the Justice Department, said the Justice Department purge has now eclipsed 5,000 employees since January, including resignations, firings and retirements.",
      "Some of those ousted have included high-profile department leaders, who wrote farewell messages expressing their fears about the trajectory of the Justice Department as agency employees have been purged.",
      "\"These messages are from people who are trying to encapsulate the thought of losing their careers,\" said Peter Carr, a longtime Justice Department public affairs specialist who was fired earlier this year. Carr, now a spokesperson for Justice Connection, told CBS News, \"Somebody needed to capture all of these letters, so that they're not lost to history.\"",
      "\"These messages show what is happening in our country at this moment,\" he said.",
      "One of the messages posted was written by Maurene Comey, a former New York-based federal prosecutor, who is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey and previously handled part of the criminal case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. When she was fired this year, Maureen Comey wrote, \"If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain. . . . Do not let that happen.\"",
      "\"Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought,\" she continued. \"Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns at the heart of this place.\"",

      "\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion, Scotten wrote. \"But it was never going to be me.\"",
      "Patty Hartman, who was fired in April from her communications position in the U.S. Attorney's Office for Washington, D.C., told CBS News she especially wanted to share a goodbye message with her team, because her firing was unexpected, abrupt and resulted in immediately losing access to her government-issued phone and computer.",
      "\"The people in charge who are supposed to protect us\u2014 our fellow Americans who we elected, along with those who were appointed, and swore an OATH to protect this nation and our Constitution \u2014 now use the Constitution as a weapon to suit their own ends,\" Hartman's farewell message said.",
      "\"When someone disappears from the office without notice, there's a tendency to think they did something wrong,\" Hartman told CBS News. \"It was important for me to publicly acknowledge my illegal termination because so many others were experiencing it and, quite frankly, I was pissed off.\"",
      "The Justice Department declined a request to comment to CBS News about the firings, resignations or the online farewell messages.",
      "Michael Romano, a prosecutor who handled some Jan. 6 prosecutions, noted his work on Capitol insurrection cases when he resigned in March.",
      "\"Many rioters saw their relationship with the rule of law as transactional, as they demonstrated when they told police officers that they had 'backed the blue' in the past and thus, that the officers should stand down or join the mob . . . .,\" he wrote in his message. \"They expected, in other words,\u00a0 that the rule of law did not apply to them. And, but for the work of the Capitol Siege Section, they would have been right.\"",
      "Romano told CBS News, \"It was important to have my colleagues see me standing up for the work we did. I needed to say it and people needed to hear it.\"",
      "Meredith Burrell, a former civil rights office attorney, wrote in her message, \"We were entrusted with the serious responsibility of engaging the power of the federal government to use the rule of law to vindicate the rights of marginalized people . . .\u00a0 I am still processing the contrast between those 25 years and the last four months.\"",
      "Other farewell messages are limited to praise of colleagues and law enforcement. Greg Rosen, who resigned in May after serving as the head of the unit that prosecuted Capitol riot cases, wrote in his message, \"To those who partnered with me on the January 6 investigation and prosecution: you represent the highest ideals of our nation\u2014unwavering in your commitment to the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power. To the officers who were injured, physically and emotionally, protecting the greatest legislative body in the world: thank you. You are the embodiment of heroism.\"",
      "Sybil Barksdale, a former official in the agency's Office of Violence against Women, wrote in her message, \"Throughout my career, through changing administrations, evolving legal landscapes, and countless initiatives, I had the privilege of working alongside exceptional colleagues who shared an unwavering dedication to justice and protecting those most vulnerable.\"",
      "A resigned FBI analyst wrote, \"If I learned anything in the FBI, it is that yes, you can say no. If something is wrong, unjust, or unethical, you speak up, and sometimes speaking up means saying 'no.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that the suggested legal recognition of Russian sovereignty over captured territory in the east of his country remained a \"main problem\" in negotiations as President Trump pushes for a deal to end Moscow's nearly-four-year war on Ukraine.",
      "Ukrainian and American officials met over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss a 28-point proposal floated last week by the White House. They discussed the possibility of Zelenskyy visiting the U.S. this week as part of Mr. Trump's bid to get an agreement by Thanksgiving, CBS News' Margaret Brennan reported, citing multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the Thanksgiving deadline as flexible, and he told reporters Saturday that the plan presented last week was \"not my final\" proposal.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Geneva for the weekend talks, said \"very, very meaningful\" progress was made with the Ukrainian and European delegations, but that \"there's still some work left to do and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Addressing Sweden's parliament on Monday, Zelenskyy made it clear one of the key points of contention over the U.S. proposal was a call for Ukraine and the global community to formally recognize some portion of the ground Russian forces have occupied by force as no longer Ukrainian.",
      "\"Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That's the main problem. You all understand what that means.\"",
      "Finland's President Alexander Stubb said there were still \"major issues which remain to be resolved\" regarding the U.S. peace proposal, though he also welcomed progress made during the high-stakes talks in Geneva.",
      "Rubio struck a more optimistic tone in describing the weekend talks, saying Sunday that the session in Geneval was \"probably the most productive day we have had on this issue\" since President Trump came back into office for his second term in January.",
      "Rubio stressed that there was more work to do and said he didn't want to \"declare victory or finality.\"",
      "The top U.S. diplomat was pressed by reporters but would not offer any insight into which issues were the main sticking points in the peace talks. He called the proposal a \"living, breathing document\" and said he believed the issues that remained unsettled were \"not insurmountable.\"",
      "The White House said in a statement Sunday night that U.S. and Ukrainian officials \"drafted an updated and refined peace framework\" following their discussions, but Russia's government said Monday that the revisions had not been shared, and that it would reserve judgement.",
      "Putin said Friday that the U.S. proposal could serve as the basis of a negotiated resolution to what his government has refused to acknowledge as a war, but he warned that if Ukraine turned down the plan, Russian forces would remain on the attack, seizing yet more ground.",
      "\"We are, of course, closely monitoring the media reports that have been pouring in from Geneva over the past few days,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, \"but we have not yet received anything official.\"",
      "\"We read a statement that, following the discussions in Geneva, some amendments had been made to the text which we had seen earlier. We will wait. It seems that the dialogue is continuing,\" he said, adding that there were no plans for a meeting this week between Russian and U.S. officials on the topic, but that Moscow remained open to dialogue.",
      "The 28-point plan, which U.S. officials said last week had Mr. Trump's backing, sparked alarm among America's European allies for being perceived as too favorable to Russia.",
      "Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that her country had not agreed to all of the terms in the draft plan, which was leaked to media outlets last week.",

    "summary": "President Trump called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday called for the U.S. to weigh labeling some Middle Eastern affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, taking aim at the controversial Islamist movement.",
      "In an executive order, the president directed his administration to consider whether to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations. He gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 30 days to submit a report, and 45 days after that to take action.",
      "The order claimed the three countries' Muslim Brotherhood affiliates \"engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns.\"",
      "It accused the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood's Lebanese chapter of helping launch rockets at Israel after the terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and alleged a leader of the Egyptian chapter \"encouraged violent attacks against U.S. partners\" after the attack.",
      "The White House also said members of the Jordanian chapter have \"long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas,\" itself a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.",
      "If the groups are designated as foreign terrorist organizations, it would become illegal under U.S. law to knowingly provide funding or other material support to them. The designation can also lead to travel bans against members or the freezing of funds held in U.S. banks.",
      "Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood is an influential political movement in much of the Middle East. The leader of a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political party, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi was ousted by the military the following year.",
      "Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt and elsewhere have renounced violence. But the group has long been controversial, with critics \u2014 including U.S. allies \u2014 saying some affiliated groups have engaged in violence or espoused extremist views. Egypt's military government formally banned the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and Jordan banned the group earlier this year.",
      "\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet.",
      "Mr. Trump's order comes about a week after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and banned it from buying land. Abbott made a similar move toward the Council on American-Islamic Relations, drawing a lawsuit from the civil rights group.",
      "The president has used the executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations broadly.",
      "His administration labeled several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year, and recently applied the designation to Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as the administration puts more pressure on the Venezuelan government and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Some analysts say it's not a centralized drug cartel in the traditional sense, but is instead a loosely defined network of government officials accused of links to organized crime and drug trafficking.",
      "The administration earlier this year also designated four European groups that it said are affiliated with antifa.

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:21:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has designated the Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization, but some say the Venezuelan entity is \"not a group\" at all.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government's designation of the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization officially took effect Monday as part of President Trump's aggressive campaign to combat drug trafficking into the United States. The U.S. identifies Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the group's leader \u2014 and he says the claims of narcoterrorism are actually part of a bid by Mr. Trump to force him from power.",
      "The terrorist designation, which was announced last week, is designed to put more pressure on Maduro, even as U.S. warships and more than 10,000 American troops step up training exercises in the region. The U.S. military has also launched deadly strikes on boats it alleges were carrying drugs off Venezuela's coast \u2014 many of them allegedly run by the Tren de Aragua gang, which the U.S. accuses of ties to the Maduro regime.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, Maduro's government said it \"absolutely rejects the new and ridiculous fabrication\" designating \"the nonexistent Cartel of the Suns as a terrorist organization, thus repeating an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela, under the classic U.S. format of regime change.\"",
      "Ahead of the designation announcement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed the group was \"responsible for terrorist violence \u2026 as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "The Cartel de los Soles was also hit in July with U.S. economic sanctions, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said highlighted \"the illegitimate Maduro regime's facilitation of narco-terrorism through terrorist groups like Cartel de los Soles.\"",
      "What is \u2014 and what isn't \u2014 the Cartel de los Soles?",
      "But what is the so-called Cartel of the Suns? It is not, in the traditional sense, a Latin American drug cartel along the lines of the family-run Sinaloa or the Jalisco New Generation.",
      "The \"suns\" in the name refers to the insignia used for decades to adorn the uniforms of high-ranking Venezuelan military officers.",
      "Venezuelans, including prosecutors and other officials, started using the term colloquially in the 1990s to refer to the cadre of high-ranking military officers who'd grown rich from facilitating drug-running. As corruption expanded across the country, first under the late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and then under Maduro as his successor, analysts say the term came to encompass the loosely defined network of police and government officials that facilitated and profited off of activities ranging from illegal mining to fuel and drug trafficking.",
      "The term was first elevated to define an alleged Maduro-led drug trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department, during President Trump's first administration, announced indictments of Venezuela's leader and members of his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges. The Justice Department accused Maduro, through the Cartel de los Soles, of working directly with the Colombian rebel group FARC to traffic cocaine through Venezuela to the U.S.",
      "The designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization has generally been reserved for groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, but the Trump administration has expanded its use to designate eight Latin American organizations accused of drug trafficking and people smuggling, calling it an effort to counter narcoterrorism.",
      "Some analysts say it's a stretch to even define the Cartel de los Soles as a single unified organization.",
      "\"It is not a group,\" Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America think tank told The Associated Press. \"It's not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don't have regular meetings. They don't have a hierarchy.\"",
      "\"It is not a hierarchical or ideological group,\" agrees the InSight Crime outlet, which is run by two former journalists who covered Latin America extensively for decades. \"Its structure consists of a diffuse network of cells embedded within Venezuela's main military branches: the army, the navy, the air force, and the national guard, from the lowest to the highest ranks.\"",
      "\"Although the concept is primarily associated with the military sector, other branches of the [Venezuelan] State embedded within the criminal ecosystem have also been identified, including police forces, the executive branch, and various public officials,\" InSight Crime said in an analysis of the purported cartel published in September.",
      "Terrorist designation comes amid U.S. military strikes and build-up",
      "In recent weeks, the U.S. military has conducted at least 21 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing dozens of people and sparking a debate in Washington about the legality of the extrajudicial attacks.",
      "The Trump administration has carried out the strikes without providing evidence to support its assertions that the boats are carrying drugs and operated by criminal organizations. It says the attacks, which began in late September off the coast of Venezuela and expanded to the eastern Pacific, are meant to stop narcotics reaching American soil.",
      "But Maduro, and some others, see the U.S. military operations and massive buildup of hardware in the region as an effort to precipitate his ouster \u2014   if not the prelude to an overt operation to topple his government.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said the formal designation of the Cartel de los Soles will give a \"whole bunch of new options to the United States\" to address Maduro's alleged crimes.",
      "But speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, he declined to give details on what those options included, or to say whether the U.S. military was planning to carry out strikes on targets inside Venezuela.",
      "\"Nothing is off the table, but nothing's automatically on the table,\" he said.",
      "Since American troops and hardware \u2014   including the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's most advanced aircraft carrier \u2014   started pouring into the Caribbean earlier this year, Venezuela's U.S.-backed political opposition has been more confidently voicing its perennial promise to see Maduro forced from office, fueling speculation over the real endgame of what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation.",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell during an extensive interview for 60 Minutes just weeks ago whether the U.S. operations around Venezuela were about \"getting rid of Maduro,\" President Trump said they were \"about many things,\" but he said the Venezuelan leader's days in office were likely numbered.",

      "The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in Ethiopia's Afar region about 500 miles northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border, erupted on Sunday for several hours.",
      "The volcano, which rises about 1,500 feet yards in altitude, sits within the Rift Valley, a zone of intense geological activity where two tectonic plates meet.",
      "Ash clouds from the volcano drifted over Yemen, Oman, India, and northern Pakistan, said the VAAC, which posted a map of the path of the ash cloud.",
      "Simon Carn, a volcanologist and professor at the Michigan Technological University,\u00a0confirmed on Bluesky\u00a0that the ash cloud was \"spreading rapidly east in the subtropical jet stream, over the Arabian Sea towards NW India and Pakistan.\"",

      "A local administrator, Mohammed Seid, said there were no casualties, but the eruption could have economic implications for the local community of livestock herders.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",
      "Federal government figures indicate there are currently 3,969 people enrolled in the Myanmar TPS program. Unless a court intervenes, the program will expire in late January.",

      "A pocket watch that once belonged to one of the Titanic's most renowned passengers has sold at an auction for $2.3 million \u2014 a record price for memorabilia related to the historic shipwreck, according to the auction house.",
      "The 18-carat gold watch was gifted to its original owner, Isidor Straus, by his wife, Ida Straus, for his 43rd birthday, said Henry Aldridge and Son, the auction house that sold it on Saturday. It was recovered from his body after the Titanic sunk in the North Atlantic in April 1912.",
      "Isidor Straus was an American businessman and politician who owned the Macy's department store in New York City. He and his wife were first-class passengers on the Titanic during its maiden voyage from England to New York, and the couple are remembered for their final act of selflessness while on board.",
      "Witnesses who survived the Titanic wreck said afterward that the Strauses were offered two seats on a lifeboat once the ship had struck an iceberg, according to the U.K. government's\u00a0National Archives. But Isidor Straus refused his seat, instead insisting that it should have been offered to younger men, and Ida Straus followed him, reportedly saying, \"Where you go, I go.\"",
      "According to those archives, Isidor and Ida Straus were last seen standing arm in arm on the deck of the Titanic, before a wave crashed overhead and washed them out to sea. The Strauses were the ancestors of Wendy Rush, wife of OceanGate founder Stockton Rush, who died in the infamous Titan submersible explosion in 2023 en route to the Titanic wreck site.",
      "Straus' pocket watch exceeded the previous record sale for a piece of the Titanic's history memorabilia by about $300,000, according to Henry Aldridge and Son. The previous record was set for another gold pocket watch, which sold an auction last year for about $1.97 million. It had been gifted by Titanic survivors to the captain of the RMS Carpathia, who steered his ship toward the Titanic wreck on the night it sunk and ultimately rescued hundreds of passengers still afloat on life boats, according to the auction house.",
      "\"Pocket watches are incredibly personal items,\" said Andrew Aldridge, managing director of the auction house, in a statement. \"Every man, woman and child passenger or crew had a story to tell and they are told 113 years later through the objects that they owned. Items like this keep the story alive and bring us closer to the memory of one of the biggest tragedies of the 20th century.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 08:51:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Jimmy Cliff, who famously sang about the \"many rivers\" we all must cross, has died after suffering a seizure and pneumonia, his family say.",
    "story": [
      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

      "Peshawar, Pakistan \u2014 Two suicide bombers attacked the headquarters of a security force in northwestern Pakistan on Monday morning, killing at least three officers and wounding 11 others, police and rescue officials said.",
      "The attack took place in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, when security forces were preparing for the morning parade at the sprawling facility located in the heart of the city, said Peshawar Police Chief Saeed Ahmad.",
      "He said one attacker detonated his explosives at the main gate of the provincial headquarters of the Federal Constabulary, while the second bomber was shot and killed by officers near the parking area.",
      "According to Ahmad, about 150 security personnel were on open ground inside the headquarters for morning parade drills when the attack took place. \"The terrorists involved in today's attack were on foot and failed to reach the parade area and a timely response by our forces prevented a much larger tragedy,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "He said police had completed the clearance operation and authorities had collected samples of the body parts of the attackers for DNA tests. He added police are still investigating to determine the identity and nationality of the attackers without giving further details.",
      "Asim Khan, a spokesperson at the government-run Lady Reading Hospital, said all 11 persons wounded in the Peshawar attack were listed in stable condition.",
      "Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, condemned the attack in Peshawar, with Zardari calling it a \"cowardly act by foreign-backed terrorists,\" and Sharif saying the swift response of security forces prevented a larger tragedy. They offered condolences to the families of the victims.",
      "No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.",
      "However, the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, have been blamed for similar previous assaults in the country, which has witnessed a surge in militant attacks. The TPP is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban that leads Afghanistan.",
      "The latest attack came less than two weeks after a suicide bomber struck outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, detonating his explosives next to a police car and killing 12 people.",
      "The attacks have strained ties between Islamabad and Afghanistan's Taliban government, with Pakistan accusing the Pakistani Taliban of operating freely inside Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover in 2021.",
      "Pakistan's government often accuses Afghanistan of turning a blind eye to cross-border attacks by militants.",
      "Kabul denies the allegation, but tensions between the two sides escalated after Afghanistan blamed Pakistan for Oct. 9 drone strikes in Kabul and vowed retaliation. The ensuing fighting killed dozens of people, including soldiers, civilians and militants, before Qatar brokered a ceasefire on Oct. 19, which remains in place.",
      "It was followed by two rounds of talks in Istanbul, during which the two sides failed to reach an agreement after Afghanistan refused to give guarantees in writing about preventing the TTP from using Afghan soil for attacks inside Pakistan.",

    "story": [
      "A 33-year-old South Korean man was sentenced to life in prison Monday for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused 261 victims, including more than a dozen minors he raped or assaulted, over a four-year period before his arrest in January.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said the severity of Kim Nok-wan's crimes warrants his \"permanent isolation from society.\" It sentenced 10 accomplices to prison terms ranging from two to four years in what law enforcement authorities describe as the country's largest cybersex crime case to date.",
      "He was the head of the so-called Vigilantes: a large-scale, pyramid-style group that blackmailed victims into producing explicit content and sharing it in online chatrooms, BBC News reported. Calling himself the \"pastor\" of the group, Kim targeted both male and female victims, according to the BBC News.",
      "Starting around August 2020, Kim targeted women who posted sexually suggestive content on social media, and men attempting to join secret Telegram chat rooms for sharing digitally-manipulated sexual images of acquaintances. He threatened to expose them and coerced them into recruiting new victims, forming a pyramid-like blackmail ring on the app that produced and shared manipulated sexual images of their targets, most of whom were minors, according to details of the crimes revealed in court.",
      "Kim raped or assaulted 16 victims, including 14 minors, and recorded videos of his crimes in 13 of those cases. He created roughly 1,700 sexually exploitative images or videos targeting about 70 victims, disseminating around 260 of them online to threaten those who refused to cooperate, and also attempted to blackmail some of the victims' family members and work colleagues, the court said.",
      "\"[Kim Nok-wan] says in court that he is remorseful, but he committed countless crimes over the past four to five years,\" the court said, per BBC News. \"Considering the brutality of the crimes and the lack of restitution for victims, it is necessary to permanently isolate him from society.\"",
      "The other defendants, including five minors, knew that the victims they recruited through threats involving video and images would face the same sexual exploitation they had endured, but carried out the acts anyway to prevent their own images from being circulated, the court said.",
      "\"Most of the victims were children or adolescents, and it appears they would have suffered extreme physical and psychological pain as a result of the crimes,\" the court said in a statement.",
      "\"Digital sex crimes can rapidly amplify the damages of the victims to an irreparable level in the digital space, and once sexually exploitative materials are distributed, it's physically very difficult to completely remove them, making recovery from damage practically impossible.\"",
      "The revelation of Kim's crimes following his January arrest triggered public shock and concern over the growing risk of sexual violence enabled by digital technologies. Monday's ruling came almost five years after the same court issued a 40-year prison term for Cho Ju-bin on charges of blackmailing dozens of women, including minors, into filming sexually explicit videos and selling them to others.",

      "Manila, Philippines \u2014 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. refused to respond on Monday to an allegation by his estranged sister, a senator, that he has been a longtime drug addict whose cocaine dependence has undermined his governance, saying with a somber tone that he didn't want to discuss a family rift in public.",
      "That split has been growing since Imee Marcos publicly aligned with his political arch rival, Vice President Sara Duterte, ahead of midterm elections in May. Sara Duterte is the daughter of Rodrigo Duterte, Ferdinand Maros Jr.'s harsh critic and predecessor.",
      "Communications Undersecretary Claire Castro has said that Sen. Imee Marcos' accusations against her own brother before a huge religious rally in Manila last week were \"a web of lies\" and may have been a desperate attempt to distract from ongoing investigations into a corruption scandal that may implicate her opposition allies in the Senate.",
      "Aides have said in the past that Marcos Jr. had tested negative for cocaine and methamphetamine. When asked to respond to his elder sister's allegations, the president briefly paused and then said in a televised news conference, \"It's anathema to talk about family matters generally in public. We do not like to show our dirty linen in public.\"",
      "The president suggested that something was troubling her sister. \"The lady that you see talking on TV is not my sister and that view is shared by our cousins, friends, that it's not her,\" he said without elaborating.",
      "\"That's why we are worried, we are very worried about her. I hope she feels better soon,\" the president said. When asked if he plans to talk to her, Marcos said that he and his sister \"no longer travel in the same circles, political or otherwise.\"",
      "Marcos, 68, and his sister are children of then dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr., who was overthrown in an army-backed but largely peaceful \"people power\" uprising in 1986 after an authoritarian era that was notorious for human rights and political repression and plunder. The dictator died in exile in Hawaii in 1989. His family returned to the Philippines in 1991 and slowly regained a political foothold.",
      "Marcos Jr. won the presidency in 2022 with a landslide margin in one of the greatest political comebacks in Philippines history.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials are discussing the potential of bringing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the U.S. this week as part of President Trump's push to get an agreement on Ukraine by Thanksgiving, according to multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Whether Zelenskyy's trip happens is dependent on the outcome of peace negotiations in Geneva on Sunday, the officials said. Mr. Trump himself has described the deadline as flexible, and he told reporters on Saturday the plan was \"not my final\" proposal.",
      "Speaking from Geneva, Secretary of State Marco Rubio touted progress in discussions with a cadre of European and Ukrainian officials, but said more work would need to be done.",
      "\"I think this was a very, very meaningful \u2013 I would say probably best \u2013 meeting and day we've had so far in this entire process, going back to when we first came into office in January,\" he said. \"But there's still some work left to do and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now,\" Rubio added, promising updates after additional meetings.",
      "\"We have very good progress and we are moving forward to the just and lasting peace,\" said Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, after meeting with Rubio.",
      "There are no hard plans for a Zelenskyy visit at this moment given the active diplomacy nor are there scheduled talks with or in Russia at this point, according to a senior White House official. Another possible outcome of the negotiations in Geneva is that Army Secretary Dan Driscoll could travel to Russia or meet with Russian officials elsewhere, according to another U.S. official. Russian officials told CBS News that nothing yet is scheduled.",
      "Ukraine's response to the 28-point memo",
      "Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that her country had not agreed to all the terms in the draft 28-point peace plan that leaked to the press last week.",
      "\"This plan is not about justice and the truth of this war and the aggression,\" Stefanishyna said. \"It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.\"",
      "Stefanishyna said that Russia has not made any concessions to date and that none of the points in the leaked 28-point plan are related to forcing anything on the Russian side.",
      "In addition to the proposal, an early draft of which was leaked by an opposition politician in Ukraine and verified by the White House, there is an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Stefanishyna also confirmed that there is an additional document to the 28 points and referred to it as \"the framework of security assurances.\" She said it states the intention of the U.S. to provide something along the lines of Article 5 of the Washington NATO Treaty, such as a defense promise. However, unlike that NATO guarantee, the security assurances do not have a detailed layout of security guarantees nor the weight of Congressional approval and backing that would come with a treaty. That is a challenge for Ukraine, Stefanishyna said, in part because of past failures by the West to live up to security assurances given when Ukraine handed over its nuclear weapons as part of the 1994 Budapest memorandum.",
      "Why now?",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2013 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct. While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official",
      "said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",
      "Inter-Trump administration confusion",
      "There were separate but parallel diplomatic efforts on Ukraine taking place within the Trump administration that are now being merged.",
      "Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff have been working on what they refer to as a \"term sheet\" to end the war, mimicking their broad-strokes proposal for a Gaza ceasefire. While the Trump administration put sanctions on Russian oil and gas to bring Putin to the negotiating table, Putin advisor Kirill Dmitriev was already at a table in Miami talking to Witkoff at the end of last month.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the time dismissed Dmitriev as a \"Russian propagandist,\" but it was Dmitriev who helped draft this 28-point proposal that the U.S. is now backing. A senior White House official told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were kept \"apprised\" of those talks, which happened in Miami last month. At a time when Zelenskyy is facing a domestic political scandal at home, the Kushner-Witkoff term sheet leaked to the press via an opposition politician in Ukraine and through an interview Dmitriev did with Axios.",
      "On Saturday, a number of senators, including Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, as well as Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, said that Rubio had explained to them that the 28-point proposal was not of American origin and assured them that he personally had not heard of any threat to cut off U.S. military and intelligence sharing with Ukraine if it did not agree to terms. Rubio posted Saturday on social media that the \"plan was authored by the U.S.\"",
      "However, a Ukrainian official and a U.S. official told CBS News that the threat had been made during talks with other senior U.S. officials in Kyiv. Driscoll, a close friend of Vance's, led a delegation there last week. He's now in Geneva as part of talks.",
      "A senior White House official acknowledged to CBS News that the threat to cut off aid to Ukraine may have been implied but not explicitly stated during talks with Ukraine's leadership when U.S. officials said that Mr. Trump is getting \"weary and frustrated\" and cannot keep doing this forever.",
      "The same senior White House official told CBS News that Vance and Rubio held a call Saturday night with Driscoll and U.S. military leadership in order to answer questions from lawmakers. Rubio made additional phone calls to lawmakers, which Shaheen, King and Rounds detailed",
      "\"There are many problems with the plan as it has been reported, but the two most obvious are that it rewards Russia's illegal and unprovoked aggression by handing over substantial portions of Ukraine's sovereign territory, and its security guarantees against further Russian aggression are vague and inadequate,\" Senator King said in a statement Sunday. \"I hope that after consultation with Ukraine and the Europeans, a more fair and responsible agreement will emerge.\"",
      "When did the Army become involved in diplomacy?",
      "Driscoll has been in contact with Ukrainian officials in recent weeks and was originally planning to go to Ukraine in mid-December to discuss drone technology, but he was recently asked by Mr. Trump to restart talks about a ceasefire. Driscoll's role in the talks has involved details of the security guarantees being given to Ukraine.",
      "Driscoll combined his two missions on this trip. While Driscoll was en route to Ukraine, the 28-point plan was leaked by an anti-Zelenskyy politician. After this point, the Driscoll mission was \"adjusted\" to involve the emerging diplomacy building off the leaked Kushner-Witkoff term sheet, according to multiple U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "The U.S. officials declined to discuss details of how the 28-point plan, or the additional security guarantee document have changed in the past few days.",
      "Vance has been a driving force behind the Ukraine diplomacy, according to a European diplomat and a source familiar. His close friend Driscoll has become a key conduit.",
      "Political implications",
      "The Trump administration has been reaching out in the past few days to respond to senators and congressmen including powerful, pro-Ukraine Republicans who are upset with the reported concessions being asked of Ukraine. Republican Rep Mike McCaul, chair emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, publicly acknowledged the outreach from Vance-Rubio and said he was assured it was a U.S. proposal not a Russian one.",
      "The Trump administration is sensitive to the idea of a rift between Rubio and Witkoff. It was Witkoff who engineered the August summit with Putin in Alaska.",
      "There has been much retroactive policymaking and recasting of events as we're seeing from the on camera remarks made by Rubio's old colleagues who may recall he was a Russia hawk during his Senate days. Since his time in the Senate, Vance has been consistent in arguing that Ukraine should not be a top priority for the U.S. Meanwhile, Witkoff has been trying to get Mr. Trump the deal to end the war that he so desires.",

      "\"I INHERITED A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, A WAR THAT IS A LOSER FOR EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE SO NEEDLESSLY DIED.

GOD BLESS ALL THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE HUMAN CATASTROPHE! President DJT.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has set a Thursday deadline for Ukraine to respond to the plan. But he also has suggested that he could push that back if there was proof of real progress and that the plan was not his final offer.",
      "The 28-point blueprint drawn up by the U.S. sparked alarm in Kyiv and across Europe, quickly rallying Western allies around Ukraine in a push to revise the plan, which is seen as favoring Moscow. They said in a joint statement on Saturday that while the plan \"includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace,\" additional work is required. The plan acquiesces to many of Russia's demands that Ukraine has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory.",
      "After the first session, Rubio said, \"This will ultimately have to be signed off by our presidents, although I feel very comfortable about that happening given the progress we've made.\" He was joined at the talks by U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Russia will also need to approve the final peace plan, Rubio said.",
      "The head of the Ukrainian delegation, presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, also confirmed an initial session of talks had concluded and that a second meeting would soon take place.",
      "After Mr. Trump's post, Zelenskyy cheered U.S.-led efforts on security, but stressed that \"the crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war.\"",
      "\"Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump for the assistance that \u2013 starting with the Javelins \u2013 has been saving Ukrainian lives. We thank everyone in Europe, in the G7, and in the G20 who is helping us defend life. It is important to preserve the support.",
      "\"It is important not to forget the main goal \u2013 to stop Russia's war and prevent it from ever igniting again.\"",
      "\"The leadership of the United States is important, we are grateful for everything that America and President Trump are doing for security, and we remain as constructive as possible,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers said Saturday that Rubio had privately described the plan as a Russian \"wish list\" rather than a Washington-led proposal. The bipartisan group of senators held a news conference, stating that they had spoken with Rubio about the peace plan after he reached out to some of them while en route to Geneva. Independent Maine Sen. Angus King said Rubio told them the plan \"was not the administration's plan\" but a \"wish list of the Russians.\"",
      "Rubio on Saturday night rejected the claims,\u00a0writing\u00a0in a social media post that, \"The peace proposal was authored by the U.S. It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations. It is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott denied their account, calling it \"blatantly false.\"",
      "\"As Secretary Rubio and the entire Administration has consistently maintained, this plan was authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians,\" he posted on social media.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Olga Stefanishyna, Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S., that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Olga Stefanishyna. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Welcome, Margaret, hello.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand this is a very intense week for your country for a number of reasons, including the diplomacy that's happening right now as we sit here in Geneva. Your president said Ukraine faces a choice between losing its dignity or losing a key ally, the United States. What has been agreed to at this point?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well as- as it is known, the consultation are still ongoing between Ukraine and the American officials. This is Secretary of State Rubio, and also Secretary of Army Driscoll, who arrived a little bit earlier. These consultations are still continue on the basis of the proposal of the American side on 28 point peace plan, as it's been called here. And European allies are also present in Geneva these days to work hand in hand with the Ukrainian delegation, but also with the American delegation to discuss the proposals on our and on their side. So the consultations are still ongoing, but there has been a number of points which have been already widely discussed in public.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you aware of Russia making any concessions at this point?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well, it does not seem this way from the proposal which is on the table. In fact- in fact, none of the points are actually related to- to forcing anything on the Russian side. Of course, it's recognized that it is- it is aggression. There is a number of points related to return of hostages and- and prisoners of war, of a humanitarian nation. But this is definitely not about the justice. This plan is not about the justice and the truth of this war and- and the aggression. It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's unfair to Ukraine, you're saying.",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well again, I think this should be divided. This plan is not about justice, you know, and this plan is about a number of actions proposed as part of estimated agreement between Ukraine and potentially Russian Federation. Ukraine is in intensive engagement in a very constructive way with the American side and under the umbrella of U.S. leadership, these discussions are ongoing, and we believe that the fair peace is not the words, but this is something that should be put on paper. So, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you been told that the United States will cut off military and intelligence sharing if President Zelenskyy doesn't agree to this plan by Thursday?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: I think it's- it's totally unfair to- to American colleagues and partners to quote this or that statements which were weighed- which were done in course of, you know, various meetings and phone calls. There was quite a few, you know, we had a first senior military visit to Ukraine by Secretary of Army Driscoll since- since we gained the independence in 1991. And I had a meeting with him as well here in Washington. And his role is extremely- extremely clear to us. We also had an engagement between president and vice president on a phone call. There was, like, a lot of discussions. Some of them were more emotional. Some were- them were less emotional, but here we are. We are sitting together and looking for a solution to end the war, and Russia is not part of this process formally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the- the Wall Street Journal is reporting that in addition to those 28 points, there's a separate document that has to do with security guarantees. I have also been told that there's a separate document with security guarantees.",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Journal is reporting that it's 10 years of support, but it doesn't commit the U.S. to provide direct military assistance. What guarantees do you want from the United States?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well, there is a separate document called the framework, like of the security assurances from the United States. So this is not the agreement. This is not the treaty. This is not the- the- the formal or detailed layout of what security guarantees is. That is the like document specifying the intention that U.S. government is committed to providing security assurances, which are like something like the Article 5 of the Washington NATO Treaty. So it's- it's still very different, and it specifies it's been in a public access so it's been publicly leaked as well, so, that U.S. will stand up together with the allies, in case of the Russian aggression from the territory of the Russian Federation. I think we should not forget that the Russian aggression started, in fact, from Belarusian territory. So they're, like, a lot of nuances, and this is to be discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, I see. So you're saying you want a clear security guarantee that says if you're invaded, or if you're attacked, including by surrounding countries that are Russian proxies. You want America to say that it will come to Ukraine's defense?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Yeah, absolutely. We can really speak about security assurances where we have, like the real document in front of our eyes and what is really important that we had- we are very complicated partner for U.S., because we also had a lot of different sad experiences, like Budapest Memorandum where we gave up nuclear weapons that we had, another of different situations where we have learned our lessons and we face the aggression for three and a half year and we learned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you. U.S. and European officials tell me that the trajectory on the battlefield for Ukraine is not good, particularly in that key industrial city of Pokrovsk --",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: -- Pokrovsk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pokrovsk. And that Russia will likely take control of this, and that this is sort of a gateway to the eastern part, that the Donbas. How do you respond to the argument that Ukraine is losing on the battlefield and that you need to negotiate now?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well, Ukraine is one of the largest European countries, and on the regular, within one week, there are more than 1,000 combat engagements happening on all the front line, and Russia is trying to present that it's only happening in Pokrovsk, right? So this is a victorious narrative Russia is using as a tactics of pressuring or changing the reality also here in the United States. That's why I mean Pokrovsk is a very important spot on the front line, but definitely not the only one.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Welcome back to the program, Senator. A lot to get to, but on this concern about political violence or angry rhetoric, I know the President himself has survived these two attempts on his life. You talked to us about those risks to him. And then we had this killing of Charlie Kirk just a few months ago. Is the President holding himself to the same standard that he is asking of others when it comes to dialing back dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: You know, everybody knows that the President is famous for his unfiltered social media. But if you take at face value the idea that calling your opponents traitors and then specifically saying that it warrants the death penalty is reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible, there are a number of other ways to describe it, but it's not something that is helping the country heal wounds. I think it stirs things up and- and really, I think we can do better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the homeland security front, I understand you are chair of that committee, and so you have some insight into some of these domestic threats. It's not just these Democratic lawmakers. We saw out in the state of Indiana, four Republican state senators were targeted by swatting threats amid President Trump's public pressure on them to redistrict their state. Just a few weeks ago, we did see one of the convicted January 6 rioters who was then pardoned by President Trump arrested for threatening to kill Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Are we at the point here where it's not just unfiltered social media posts, but truly dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Well, you know, I've been on the receiving side of this. Even my father, who's been retired for some time, has been on the receiving end of swatting. Police are called. Says there's an emergency in the home, and the goal is to, you know, have someone draw a gun and be killed as the police come in, supposedly to rescue someone who's not really in need of being rescued. So, I think both sides have been doing this, and I think the language on treason and traitors, both to Republicans and Democrats, is, as I said, reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that- so one of the other developments we've seen just over the weekend is that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican from Georgia, just a staunch supporter for so long of the President, has said she is going to step away because she's paid such a public price for some of her positions. Do you think there is room in your party for disagreeing with President Trump?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: I think it's important that we have independent voices. So, I'm sad to see her voice go away, or potentially go away. I think that she brought up something in the last week or so that was very important. What is the Republican plan for health care? So, I've engaged the President on this, and I'm putting forward my own plan. But in my plan, what it allows for is people to buy their insurance through a collective. Basically to buy their insurance through Costco or Sam's Club or Amazon. And mine is the only plan out there that would actually drive prices down. But that's what an independent voice will help in our country. Independent voice within the Republican caucus, not to see things always inside the box, but to think of some out of the box solutions. So, I think independent voices are important in the Republican Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because of your position on Homeland Security, you may have some insight into the drug cartels. You are also on Senate Foreign Relations, and it is tomorrow that the Trump administration officially will designate the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. That's the cartel the Trump administration says is linked to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Secretary Hegseth, says it gives the administration new tools. Nothing's on or off the table, he says, militarily. Legally, what changes tomorrow? What becomes possible?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: I think by doing this, they're pretending as if we are at war. They're pretending as if they've gotten some imprimatur to do what they want. When you have war, the rules of engagement are lessened. So, for example, we normally don't shoot boats that we suspect of being drug dealers. In fact, if the Coast Guard tomorrow started shooting all vessels that are off of Miami or off of San Diego, about one in four of the vessels that they normally board doesn't have drugs. So it actually would be unlawful if the Coast Guard started blowing up boats. But for some reason they say, oh, we're at war off the coast of Venezuela. And so it's different rule of engagement. It's one of war. But you know, Senator Kaine and I brought this up, and we said, if it's war, let's- let's declare it as war. Let's have this discussion. Is it war or not? And the administration refused that. They want to have it both ways. They want to say, Oh, we can just say these people are terrorists, are narco-terrorists, so we can blow them up. But it's extraordinary that when some of them survive, they pluck them out of the water. They don't prosecute them for drugs. They don't collect drugs. They don't tell us if they were armed or not. They just send them back to their country, most of the time, not being Venezuela. They've sent one back to Colombia and one back to Ecuador, but nobody's making any pretense of even interviewing them to find out who's selling you the drugs. Maybe we could find out who the kingpins are if they're involved in the drug trade. Not a word. And I've been given zero, not one briefing, because I'm skeptical of what they're doing. They don't brief me or the general Senate at all. A few hand selected people may have gotten a briefing, but I have not been invited to any briefings on Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's fairly unusual, given your homeland security role, and that the premise for some of this action has to do with both immigration and drug policy, according to the President. I know the DEA administrator recently spoke to our Nicole Sganga and told her that they have seen between a 30% to 45% increase in cocaine prices per kilogram due to these DoD boat strikes and a shift towards land routes for delivery of those drugs. In other words, there's still demand for the drugs and the cartels are just finding different routes to deliver them. Have you seen any evidence that the President's actions to date are winning a drug war?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I think we should be trying to work on the demand side, treating it as a health problem, as an addiction problem in our country, and trying to lessen the demand. And that is part of the overall solution, the war on drugs, though, to capture all the people selling drugs. The price goes up and more people are attracted to it. You know, a couple of the people that have been identified as being on these boats are simply down on their luck, people with no prospects who are offered $500 to get on a boat and race across the ocean, and so there always will be those people. There's probably a limitless number of those people in South America. There's been some benefit when we've cooperated with countries and with governments. But that's not what this is, and I fear that this is not going to do anything for the drug trade, but it is really going against the rule of law in the way in which we interact with people on the high seas, and it has no precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I've seen you quoted as saying there are people in the administration who have wanted to go to war in Venezuela for some time. Who are you talking about?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think it's clear that Senator Rubio, as a senator, was very much an advocate of regime change. This was at odds, really, with President Trump, and so when he was picked, a lot of people who had been supportive of President Trump were- oh, my goodness, they're picking someone much more hawkish and much more eager to be involved and to intervene in other countries. And so people worried. And then the first year or so, people are like, oh, well, Rubio has done a good job on foreign aid, and they've cut back on all of the abuse of these NGOs around the world. And I think the people supporting the President have been very supportive of the Secretary of State. But I think once there's an invasion of Venezuela, or if they decide to re-up the subsidies and the gifts to Ukraine, I think you'll see a splintering and a fracturing of the movement that has supported the President, because I think a lot of people, including myself, were attracted to the president because of his reticence to get us involved in foreign war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, to date, they say nothing on or off the table, no specifics. We'll continue to track all the reporting on that. Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",

We've seen before a pattern of inciteful, dangerous rhetoric being used by the president and then people acting on that. You know, I lived through and experienced January 6, a very similar dynamic. He's been doing this for years, saying things and total disregard for the outcome, and what might happen when he throws this stuff out in the world.",

He was saying sedition was often, in the past, punishable by death. And then, before you appeared here today, on social media he put out, \"the traitors that told the military to disobey my orders, should be in jail right now, not roaming the fake news networks. I guess that's us trying to explain what they said was okay. It wasn't and never will be. It was sedition at the highest level. It's a major crime. There can be no other interpretation of what they said.\" That's a quote from what he put on social media. Do you have any idea what all these threats actually mean? Because he mentioned in an interview military courts and referenced the DOJ as well.",
      "REP. CROW: No, we don't know what this means. He doesn't know what this means because he's irresponsible. He's acting dangerous. He's acting in an inciteful way. There's two things going on here Margaret. One is the irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric by the President of the United States threatening to have members of Congress executed who he disagrees with. But it's also so telling that when members of Congress simply remind service members of the Constitution and their duty to obey the law, which is not just our right, but is our obligation to do, that he cannot handle that, and he resorts to threats of violence and threats of arrest and execution. That tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump's respect for the Constitution and the rule of law, and actually underscores our point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's get to the content of what you had in that video you released because there are also 15 House Republicans who are also veterans who released a video, including a retired three-star Marine Corps general, Jack Bergman. Take a listen to this.",
      "[ SOUND ON TAPE STARTS ]",
      "REP. JACK BERGMAN (R-MI) : Troops. Listen up. Any service member who refuses a lawful order is subject to court martial for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
      "REP. AUGUST PFLUGER (R-TX): We study what's lawful and what's not lawful, and the Democrats' stunt insinuating that there are illegal or unconstitutional orders. It's downright dangerous.",
      "REP. SCOTT PERRY (R-PA) : It is corrosive. It is meant to weaken our country and weaken the military.",
      "[ SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to these allegations from your colleagues, fellow veterans, that what you have put out there is weakening and corrosive to the military?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, these, unfortunately, are some of Trump's core supporters that are rallying behind the president, and they know better. They know exactly the difference between lawful versus unlawful. We were very clear in the video that what we're talking about is unlawful\u00a0 orders. You have the president's spokesperson going on into a press conference this past week and saying that we called for people to disobey lawful orders. They're simply lying because the truth is unacceptable to them. It's unacceptable. We wanted to start a conversation, and we did, about the dangerous rhetoric this president is using and the threats that he's made to use our military in an unlawful way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, what?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, send troops into Chicago, send troops into polling stations, kill terrorist families, arrest and execute, arrest and execute members of Congress--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --he hasn't done those things.",
      "REP. CROW: Shoot peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square, need I go on? He has a history of doing this, and if we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them. We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction which is exactly what we did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, so those were comments, not orders he gave, and social media posts and like, but- but I hear you that- that words matter. But the standard for troops, as I understand it, is that they should consult with the staff judge advocate, the staff legal counsel regarding orders, if they have legal questions. There is a process in place. Are you telling the rank and file troops to go outside of that practice?",
      "REP. CROW: No, absolutely not. Let me use an example of how this plays out and what this looks like downrange, as we say in the military--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah, because it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on those people down the chain.",
      "REP. CROW: I did three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. And before each of those combat deployments, I sat my soldiers down, my paratroopers and my Rangers, and we talked about the law of war. We lo- we talked about lawful versus unlawful orders, about the protection of civilians in conflict, right? Because you can't wait until a soldier is in the moment and has to make a split-second decision about what to do to train them, right? You have to talk about it. You have to train them before, which was why we put this video out, to get people thinking about their obligation. And all of the threats and all of the things the President have said would be manifestly unlawful and would be the types of orders that people shouldn't carry through because they would be murder if people actually did the things that Donald Trump threatened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we don't know yet that the deployment of troops on U.S. soil, if you were referring to the National Guard deployments in major U.S. cities, is actually unlawful. That's- that's tied up in the courts right now.",
      "REP. JASON CROW: Well, we're talking about the decision of troops on the ground, out in operations, right? Their interface with civilians, shooting civilians, going to polling stations, which is a violation of U.S. criminal law. Things that are ma--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- these things haven't happened, you are afraid they will.",
      "REP. JASON CROW: --things that are manifestly unlawful, that our troops might be put in the position to carry out, because that has what- that is what the president has repeatedly threatened to do. So again, it's very telling that simply restating their obligation to the Constitution and the law, which we do constantly with our service members gets this type of response from the president. You know, I am not going to be threatened and intimidated by the president of the United States. I have a job to do, and that is to ensure people follow the law. I took an oath to this country. It is a lifetime oath that I intend to carry out, and I am not going to be intimidated and threatened by the president and stop reminding people to follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I've talked to lawyers about this, and military lawyers about this, and there is some frustration that, you know, lawmakers haven't been in Washington doing their job in terms of oversight. There aren't hearings on Venezuela, there aren't hearings on those deployments of the National Guard, and yet there are public videos calling on troops at low ranks to make decisions unto themselves here about what is lawful or unlawful, or recall their training, or talk to their staff judge advocate about this. I mean this- why not first publicly call for a hearing before you call on them?",
      "REP. CROW: First of all, two separate issues. So on the hearing, absolutely right. We are pushing the Trump administration to actually give us briefings, give us hearings. Mike Johnson- Speaker Johnson, shut Congress down twice, twice, to avoid votes on releasing the Epstein files.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He would argue Democrats shut down Congress to- for the healthcare argument.--",
      "REP. CROW: It's very clear what they did. I still came to D.C. anyhow and pushed for oversight and pushed for briefings. So I've been in Congress for seven years almost, and I have never seen the lack of briefings and oversight and ability to access information. I have been completely shut out of the DOD and the CIA at this point as a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee. So this administration--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Isn't so much of this because the Republican leadership in Congress that isn't demanding those things.",
      "REP. CROW: Exactly, right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So-",
      "REP. CROW: Congress has the power to do this, so they're right. We need to be doing this. Democrats are trying to do it. We are being stonewalled and blocked by the Republicans, blocked by the- by the administration, because they actually don't want us to do the oversight, because they're afraid of what we're going to learn. And that is different, Margaret, than what we're talking about, you know, operational decisions, decisions to go to to, you know, war in the Caribbean, Venezuela, which are strictly within the purview of Congress. And Congress needs to be making those decisions and debating it, versus--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House says, oh it's not an act of war. It's, you know, foreign policy. And the president has a lot of leeway under the Constitution. That's their argument.",
      "REP. CROW: Well, we've been hearing this for 25 years, which is why Iraq and Afghanistan went on for as long as it did. We spent $3 trillion, lost 7000 service members' lives, and those ended poorly. Congress has to make that decision. Congress needs to be accountable for it, and Congress needs to be debating this before the American people, going to the American people and telling them why they should send their sons and daughters into conflict and they should spend hundreds of billions of dollars of their hard earned money. This president doesn't want that process to happen. And as somebody that did three combat tours in these wars, I've had enough of Congress being cut out of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you'll see in some of our upcoming polling data that the American public would like more information about the plans for Venezuela, which you were referencing there. Congressman Crow, thank you.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who joins us from Tucson, Arizona. Welcome back to Face The Nation, senator.",
      "SEN. KELLY: Thank you for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up where we left off on this topic of political violence. I know your family has suffered because of it, very, very directly. And then this past week, the president called that video. You participated in, \"sedition.\" You heard me read what he said again this morning, \"sedition at the highest level and a major crime.\" Have you- do you have credible threats? How concerned are you about your security at this point?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, Margaret, what the President said is very serious. I didn't think he would step over the, over that line calling for the execution of members of Congress, and his words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that. And because of what he says, there is now an increased threats against us. I'm not going to get into details on my personal security, but as the husband of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, we- I understand what political violence is. The president should as well. Just like Gabby, somebody tried to assassinate him, and he should understand that his words, have you know, could have serious, serious consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I remember just weeks ago, hearing from the president and other Republicans about the need to dial back the rhetoric after the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk. When it comes to your\u2013",
      "SEN. KELLY: Yeah, what happened to that? I mean, that was two months ago. Where are they now? We've heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the President has said about hanging members of Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I wanted to ask you. Why aren't we hearing from your Republican colleagues and in terms of your security, I understand there was a request for you to get a boost in Capitol Hill security support. Are Republican members on board with that?",
      "SEN. KELLY: I don't know. I've heard them say, you know very little about this. I think you know the President tries to intimidate them. He tries to intimidate Congress. He looks at government accountability as a nuisance. And I think it's really important for people to understand, Margaret, that the message he sent a couple days ago was, he declared that loyalty to the Constitution is now punishable by death. Those are serious words coming from the President of the United States. He's trying to intimidate us, but Margaret, I'm not going to be intimidated. You know, you just heard Jason Crow. He's not going to be intimidated either. We both served our country. We swore an oath. All we said is we reiterated what basically is the rule of law that members of the military should not, cannot follow illegal orders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point, in terms of lawful and unlawful orders, it gets complicated for rank-and-file to understand. I understand and other networks have reported that the senior judge advocate down at SOUTHCOM raised serious doubts about the legality of the strikes on those alleged drug votes, but was contradicted by lawyers at the executive branch. Have you spoken to the SOUTHCOM commander? Do you- are you hearing that there are unlawful orders being given?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, we're hearing the same thing that you are. The administration hasn't shared much information with us. I read the legal analysis. It was just like the briefs. They're tying themselves in knots trying to explain why what they're doing with regards to these drug boats is legal and it's, it's questionable at best. Our- one of our biggest allies, the United Kingdom, recently stopped sharing intelligence with us in the Caribbean because they question whether this is legal or not. We've been asking for more briefings from the right people. We have not received them, but the information that you just shared with me is the, is the public information. I don't have much more beyond that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the French government has said it's a violation of international law and the law of the sea. That's what our allies are saying about those strikes that are happening there. But, is that why\u2013",
      "SEN. KELLY: But, Margaret getting back to\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013you made this video?",
      "SEN. KELLY: No. The reason why we made this video is a couple things. This president, from before he was in office as he was a candidate, to the time he was in office in his first administration, has said things that cause us great concern. There is a trend here. When he was running for president, the first time he talked about he wanted the military, he said he would, he would- the military should be killing the families of terrorists. And when he was told that that was illegal, this was on a debate stage, he basically said that the military will not refuse to follow my orders, that they will carry out his orders regardless of what they were. Shooting protesters in the legs is something he brought up in his first administration and thankfully, Mark Esper, his Secretary of Defense, and Mark Milley, you know, basically told him, you cannot do that. If they weren't there, think of what possibly could have happened. So, we're concerned\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I need- yeah, I'm sorry. I just want to make sure I get to you on Ukraine, because there's so much happening, and I know you're such a big supporter of Ukraine. There are three prominent U.S. senators who have gone on the record now, including Republican Mike Rounds, who said yesterday, Secretary of State Rubio told them he was unaware of a threat to cut off U.S. support to Ukraine if they don't accept this proposed plan that's on the table. Here is how Senator Rounds described it.",
      "SEN. MIKE ROUNDS SOT: What he told us was that this was not the American proposal. This was a proposal which was received by someone who has identified and they believe to be representing Russia in this proposal. It was given to Mr. Witkoff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So since those remarks were made and backed up by multiple senators, I've received phone calls from Senior White House officials from, from senior U.S. officials saying, no, no, no, that's not at all what, what Secretary Rubio said. What version of events do we believe here in terms of what America is putting forward?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Margaret, they've got to clear this up. You have Rubio talking to my Senate colleague, saying one thing. The spokesperson for the State Department saying another. Your conversations with the White House contradict what the Secretary of State and, by the way, the National Security Adviser, same guy, has said about this. They've got, they've got to figure this out and get the message out and explain to the American people what's going on. I will say this, that, that, that plan, that's Putin's plan. That is a very good deal for Russia. It is a horrible deal for Ukraine, for our allies and even for our own national security. If Putin gets the chance with that deal to, you know, rearm, rebuild his economy and gain territory, by the way, that's what he wanted. Then the Baltics, Poland, Romania, all those other countries down the line are at threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. keeps emphasizing it is a working document, so it may be in a different state than what was leaked by an anti-Zelensky politician, but Ukraine's Ambassador did tell us there's a separate security guarantee document. What, what needs to be in there that would actually protect Ukraine? Does that need to go for a vote before the U.S. Congress?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, it depends on what it is, but Congress should be involved. If there is a treaty with Ukraine on their own security, it's something that we would want to have some say in. And ultimately we would vote on in the United States Senate we would send to the president, but they need to be talking to us about this, on both sides of the aisle. Often the path they're going on recently is to just share information with the Republicans and even my Republican colleagues don't seem to like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "SEN. KELLY: But, that's what this White House is, is doing, and it's because they don't want congressional oversight in, in any way, whether it's on Ukraine, Venezuela, or any, any issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we got to leave it there, senator, but to your point, a number of very fiery statements from Republican senators in the past few hours. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "Fifty of the 303 schoolchildren abducted from a Catholic school in north-central Nigeria's Niger state have escaped captivity and are now with their families, the school authority said Sunday, bringing relief to some distraught families after one of the largest school abductions in Nigeria's history.",
      "The schoolchildren, aged between 10 and 18, escaped individually between Friday and Saturday, according to the Most Rev. Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Niger state and the proprietor of the school. A total of 253 schoolchildren and 12 teachers are still held by the kidnappers, he said in a statement.",
      "\"We were able to ascertain this when we decided to contact and visit some parents,\" Yohanna said.",
      "The pupils and students were seized together with their teachers by gunmen who attacked the St. Mary's School, a Catholic institution in Niger state's remote Papiri community, on Friday. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the abductions and authorities have said tactical squads have been deployed alongside local hunters to rescue the children.",
      "It was not immediately clear where the Niger state children were being held or how they managed to return home. Nigeria's military and police did not immediately respond to an Associated Press inquiry.",
      "\"As much as we receive the return of these 50 children that escaped with some sigh of relief, I urge you all to continue in your prayers for the rescue and safe return of the remaining victims,\" Yohanna said.",
      "Pope Leo XIV called for the immediate release of the schoolchildren and staff of the school, saying at the end of a mass in St. Peter's Square on Sunday that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident.",
      "\"I feel great sorrow, especially for the many girls and boys who have been abducted and for their anguished families,\" the pontiff said. \"I make a heartfelt appeal for the immediate release of the hostages and urge the competent authorities to take appropriate and timely decisions to ensure their release.\"",
      "All schools in Niger state were ordered to close on Saturday in response to the kidnappings,\u00a0reported BBC, a CBS partner. Dominic Adamu, whose daughters are students at St. Mary's School but were not abducted, told the outlet that the attack \"took everybody by surprise.\"",
      "\"Everybody is weak,\" Adamu said, according to the BBC.",
      "Another woman, who was not identified by name, told the outlet that her 6- and 13-year-old nieces had been kidnapped from the school, adding: \"I just want them to go home.\"",
      "The Niger state attack happened four days after 25 schoolchildren were seized in similar circumstances in neighboring Kebbi state's Maga town, which is 106 miles away.",
      "Both states are in a northern region of Nigeria where dozens of armed gangs have used kidnapping for ransom as one way of dominating remote communities with little government and security presence.",
      "Satellite image shows that the Niger state school compound is attached to an adjoining primary school, with more than 50 classrooms and dormitory buildings. It's located near a major road linking the towns of Yelwa and Mokwa.",
      "School kidnappings have come to define insecurity in Africa's most populous nation, and armed gangs often see schools as \"strategic\" targets to draw more attention.",
      "Niger state hurriedly closed down all schools after Friday's attack, while some federal colleges in conflict hotspots across the region were also closed by the Nigerian government.",
      "\"I will not relent\"",
      "The kidnappings are happening against the backdrop of President Trump's claims of \"Christian persecution\" in the West African country. Attacks in Nigeria affect both Christians and Muslims. The school attack earlier this week in Kebbi state was in a Muslim-majority town.",
      "Arrests are rare and ransom payments are common in many of the hot spots in northern Nigeria.",
      "Confidence McHarry, a security analyst at Lagos-based consultancy SBM Intelligence, said that while there's little evidence that Trump's comments might have inspired the gunmen to launch more attacks in the hope that more attention would bring higher ransoms, \"the absence of consequences is what is fuelling these attacks.\"",
      "In a statement welcoming the freedom of some of those kidnapped in Niger state and Kebbi state, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu said his government will not relent until every hostage is freed.",
      "\"Let me be clear: I will not relent. Every Nigerian, in every state, has the right to safety \u2014 and under my watch, we will secure this nation and protect our people,\" he added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-alleged-hybrid-warfare-undersea-cables/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A web of undersea cables connects our lives and our global economy. As U.S. adversaries are accused of sabotage, they're proving to be targets of choice.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Over 95% percent of the world's internet traffic and voice and communication data flows through a vast network of fiber optic cables laid across the floors of oceans and seas. The cables are faster, more reliable and cheaper data carriers than alternatives such as satellites, and they have become indispensable to modern life.",
      "They are the veins and arteries that link our deeply interconnected world, transmitting data for everything from sensitive government and military information and text messages between friends, to trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day, underpinning the global economy.",
      "But our reliance on these undersea cables is a vulnerability, and one that rogue actors have allegedly already tried to exploit, including some adversaries of the United States.",
      "Russia has been accused recently by America's NATO allies of increasing \"hybrid warfare\" against Europe, and analysts say it has shown a clear interest in targeting things like undersea infrastructure.",
      "\"That's quite explicitly a part of Russian thinking regarding modern warfare,\" said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, in an interview with CBS News earlier this year.",
      "He said that sabotaging \"critical nodes on which society functions\u2026 [has been] illustrated in real time in the last few years.\"",
      "Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has regularly conducted military strikes against Ukrainian energy and transport facilities. But beyond the battlefield, Russia has also been accused of targeting the infrastructure \u2014 including undersea cables \u2014 that's vital to other countries, including many of the United States' NATO allies.",
      "\"The sabotage events, they are a new phenomenon,\" Gabrielius Landsbergis, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, told CBS News. \"They are directly associated with this later stage of Russia's militarization and aggressive action \u2014 not just against Ukraine, but also against the West.\"",
      "Russia has denied allegations of interfering with undersea cables and called accusations it has carried out acts of sabotage in Europe \"Russophobia.\"",
      "What is happening in the Baltic Sea?",
      "The Baltic Sea is a nearly enclosed body of water surrounded by eight NATO countries and Russia.",
      "Relatively few undersea cables connect some of the Baltic NATO members, such as Lithuania, to the rest of Europe and the wider world.",
      "\"Baltic states are, you know, not entirely an island, but pretty much so,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"That means that for us [Baltic states] to connect to the Western infrastructure, it's a rather difficult task. So most of our connections, a big part of our connections, go through the Baltic Sea.\"",
      "The Baltic Sea is relatively shallow, meaning ships only need to drag their anchors along the bottom to cause potentially serious damage to cables. That increases the possibility of accidental damage, but also lends plausible deniability to malign actors who would like to carry out sabotage operations there.",
      "And Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of vessels, with hazy registration and insurance documentation that allows it to continue transporting oil and other energy products around the world despite Western sanctions imposed over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has increased its plausible deniability.",
      "When Finland and Sweden joined NATO, many in the West hoped the Baltic Sea would effectively become a \"NATO lake.\" Over the last few years, there have been several incidents of alleged Russian sabotage of underwater cables in the sea.",
      "\"It is clearly a spike,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"We have never seen almost any incidents during the last, I don't know, 20 years, and suddenly after [Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine] started, they're basically recurring every month.\"",
      "Targeting the \"anthropogenic shell of modern society\"",
      "RUSI's Kaushal said the apparent sabotage operations in the Baltic are an example of the hybrid warfare tactics being increasingly adopted by U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"Ever since the 90's and early 2000's, the Russians have talked about how the so-called anthropogenic shell of modern society \u2014 basically the fragile infrastructure on which it depends \u2014 is its Achilles heel,\" he told CBS News earlier this year. \"Attacks on undersea cables are one major part of that, along with missile attacks (like on infrastructure in Ukraine) and cyberattacks.\"",
      "Landsbergis told CBS News that he believes Russia's objective in disrupting undersea cables is to intimidate local populations, as well as to \"test the reactions \u2014 you know, how do politicians react? How do militaries react? Whether there is a response or not.\"",
      "With the Trump administration pushing hard for its European NATO allies to rely less on the U.S. for their security, \"it's not the question about how we see NATO, but it's the question how Putin sees NATO,\" Landsbergis told CBS News.",
      "He said without a firm, unified response to the sabotage, Putin could determine \"NATO is not the alliance that it has been before Trump,\" and that could lead the Russian autocrat to \"say, OK, maybe this is the time that I intend to test it.\"",
      "What is NATO doing about it?",
      "At the start of this year, NATO launched \"Baltic Sentry,\" a new operation \"to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure.\"",
      "\"By working together with all Allies, we will do what it takes to ensure the safety and security not only of our critical infrastructure but of all that we hold dear,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a statement announcing Baltic Sentry in January.",
      "The operation involves maritime patrols, aircraft and naval drones, as well as national surveillance assets, according to NATO. The Alliance said it would also work with industry to improve the resilience of undersea cables.",
      "Sweden, another country that shares a Baltic coastline with Russia, broke with its centuries-old policy of military non-alignment and became NATO's newest member last year, in direct response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It staged military exercises earlier this month to practice countering covert espionage and sabotage missions carried out by adversaries in the Baltic Sea.",
      "\"We're not at peace, but not at war,\" Swedish submarine flotilla Commander Paula Wallenburg told CBS News during the exercise.",
      "Wallenburg said the current circumstances look \"pretty close to\" those seen during the Cold War, when the nuclear-armed U.S. and then-Soviet Union tested each other's resolve in a face off that never quite turned into a full-scale military conflict.",
      "\"It's a very serious situation when it comes to security here in this area,\" she said.",
      "Below is a look at some recent incidents in the Baltic Sea in which Russia-linked vessels have been alleged to have been involved in damaging, or seen loitering around, undersea cables.",
      "Case study: Eagle S",
      "On Christmas Day 2024, an electricity cable and four telecommunications cables linking Finland and Estonia suffered unplanned outages, reducing the two countries' interconnectivity. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation later discovered a 60-mile drag mark near the Estlink 2 cable.",
      "The Eagle S, a crude oil tanker sailing under the flag of the Cook Islands and officially registered to a UAE company, left Russia's Baltic port of Ust-Luga on the morning of the outages, with its destination listed as Turkey, according to ship tracking data from MarineTraffic.",
      "The ship sailed over one of the Estlink submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland around the time a power failure was reported by the country's electric grid operators.",
      "The ship's anchor was later discovered near the point where the drag mark ended.",
      "Finnish border guards detained the ship and its crew, led by a Georgian national.",
      "The Eagle S was released to international waters in March, but Finland pursued criminal charges against the crew. The case was dismissed in October, when the court ruled prosecutors had failed to prove intent, but prosecutors said they would appeal.",
      "Case study: Two Russian trawlers tracked in area when Svalbard cable cut",
      "In February 2022, Norwegian police told local media they believed \"human impact\" was to blame for damage to one of a pair of undersea telecommunications cables connecting the country's mainland with its northern archipelago of Svalbard a month earlier.",
      "Space Norway, which operates the Svalbard Undersea Cable System, told CBS News the two cables \u2014 which were laid as a redundant pair in the event one suffered damage \u2014 are the world's northernmost subsea cable systems.",
      "Space Norway said it detected an outage in the Greenland Sea on Jan, 7.",
      "The damage occurred in an area where the cables descend steeply from a depth of 980 feet to nearly 9,000 feet, the operator told CBS News.",
      "Generally, the cables are buried approximately six feet deep, although there may be variations due to the nature of the seabed, the state-owned company explained, while declining to go into detail about the seabed conditions where the damaged cables were buried.",
      "There was never a loss of service for users in Svalbard, a Space Norway spokesperson said, and the investigation into the cut was eventually closed due to a lack of evidence.",
      "But a report from Norway's public broadcaster NRK and open-source information showed Russian fishing trawlers made more than a dozen passes over the area before the damage occurred.",
      "Other evidence of \"hybrid warfare\"",
      "This week, Poland's top diplomat accused Russia of carrying out an \"act of state terror\" by blowing up a railway line over the weekend.",
      "\"It was an act of not only subversion, as happened before, but an act of state terror as its clear intention was to cause human casualties,\" Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski said.",
      "Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said two Ukrainian citizens believed to have been working with Russia's secret services were suspected of carrying out the attack, which he called an \"unprecedented act of sabotage.\"",
      "The explosion took place on a rail line linking the Polish capital, Warsaw, to Ukraine, and Polish officials said it was used to transport aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia dismissed allegations that it was involved in the explosion, calling them \"Russophobia.\"",
      "\"The latest sabotage in Poland that could have become a mass casualty event brings even more heightened dimension to the debate,\" Landsbergis told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"Imagine if there would be 100 casualties \u2014 would we be still talking about hybrid? Or we would drop the hybrid and just call it war and ask for Article 5?\" Landsbergis said, referring to the mutual-defense agreement among NATO members. \"The question points to a fact that Russians are pushing the escalation lines even further, forcing us to ask ourselves: Aren't we at war already?\"",
      "The incident came amid a spate of airspace violations, including some near airports and military bases, in Western European nations, usually involving unidentified drones, but also, in at least two instances, Russian warplanes.",

The uptick in the AE stock price speaks for itself,\" Eldridge explained. \"A 10% increase \u2014 which was almost entirely attributable to one, standalone, campaign \u2013 is incredible.

      "America\u2019s ranchers are facing their smallest cattle herd in 70 years.",
      "Years of punishing drought, rising costs and an aging ranching workforce have thinned herds across the country. Ranchers and agricultural economists alike say rebuilding will take years and beef prices aren\u2019t likely to ease anytime soon.",
      "\"The biggest thing has been drought,\" said Eric Belasco, head of the agricultural economics department at Montana State University.",
      "BEEF PRICES ARE CLOSE TO RECORD HIGHS \u2014 BUT AMERICANS AREN\u2019T CUTTING BACK",
      "He said years of dry weather have wiped out grasslands across the West and Plains, leaving ranchers without enough feed or water to sustain their herds. Many have been forced to sell cattle early, even the cows needed to produce the next generation of calves, making it hard to rebuild.",
      "\"It\u2019s not going to be a quick fix, you\u2019re not going to solve it overnight,\" Belasco told Fox News Digital.",
      "Ranchers have sold off many of their cattle in order to cope with rising prices. (Melissa Phillip/Houston Chronicle/Getty Images)",
      "Belasco said the aftereffects of years of drought are still being felt and until ranchers can rebuild their herds, consumers will keep paying the price.",
      "\"The primary reason you see prices so high is because we haven\u2019t seen any kind of inventory rebuilding,\" he said. \"Until you see that rebuild, you probably won\u2019t see prices coming back down again.\"",
      "That slow rebuilding is a challenge for the cattle industry, according to Derrell Peel, a professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is there\u2019s really nothing anybody can do to change this very quickly,\" Peel said. \"We\u2019re in a tight supply situation that took several years to develop, and it\u2019ll take several years to get out of it.\"",
      "Peel, who specializes in livestock marketing, said there\u2019s no quick way to ease pressure on beef prices, since it takes roughly two years to bring animals to market and several years to rebuild herds.",

      "Research from the Kansas City Federal Reserve found that with each step up in drought severity, cattle-producing regions see about a 12% drop in hay production, a 5% rise in hay prices, a 1% reduction in herd size and a 4% decrease in farm income.",
      "To cope, many ranchers are shrinking their herds. A 2022 Farm Bureau survey found that about two in three ranchers have sold animals off, leaving them with roughly one-third fewer cattle than before.",

      "\"I think it's going to take a while to fix this crisis that we're in with the cattle shortage. My message to consumers is simple, folks, be patient. We've got to build back our herds,\" Bolton told Fox News Digital.",
      "Bolton said the region, known for its red dirt and family-run ranches, has gone nearly three months without rain. While showers were finally arriving, he noted that the cattle industry has weathered one setback after another, from market turmoil to extreme conditions, over the past five years.",
      "The growing strain highlights how persistent drought is reshaping the ranching industry and tightening the nation\u2019s livestock supply.",
      "That pressure is being felt not just on ranches but also at the grocery store.",
      "According to USDA data, the average retail price of beef rose from about $8.51 a pound in August 2024 to $9.85 a pound a year later, a gain of roughly 16%.",
      "The \"5-market steer price\" represents what ranchers earn for live cattle before they\u2019re processed into meat. The \"farm-to-retail\" spread reflects everything that happens after that \u2013 the costs and profits tied to slaughtering, processing, packaging, shipping and selling beef in stores.",
      "Much of that work \u2014 and the profits it generates \u2014 are concentrated among the industry\u2019s \"big four\" meatpackers: Tyson Foods, JBS, Cargill and National Beef.",
      "Together, these data points show that while ranchers are earning slightly more for their cattle than they were a few years ago, the biggest price increases are happening well after the animals leave the pasture.",
      "Despite the markups between the ranch and the grocery store, demand hasn\u2019t wavered. Americans are still buying beef more than ever.",

      "The current breakdown in the House is 219-213 in favor of Republicans with three vacancies: Former Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., retired. The late Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Texas, died. Former Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., resigned late last week after voters elected her governor of New Jersey. The House finally swore in Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., six weeks after she prevailed in her special election in September to succeed her late father. Late Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, D-Ariz., died earlier this year.",

      "But the math in the coming weeks and months quickly gets dicey for the GOP.",
      "Greene does not step aside until Jan. 5. So let\u2019s run through the numbers and permutations which could evolve over the next few months.",
      "There\u2019s a special election in Tennessee to succeed former House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green on Dec. 2. President Donald Trump carried the district by 22 points last fall. Green bested his opponent \u2013 former Nashville Mayor Megan Barry, a Democrat, by 21 points. So Republicans are expected to hold this seat.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images; Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)",
      "But there is something important to know about special elections: they\u2019re special. They sometimes produce weird results because the usual voting electorate doesn\u2019t show up. Plus, surges by one party or the other in a special election held in either a deeply blue or ruby red district sometimes signals a boost for the party. Strong performances or even upsets sometimes portend what\u2019s ahead in the next election. They also signal a referendum on the President.",
      "For instance, in 2017, Democrats were competitive in four GOP seats of House members who departed to join the Trump administration. But even though the Democrats ran well, they still failed to flip any of those seats. Former Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., stepped down to become CIA Director. Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan., then won that seat by a mere six points. Current Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., resigned to become Interior Secretary. Former Rep. and current Gov. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., won \u2013 but only by five points and less than 50 percent of the vote. Former Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., resigned to become Health and Human Services Secretary. Former Rep. Karen Handel, R-Ga., won by only three points over current Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga. Former Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., left his House seat to become Budget Director and later White House Chief of Staff. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., succeeded Mulvaney.

      "Even though Democrats failed to flip any of those seats, they made the GOP sweat and put up strong showings. Some analysts viewed the Democrats\u2019 performances in those contests as a sign of things to come in the 2018 midterms and President Trump\u2019s weakness.",

      "If they do, the GOP majority dwindles to 219-214. But if Van Epps prevails, the GOP gets some space with a 220-213 majority.",
      "But that only lasts until Greene steps down in January. So the majority would dwindle to 219-213.",
      "Remember that you cannot appoint someone to the House. So you have to wait for special elections. The Georgia special election to succeed Greene wouldn\u2019t happen until March.",
      "But there\u2019s lots to happen before then.",
      "There is a special election runoff to replace Democrat Sylvester Turner on Jan. 31. Democrats will hold that seat with two of their own in the runoff. But government funding expires on Jan. 30. One wonders if House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., might hold off swearing-in a prospective Democratic successor to Turner if the House is out for similar reasons as to why the Speaker refrained from swearing-in Adelita Grijalva.",

      "So, presuming Van Epps wins, and with Greene gone and either Democrats Amanda Edwards or Christian Menefee winning the Turner seat in Texas, the GOP majority dips to 219-214. It\u2019s a margin of five. But again, Republicans can only lose two votes and not need help from the other side.",
      "Now we\u2019re back to a special election in March for Greene\u2019s seat. Again, Democrats will try to make that competitive. But for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say the GOP wins. The Republican majority climbs to 220-214.",
      "So at this stage, we are down to only one vacancy in the House \u2013 presuming no one else quits or, God forbid, dies. The special election to succeed Sherrill will come in April. Again, Democrats should hold that seat. But special elections are just that: special. Republicans will certainly try to flip that seat. But if Democrats hold on and the House is at full strength, the GOP majority will sit at 220-215.",

      "\"The Middle East has oil; China has rare earths,\" former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping declared in 1987. Just as Arab nations turned oil wealth into global power, Beijing recognized the leverage it could gain by dominating the materials modern industry would only grow more dependent on.",
      "Four decades later, that foresight has paid off. China now controls roughly 70 percent of global rare-earth mining and nearly 90 percent of refining \u2014 the most strategic and profitable step in the chain.",
      "The U.S. didn\u2019t just lose ground in mining \u2014 it handed Beijing the technology that made rare earths valuable in the first place.",
      "In the early 1990s, a General Motors subsidiary called Magnaquench was producing 85 percent of the magnets used in precision-guided missiles and other defense systems. When GM sold the company in 1995 to a consortium that included two Chinese entities, the consequences were immediate. Within a year, the entire product line had been replicated in China, and the U.S. had lost its magnet-making process almost overnight.",
      "Abigail Hunter, executive director of the Ambassador Alfred Hoffman Jr. Center for Critical Mineral Strategy at SAFE, said the sale represented more than a bad deal \u2014 it was a strategic surrender. \"We were focused on the internet and globalization, not on where our materials were coming from,\" she said. \"Policy became episodic rather than strategic.\"",
      "While Washington debated environmental rules and trade policy, China moved aggressively. \"The United States had Mountain Pass and a few other capabilities tied to companies like GM,\" said Wade Senti, president of Advanced Magnet Lab. \"But our total capacity was under 2,000 metric tons a year. Meanwhile, China poured money into innovation, refining and manufacturing at a scale that far exceeded what we ever had.\"",
      "By the early 2000s, the U.S. mining and refining base had collapsed. The technology migrated east along with the supply chain. Beijing not only mined the minerals but mastered the high-value steps that turned them into finished magnets \u2014 the core of everything from fighter jets to electric vehicles.",
      "The ore pulled from its depths, pictured above, yielded neodymium, lanthanum and cerium \u2014 metals that powered radar systems, early computer chips and the guidance of precision munitions.\u00a0 (Steve Marcus/Reuters)",
      "\"Between market forces and environmental restrictions \u2026 it's certainly led to a constraint with extracting resources,\" Senti said.",
      "Rare-earth elements now underpin nearly every modern weapons system. \"They steer missiles, power radar and drive the night-vision goggles Marines wear in the field,\" Hunter said. \"If it moves, sees or communicates in today\u2019s military, there\u2019s probably a rare-earth element in it.\"",
      "Washington\u2019s complacency cracked this spring when Beijing briefly restricted exports of rare-earth products \u2014 a warning shot that rippled through supply chains from Detroit to the Pentagon.",
      "\"When China required export licenses, some U.S. factory lines literally stopped,\" Hunter said. \"The administration scrambled to negotiate with Beijing and simultaneously rolled out emergency support for MP Materials, the operator of Mountain Pass.\"",
      "That deal marked a turning point: for the first time, the federal government backed an entire supply chain \u2014 from mine to magnet \u2014 using every tool at its disposal. Grants, loans, price supports and guaranteed purchases were deployed to jump-start domestic production.",
      "CHINA'S TRADE WAR WEAPONS: RARE EARTH BAN AND US DEBT DUMP COULD CRIPPLE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND DEFENSE",
      "MP Materials, which resumed mining at Mountain Pass in 2018 and ramped up refining to record levels before the Pentagon deal, is now expanding its magnet manufacturing facility in Texas. Another U.S. manufacturer in South Carolina has also begun producing magnets. But rebuilding the ecosystem will take time. \"It\u2019s a ten-year project, not something we can do in a year,\" Hunter said. \"We\u2019re starting to see progress, but we\u2019re nowhere near self-sufficiency.\"",
      "The Trump administration has put the U.S. on a wartime footing for decoupling with China, taking a 15 percent stake in MP Materials in an unprecedented arrangement and pushing a wave of international critical-minerals agreements meant to cut Beijing out of key supply chains.",
      "Over the past year, Washington has signed multi-billion dollar partnerships across five continents \u2014 including a $10 billion package of new projects announced this fall. A landmark framework with Australia commits both nations to co-invest roughly $1 billion each in rare-earth and battery-metal ventures, while parallel agreements with Japan and South Korea focus on securing non-Chinese refining and magnet production.",
      "China now controls roughly 70 percent of global rare-earth mining and nearly 90 percent of refining \u2014 the most strategic and profitable step in the chain. (Stringer/Reuters)",
      "The administration has also turned to Africa, signing deals with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to trace and develop mineral supply routes, and to Ukraine, where a 2025 reconstruction fund gives U.S. companies preferred access to future mining projects. Together, the web of pacts marks the most aggressive U.S. mineral diplomacy since the Cold War \u2014 a global race to control the elements that power modern weapons, vehicles and technology.",
      "Yet even as the U.S. forges alliances abroad, officials warn that true security will hinge on what happens at home. Under a 2027 mandate, the Pentagon must build a fully domestic rare-earth supply chain for defense production \u2014 from mine to magnet \u2014 that avoids Chinese inputs entirely. Meeting that goal will require more than foreign partnerships: it means breaking through America\u2019s own permitting gridlock, financing new refineries and rebuilding a skilled workforce that vanished when the industry collapsed two decades ago.",
      "\"The international deals may buy time,\" Senti said, \"but they\u2019re no substitute for restoring the industrial base that once made us the world\u2019s undisputed source of strategic minerals.\"",
      "Both Hunter and Senti see the next few years as decisive. The same materials that once powered America\u2019s Cold War innovation now underpin China\u2019s economic and military strength.",
      "\"We have to reform permitting so we can actually build mines and refineries here,\" Hunter said. \"We can\u2019t keep pretending it\u2019s someone else\u2019s problem while importing everything.\"",

      "For Senti, the mission is more direct. \"There\u2019s a lot of work to do,\" he said. \"Companies like ours are boots on the ground trying to unlock the bottlenecks.\"",
      "In the Mojave Desert, the trucks at Mountain Pass are running again \u2014 small symbols of a nation trying to reclaim what it lost. But as China continues to tighten its grip on the minerals that drive the modern world, America\u2019s comeback in the resource race is only just beginning."

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Google is sounding the alarm for Android users after uncovering a wave of fake VPN apps that sneak malware onto phones and tablets. These dangerous apps pose as privacy tools but hide info stealers, banking trojans and remote access malware designed to loot personal data.",
      "More people are relying on VPNs to protect their privacy, secure home networks and shield personal information while using public Wi-Fi. Attackers know this demand is growing. They use it to lure users into downloading convincing VPN lookalikes that contain hidden malware.",

      "Fake VPN apps are spreading across Android devices by posing as trusted privacy tools. (iStock)",
      "How fake VPN apps lure users",
      "Cybercriminals create malicious VPN apps that impersonate trusted brands. They use sexually suggestive ads, geopolitical headlines or fake privacy claims to push people into quick downloads. Google says many of these campaigns run across app stores and shady websites.",
      "DELETE THE FAKE VPN APP STEALING ANDROID USERS' MONEY",
      "Once installed, these apps inject malware that steals passwords, messages and financial details. Attackers can hijack accounts, drain bank balances or lock devices with ransomware. Some campaigns even use professional ad creatives and influencer-style promotions to appear legitimate.",
      "Scammers now use AI tools to design ads, phishing pages and fake brands with alarming speed. This gives them the power to reach large groups of victims with very little effort.",
      "Why malicious VPN apps are spreading",
      "Fake VPN apps remain one of the most effective tools for attackers. These apps request sensitive permissions and often run silently in the background. Once active, they can collect browsing data, cryptocurrency wallet details or private messages.",
      "According to Google, the most dangerous apps pretend to be known enterprise VPNs or premium privacy tools. Many promote themselves through adult ads, push notifications and cloned social media accounts.",
      "How to recognize a genuine VPN app",
      "Google recommends installing VPN services only from trusted sources. In Google Play, legitimate VPNs include a verified VPN badge to show that the app passed an authenticity check.",
      "A real VPN will never ask for access to your contacts, photos or private messages. It will not ask you to sideload updates or follow outside links for installation.",
      "Be careful with free VPN claims. Many free privacy tools rely on excessive data collection or hide malware inside downloadable files.",
      "Ways to stay safe from fake VPN apps",
      "Staying ahead of these fake VPN scams starts with a few smart habits that make your device much harder for attackers to target.",
      "Stick to the Google Play Store. Avoid links from ads, pop-ups or messages that try to rush you. Many fake VPN campaigns depend on off-platform downloads because they cannot pass the Play Store security checks.",
      "Google now includes a special VPN badge that verifies an app has passed an authenticity review. This badge confirms that the developer followed strict guidelines and that the app went through additional screening.",
      "If you want a reliable VPN that has already been vetted for security and performance, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Malicious VPN apps often target information already floating around the web, including your email, phone number and personal details exposed through data brokers. A trusted data removal service can help pull your information from people-search sites and broker databases, which reduces the amount of data scammers can use against you. This limits the damage if a fake VPN app steals your info or if attackers try to match stolen data with public records to build convincing scams.",
      "CAN YOU BE TRACKED WHEN USING A VPN?",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Google Play Protect, which is built-in malware protection for Android devices, automatically removes known malware. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all emerging malware from Android devices.",
      "Settings may vary depending on your Android phone\u2019s manufacturer",

      "While Google Play Protect offers a helpful first layer of defense, it is not a full antivirus. A strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection. It can block malicious downloads, detect hidden malware and warn you when an app acts in unusual ways. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "A genuine VPN only needs network-related permissions. If a VPN asks for access to photos, contacts or messages, treat it as a major warning sign. Restrict permissions when possible.",
      "Sideloaded apps bypass Google's security filters. Attackers often hide malware inside APK files or update prompts that promise extra features. If you're unfamiliar with the term, sideloading means installing apps outside the Google Play Store, usually by downloading a file from a website, email or message. These apps never go through Google's safety checks, which makes them far riskier to install.",
      "Fake VPN ads often claim your device is already infected or that your connection is not secure. Real privacy apps do not use panic-based marketing.",
      "Look up the developer's website and reviews. A legitimate VPN provider will have a clear privacy policy, customer support and a consistent history of app updates.",
      "Free VPNs often rely on risky data practices or hide malware. If a service promises premium features at no cost, question how it pays its bills.",
      "DO YOU NEED A VPN AT HOME? HERE ARE 10 REASONS YOU DO",
      "If someone contacts you claiming they can recover stolen money, cut contact. Real agencies never demand upfront fees and never request remote access to your device.",
      "Install security patches as soon as they appear. Updates protect your phone from malware strains that rely on old software vulnerabilities.",
      "Scammers now use AI-generated ads and fake brands to trick you into quick downloads. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake VPN apps are becoming a major threat to Android users as scammers exploit the rising demand for privacy tools and home network security. Attackers hide behind familiar logos, aggressive ads and AI-powered campaigns to push apps that steal data the moment you install them. Staying safe requires careful downloading habits, attention to permissions and a healthy amount of skepticism toward anything that claims instant privacy or premium features for free.",

      "Could the Klein Vision AirCar redefine the future of travel? Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses.",
      "Archer Aviation, a leading developer of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, just made one of its boldest moves yet. The company agreed to acquire Hawthorne Airport for $126 million in cash.",
      "According to Archer's latest shareholder letter, the deal includes the remaining 30 years on the airport's master lease and an exclusive option to take a controlling stake in the on-site fixed-base operator, subject to city approval.",
      "This historic 80-acre site includes about 190,000 square feet of terminals, office space and hangars. Its location near LAX and major Los Angeles destinations makes it a prime spot for an air taxi network that aims to change how people move in crowded cities.",

      "PENNSYLVANIA BILL SEEKS TO LEGALIZE FLYING CARS",
      "A rendering of Archer\u2019s development plans for Hawthorne Airport in Los Angeles. (Archer Aviation)",
      "Why Hawthorne Airport matters for the new air taxi network",
      "Archer Aviation plans to use the airport as the main operational hub for its LA air taxi network. The company also plans to prepare the site to support transportation during the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This includes managing everything from takeoff scheduling to ground operations. In its shareholder letter, Archer frames Hawthorne as a \"plug-and-play\" anchor hub for its LA28 Olympic plans, saying it expects to ramp up aircraft testing, storage, maintenance and charging on-site as it prepares for commercial service.",
      "The airport will also become a test bed for next-generation AI-powered aviation systems. These tools will help Archer develop smarter air traffic management, faster turnaround times and safer operations in crowded airspace.",
      "Archer outlines a two-phase plan in the letter. Phase 1 focuses on redeveloping up to 200,000 square feet of hangars and locking in control of the FBO, while Phase 2 layers in AI air traffic and ground management, smart sensor-embedded runways and a more digital, streamlined passenger experience.",
      "United Airlines CFO Michael Leskinen praised the move and said,\u00a0\"Archer's trajectory validates our conviction that eVTOLs are part of the next generation of air traffic technology that will fundamentally reshape aviation. Their vision for an AI-enabled operations platform isn't just about eVTOLs, it's also about leveraging cutting-edge technology to better enable moving people safely and efficiently in our most congested airspaces. Through United's investment arm, United Airlines Ventures, we're investing in companies like Archer that pioneer technologies that will define and support aviation infrastructure for decades to come.\"",

      "Archer plans to turn Hawthorne Airport into the main hub for its LA air taxi network. (Archer Aviation)",
      "Neighbors outraged over \u2018AI air taxi\u2019 takeover",
      "Not everyone is cheering Archer's plan to turn Hawthorne into a flagship hub for AI-guided flying taxis. A local group called Hawthorne Quiet Skies, made up of residents living around the airport, says it was blindsided by the $126 million takeover and that no one from the company or city bothered to engage it before announcing a \"test bed for AI-powered aviation technologies\" over homes.",
      "Neighbors who live just across the street and within a couple of blocks of the runway describe Hawthorne as one of the most tightly packed airports in the country, with homes on three sides and years of complaints about deafening jet and helicopter noise. The city's own 2021 noise study identified more than 160 homes and roughly 480 people already exposed to unhealthy noise levels, yet residents say there has been \"zero progress\" on mitigation even as the airport shifted from small private planes to commercial traffic and now an around-the-clock eVTOL hub.",
      "The group is also raising alarms about Archer's AI ambitions, pointing to academic research that current machine-learning systems in aviation still struggle to handle unusual conditions and lack formal safety guarantees.",
      "They argue that whatever the promises of cleaner, futuristic air taxis, Hawthorne is being used as a live test site without clear safeguards, updated federal noise rules or any serious plan to compensate families if nonstop eVTOL traffic makes their homes too loud to live in.",
      "CHINA\u2019S FIRST MASS-PRODUCED FLYING CAR DEBUTS",
      "How Archer Aviation is funding growth and expanding its air taxi program",
      "Alongside the airport news, Archer reported major financial momentum. The company raised an additional $650 million in equity, which boosted its total liquidity to more than $2 billion. The company's Midnight aircraft also hit new flight milestones, including a 55-mile flight at over 126 mph and a climb to 10,000 feet.",
      "Archer also expanded its global technology footprint. It completed the acquisition of Lilium's patent portfolio, which pushes Archer's total intellectual property to more than 1,000 global assets. Those patents cover ducted fans, high voltage systems, flight controls and other key technologies.",
      "International expansion is underway, too. Archer began test and demo flights in the UAE and secured new partnerships with Korean Air and with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo's JV in Osaka and Tokyo.",
      "The airport will serve as a test bed for next-generation AI aviation systems designed to manage busy airspace more safely. (Archer Aviation)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Archer's airport deal suggests that air taxis are moving closer to everyday use. This shift could mean shorter trips across major cities at a fraction of today's travel time. It could also bring quieter aircraft over neighborhoods compared to helicopters.",
      "For Los Angeles residents, Hawthorne Airport may become a central point for fast point-to-point travel once certification moves forward. Visitors flying in for major events like the LA28 Olympics could see air taxis as a smooth alternative to gridlocked freeways.",
      "Businesses may gain new options for rapid transport across the region. The move also signals more investment and jobs in advanced aviation, automation and clean electric travel.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Archer's acquisition of Hawthorne Airport marks a major milestone in the race to build a real air taxi network, giving the company the aircraft, funding and prime location it needs to push the industry forward. Its focus on AI-driven operations shows how automated aviation may soon play a much bigger role in daily life, even as regulators are still working out how to safely integrate these aircraft into crowded cities. At the same time, the move is already sparking backlash from neighbors who worry about more noise and safety risks and being turned into a test site for AI-guided aircraft without a real say. If Archer can win over regulators, investors and the communities living just beyond the fence line, this step could make the future of urban flight feel much closer, for better or worse.",

      "The fake apps flooding app stores exist on a spectrum of harm, and understanding that range is crucial before you download any AI tools. Take the \"DALL\u00b7E 3 AI Image Generator\" found on Aptoide. It presents itself as an OpenAI product, complete with branding that mimics the real thing. When you open it, you see a loading screen that looks like an AI model generating an image. But nothing is actually being generated.",
      "Network analysis by Appknox showed the app connects only to advertising and analytics services. There's no AI functionality, just an illusion designed to collect your data for monetization.",
      "Then there are apps like WhatsApp Plus, which are far more dangerous. Disguised as an upgraded version of Meta's messenger, this app hides a complete malware framework capable of surveillance, credential theft and persistent background execution. It's signed with a fake certificate instead of WhatsApp's legitimate key and uses a tool often used by malware authors to encrypt malicious code.",
      "Once installed, it silently requests extensive permissions, including access to your contacts, SMS, call logs, device accounts and messages. These permissions allow it to intercept one-time passwords, scrape your address book and impersonate you in chats. Hidden libraries keep the code running even after you close the app. Network logs show it uses domain fronting to disguise its traffic behind Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud endpoints.",
      "Not every clone is malicious. Some apps identify themselves as unofficial interfaces and connect directly to real APIs. The problem is that you often can't tell the difference between a harmless wrapper and a malicious impersonator until it's too late.",
      "Clones hide spyware that can access messages, passwords and contacts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Users and businesses are equally at risk",
      "The impact of fake AI apps goes far beyond frustrated users. For enterprises, these clones pose a direct threat to brand reputation, compliance and data security.",
      "When a malicious app steals credentials while using your brand's identity, customers don't just lose data but also lose trust. Research shows customers stop buying from a brand after a major breach. The average cost of a data breach now stands at 4.45 million dollars, according to IBM's 2025 report. In regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, such breaches can lead to violations of GDPR, HIPAA and PCI-DSS, with fines reaching up to 4% of global turnover.",
      "These impostors harm both users and brands, leading to costly data breaches and lost trust. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8 steps to protect yourself from fake AI apps",
      "While the threat landscape continues to evolve, there are practical measures you can take to protect yourself from malicious clones and impersonators.",
      "A quality mobile security solution can detect and block malicious apps before they cause damage. Modern antivirus programs scan apps for suspicious behavior, unauthorized permissions and known malware signatures. This first line of defense is especially important as fake apps become more sophisticated in hiding their true intentions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Apps like WhatsApp Plus specifically target credentials and can intercept passwords typed directly into fake interfaces. A password manager autofills credentials only on legitimate sites and apps, making it significantly harder for impostors to capture your login information through phishing or fake app interfaces.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Given that malicious clones can steal personal information, intercept SMS verification codes and even impersonate users in chats, identity theft protection provides an additional safety net. These services monitor for unauthorized use of your personal information and can alert you if your identity is being misused across various platforms and services.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "While some sophisticated malware can intercept SMS codes,\u00a02FA still adds a critical layer of security. Use authenticator apps rather than SMS when possible, as they're harder to compromise. Even if a fake app captures your password, 2FA makes it significantly more difficult for attackers to access your accounts.",
      "Security patches often address vulnerabilities that malicious apps exploit. Regular updates to your operating system and legitimate apps ensure you have the latest protections against known threats. Enable automatic updates when possible to stay protected without having to remember manual checks.",
      "Stick to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store rather than third-party marketplaces. While fake apps can still appear on official platforms, these stores have security review processes and are more responsive to removing malicious applications once they're identified. Third-party app stores often have minimal or no security vetting.",
      "Check the developer name carefully. Official ChatGPT apps come from OpenAI, not random developers with similar names. Look at the number of downloads, read recent reviews and be suspicious of apps with few ratings or reviews that seem generic. Legitimate AI tools from major companies will have verified developer badges and millions of downloads.",
      "Even if you avoid downloading fake apps, your personal information may already be circulating on data broker sites that scammers rely on. These brokers collect and sell details like your name, phone number, home address and app usage data, information that cybercriminals can use to craft convincing phishing messages or impersonate you.",
      "A trusted data removal service scans hundreds of broker databases and automatically submits removal requests on your behalf. Regularly removing your data helps reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for malicious actors and fake app networks to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The AI boom has driven massive innovation, but it has also opened new attack surfaces built on brand trust. As adoption grows across mobile platforms, enterprises must secure not only their own apps but also track how their brand appears across hundreds of app stores worldwide. In a market where billions of AI app downloads have happened, the clones aren't coming. They're already here, hiding behind familiar logos and polished interfaces.",

At first, I thought it was just a way for a guy to sell more reports, but after thinking about it for a while, it seems like it could be a great way to harvest credit card numbers, etc. I have not been a victim of this, but in the course of selling a car recently, I had several instances of this.

      "The holiday season is the happiest and riskiest time of year to be online. As millions of us gear up for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, scammers do the same.",
      "Every year, they target holiday shoppers with fake websites, \"too-good-to-be-true\" deals and scam emails that look identical to legitimate retailers. But here's the part most people miss: scammers don't just rely on luck. They already have your personal data before you even click \"add to cart.\"",
      "From leaked email addresses to exposed phone numbers and home addresses, your personal information is being bought and sold by data brokers, companies that collect and resell detailed profiles about you. Those profiles are exactly what scammers use to send realistic \"order confirmations,\" fake delivery alerts and \"urgent payment\" texts during this holiday period and beyond.",
      "Let's unpack how this works and what you can do now to stay safe before the holiday chaos begins.",

      "Scammers ramp up fake websites and emails during the holiday shopping rush. (iStock)",
      "Why scammers love the holiday season",
      "November through December is a goldmine for cybercriminals. According to the CISA, reports of online shopping scams spike during this time of year and vary in their approaches. The reason? We let our guard down when we're rushed, distracted or excited by a deal. Staying alert during the holiday season can help you avoid data exposure and financial losses. Here are some of the most common scams you should be aware of.",
      "The surge of promotions during the holiday season is the perfect time for \"phantom stores\" to thrive. It's a fraudulent store that mimics the interface and products of a well-known brand. Once you purchase from such a website, you'll never receive your order as the store doesn't actually exist.",
      "Real-world example: Fake IKEA websites appeared with URLs spelled \"ikeaa-sale.com\" and \"ikea-blackfriday.shop,\" mimicking the official ikea.com interface with copied product images, logos and discount banners.",
      "They lured shoppers with huge discounts and clearance offers to steal credit card data. Eventually, they were reported and taken down, but the damage has been done.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Always check the URL of the store you shop at and only click links from the store's official website or social media.",
      "According to recent research, some of the most popular shopping apps like Temu are selling your location data to third parties. It's no surprise that you might receive fake delivery texts.",
      "Your leaked data fuels realistic \"order\" and \"delivery\" scams online. (iStock)",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "Real-world example: Temu is a popular app for scammers to mimic. They can easily find your contact information and order details to text \"Your order couldn't be delivered.\" Each text contains a phishing link that can install malware on your device or steal your personal information. That's why Temu warns its users about the couriers they partner with.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Make sure the texts you receive come from a legit courier service and double-check it on the store's website.",
      "Some scammers use sophisticated phishing tactics to lure victims. They engineer emails from well-known brands, use an urgent tone, place malicious links and urge you to click on your order status. In reality, there is no order status \u2013 they're stealing your data.",
      "Real-world example: Amazon is one of the biggest online retailers worldwide, and that makes the brand easy to mimic. Scammers send emails on behalf of Amazon to try to steal customers' personal data because it's highly likely that their victims have used Amazon, making it less suspicious. However, phishing emails have some telltale signs you can look out for.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Never click on any suspicious links and always check the sender's contact information.",
      "When you shop online, you should be aware of the data you share, including your contact information, shopping habits, credit card details and more. All stores collect some type of data about you. However, some companies collect more than you think.",
      "Real-world example: The infamous Target controversy in 2012 revealed how big retailers use data analysis to predict your shopping behavior. The company collected shopping data and managed to produce a predictive model for soon-to-be mothers.",
      "They sent out brochures with baby clothes, vouchers for baby formula and more before the customers even knew they were pregnant. Thankfully, modern shopping looks a bit different. You can opt out of certain data collection and exercise your right to remove personal information from websites that collect it.",

      "THE TRUTH BEHIND THOSE MYSTERIOUS SHIPMENT EMAILS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "How scammers find you",
      "Imagine you're browsing for gifts online. Within minutes, your activity generates data points \u2013 device info, IP address, browsing habits that feed into online databases. At the same time, data brokers already have your full profile: age, income, address history, family members and even shopping behavior. These profiles are sold to marketers and often leak into criminal databases.",
      "That's why scam calls, texts and emails often feel so \"real.\" They use your name, the right retailer, even your city. They're not guessing. They've bought your digital footprint.",
      "The \"holiday cleanup\" your data needs",
      "Most people clear their browser cookies or delete old emails to \"stay private.\" But that's like locking your front door while leaving all your personal documents on the lawn.",
      "If you want to stop scammers from targeting you this holiday season, you need to remove your personal data from the source, the data broker databases that feed these scams.",
      "That's where a data removal service comes in. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A major national security debate is unfolding, and it affects more than government networks. It touches your home, your devices and the Wi-Fi your family uses every day. The Commerce Department has proposed blocking new sales of TP-Link products after a months-long review into the company\u2019s ties to China, citing a growing TP-Link security risk.",
      "Multiple agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and War, supported that proposal. They believe the company\u2019s connections could expose American networks to foreign influence.",
      "Security experts warn that foreign-backed hackers have targeted home and office routers for years. These devices often act as silent steppingstones that help attackers move deeper into sensitive systems. When compromised, they can expose everything connected to them, including computers, smart home gear, military devices used on base and more.",
      "This potential ban would be one of the biggest consumer tech actions in U.S. history. It comes as lawmakers raise fresh alarms about Chinese-made cameras, routers and connected home products sold on military exchanges and in homes across the country.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "CHINESE HACKERS BREACH US NUCLEAR SECURITY AGENCY IN CYBERATTACK OPERATION, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "The proposed TP-Link ban stems from growing concerns that foreign-linked routers and cameras could expose American homes and networks to outside influence. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why military families are even more vulnerable",
      "Lawmakers from both parties say military households face extra risk. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who leads a bipartisan group of 23 lawmakers, warns that TP-Link cameras and networking devices sold on Army, Navy and Air Force exchange sites could expose sensitive footage from base housing and dorms. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, echoed that concern, saying these devices could act as a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to collect information on service members and their families. Even when products appear out of stock, officials worry they remain popular in military communities.",
      "These lawmakers say Chinese laws could force companies to share data or push hidden software changes that weaken U.S. networks. They argue that this creates a real risk for households on or near military installations. While TP-Link disputes every allegation and states that it stores U.S. data inside America, lawmakers want a deeper investigation.",
      "\"China will use any way to infiltrate us, and we must ensure they cannot access our homeland or military bases,\" said Ernst. \"High-tech security cameras sending video and audio directly back to Beijing must be treated like the grave threat that they are. We have seen this playbook from China before, with Huawei Technologies, and need the Trump administration to investigate and determine if TP-Link is a Trojan horse compromising our national security.\"",
      "10M AMERICANS HIT IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR DATA BREACH",
      "How Congress is responding to TP-Link security risks",
      "Ernst is pressing the Commerce Department to finish its investigation by Nov. 30. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, says TP-Link could give the Chinese government access to American networks and wants faster action. Their concerns reflect past decisions involving Huawei and Kaspersky, which lost access to the U.S. market due to national security risks.",
      "Congressional leaders say foreign-made smart home devices sold on military bases should face strict scrutiny. They see routers, cameras and other connected home gear as critical targets in a time when cyberthreats continue to grow.",
      "We reached out to TP-Link Systems Inc., and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"TP-Link Systems Inc. (TP-Link), an American company based in California, refutes the claims in this letter. This letter repeats false and misleading media reports and attacks that have been thoroughly debunked.\"",
      "\"TP-Link emphatically objects to any allegation it is tied to the Communist Party of China, dependent on the Chinese government, or otherwise subject to interference under Chinese national security laws,\" the TP-Link spokesperson said. \"The company is not controlled by any government, foreign or domestic. TP-Link has split from and has no affiliation with the China-based TP-LINK Technologies Co. Ltd., which is separately owned and operated.",
      "Lawmakers warn that TP-Link devices sold on military bases may put service members and their families at greater risk, especially inside base housing. (John Moore/Getty Images)",
      "\"This letter has nothing to do with security and everything to do with a competitor trying to remove TP-Link Systems\u2019 products from the marketplace. The \u2018open source information\u2019 the members reference is actually a manufactured echo chamber of false and misleading attacks that the media has parroted over the past year. Instead of directly engaging with TP-Link Systems, these members essentially pressed \u2018copy and paste\u2019 on unsubstantiated claims about our American company.",
      "\"TP-Link has not been contacted by policymakers to discuss the alleged concerns, but if we were to meet with them, they would learn that TP-Link has located its core security functions and data infrastructure in the United States. U.S. user data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services infrastructure in Virginia, under the full control of the company\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "\"TP-Link Systems currently holds a very small share of the U.S. security camera market, representing approximately 3% of the consumer market segment according to Circana checkout data. The company has virtually no business presence in the enterprise segment. Additionally, TP-Link Systems' router market share in the U.S. has been inaccurately reported as being much higher than it actually is. Recent market research from Dell\u2019Oro Group, Inc., found that TP-Link Systems' market share of residential Wi-Fi router sales in North America is under 10%.",
      "\"TP-Link does not enable foreign surveillance of U.S. networks or users. The company\u2019s operations are built to prevent potential attempts to subvert its business by outside influence. TP-Link\u2019s substantial security investments cover its entire product portfolio, including security cameras and routers.",

      "Coordinated counterterrorism raids across Europe have uncovered what Israeli authorities describe as a significant Hamas network preparing attacks against Israeli and Jewish civilians. The joint effort involved the Mossad and multiple European intelligence and law enforcement agencies working across several countries.",
      "According to the statement released by Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Office on behalf of the Mossad for Intelligence and Special Operations, the dismantled network was part of a broader effort by Hamas leadership to establish terror infrastructure across the continent. Israeli officials refer to the network as the \"Hamas Octopus,\" describing operational cells, weapons hideouts and logistical channels intended to activate attacks \"on command.\"",
      "A senior Israeli intelligence official familiar with the details told Fox News Digital, \"There are active cells across Europe right now, already on their way to targets, and the public \u2014 along with law-enforcement bodies in these countries \u2014 must be significantly more alert as this activity continues.\"",

      "One of the pivotal discoveries was made in Vienna this past September, when Austria\u2019s security and intelligence service (DSN) located a weapons hideout containing pistols and explosive materials. Israeli authorities say the cache belonged to Hamas operative Muhammad Naim, the son of senior Hamas political bureau member in Gaza, Bassem Naim, who is described as close to Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya.",
      "As European agencies coordinated their investigation, Israeli officials uncovered information linking the Vienna activity to developments outside Europe. Israel says a meeting took place in Qatar in September between Muhammad Naim and his father. The timing, according to Israel, suggests possible involvement by Hamas leadership abroad in advancing the network\u2019s activities despite repeated public denials by senior movement figures. Israeli officials add that such denials may indicate a loss of control over \"rogue operatives.\"",

      "The investigation widened further to Turkey, which Israeli authorities describe as \"a convenient area of activity for Hamas operatives, both past and present.\" European intelligence services are examining possible Hamas-linked plots tied to operatives moving through Turkish territory. In November, German authorities arrested a prominent figure in the network, Burhan al-Khatib, after a stay in Turkey, \"likely after completing his operational activity on European soil,\" according to Israel.",
      "The senior Israeli intelligence official said that Turkey \u2014 despite its friendship with the White House and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s close ties with Washington \u2014 shows \"unmistakable signs of involvement. This includes the arrest in Germany of a Hamas operative who arrived directly from Turkey.

      "The flu has started spreading earlier than usual in some parts of the country, prompting concerns that cases could soon erupt as millions of Americans travel and gather for Thanksgiving and other upcoming holidays.",
      "The warning signs come as a form of the virus, called H3N2 subclade K, has set off massive outbreaks in Canada and the U.K.",
      "Dr. Cameron Wolfe, an infectious disease specialist at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, said he\u2019s noted a sharp increase in flu cases over the past few weeks.",
      "\u201cTypically, I might see one or two cases a week at this point,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019ve had two, three, four per day coming in.\u201d",
      "Alicia Budd, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s domestic influenza surveillance team, said: \u201cWe certainly do expect we\u2019re going to see influenza activity increasing over the next several weeks.\u201d",

Maybe a hospital hasn\u2019t fully vaccinated its staff,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cThe community in general may not be as protected as it might have been if a virus turns up in January, for example.\u201d",
      "While flu activity is considered low overall, the CDC\u2019s latest flu report shows cases are on the rise. The agency estimates that at least 650,000 people have had the flu so far this season. Around 7,400 people have been hospitalized and 300 have died, according to the report.",
      "The uptick in cases and emergency room visits are occurring mostly in children, Budd said.",
      "Last year, 280 children in the U.S. died from the flu. It was the deadliest flu season ever recorded for children, aside from the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic.",
      "No pediatric deaths have been reported so far this season. Still, the early rise in flu activity is unsettling for doctors who spent last winter watching the virus sweep through schools, day cares and, consequently, hospitals.",

      "\u201cEven in years where the strain in the vaccine may not be as similar to the strains that we\u2019re seeing circulating, we know that the vaccine can help prevent severity of illness,\u201d Budd said.",
      "Doctors across the U.S. are closely monitoring increases in flu cases.",
      "\u201cDoes it turn on our antenna a little bit more? Yes,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Varga, chief physician executive at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey. \u201cIt makes us be even more vigilant at looking at the traditional monitoring we do locally.\u201d",
      "Dr. Melanie Kitagawa, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston, said it\u2019s still not too late to get a flu shot.",

    "summary": "In an interview Malala Yousafzai speaks about her new memoir, friendship, marriage, and her life since being shot by the Talbian.",
    "story": [
      "Over a decade after being shot in the head on a bus in Pakistan and becoming a global activist for women\u2019s rights in the Middle East, Malala Yousafzai is reintroducing herself \u2014 in her own words.",
      "\u201cThere is more to my life,\u201d she tells TODAY.com, explaining that her new memoir, \u201cFinding My Way,\u201d explores her \u201cjourney through college years, making friends, finding love and learning more about my activism and talking about mental health.\u201d",
      "She says it was \u201cimportant for people to know the true me\" through her book: \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the activist perfect version of me. It\u2019s the more real version of me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy story has already been out there in the public eye, and I think it\u2019s a very one-dimensional story that is related to something that happened to me at age 15,\u201d she continues. \u201cI had been defined by the Taliban shooting for such a long time, I wanted to share more about myself.\u201d",
      "In October 2012, Yousafzai was the victim of targeted shooting by members of the Taliban, following years of public activism and national recognition in Pakistan. The shooting drew global attention and further ignited Yousafzai\u2019s activism, leading her to be named among TIME magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Most Influential People in the World\u201d in 2013. The following year, at the age of 17, Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for young people\u2019s education rights.",
      "When asked what she finds is the most misunderstood part of her story, Yousafzai says, \u201cthat I am actually a funnier person than people think.\u201d",
      "\u201cI actually like to have moments of laughter and joy,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is one of the ways in which I cope with the workload and all that I have experienced. I like spreading joy.\u201d",
      "Prior to the shooting that altered the course of her life, Yousafzai says she was \u201cthis jolly and fun, entertaining\u201d kid growing up in Pakistan \u2014 adding she was even \u201ca bit mischievous\u201d and \u201cliked to get into trouble.\u201d",
      "But once she moved to the United Kingdom to attend Oxford University, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt that I had to live up to the expectation of being an activist. I received so many awards and titles at such a young age that I thought maybe all of this means I cannot be a normal girl anymore,\u201d Yousafzai explains. \u201cI think I was not true to myself as an activist.\u201d",
      "Starting college, Yousafzai says she had the \u201cwrong perception of what the activist life should look like,\u201d which she assumed meant she didn\u2019t have access to \u201cnormal things,\u201d like making friends and falling in love.",
      "\u201cSomehow you have to be stronger and more courageous at everything. You cannot have moments of breakdowns, moments of self doubt,\u201d she says. She would tell herself in difficult times, \u201c\u2018No, you\u2019re supposed to be brave and strong and you\u2019re not going to feel a different way.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over the course of her time at Oxford, however, Yousafzai\u2019s perceptions were shattered and reconstructed.",
      "She tells TODAY.com, \u201cI fell in love, I made friends, I had a mental health breakdown \u2014 all of those things happened all at once. I felt like I was a different person, and I\u2019m grateful for it because it helped me grow.\u201d",
      "How Friendship, a Bong, Therapy and Love Changed Malala Yousafzai\u2019s Life",
      "When she first arrived at Oxford, Yousafzai says she \u201csigned up for every club and society\u201d to meet as many people as possible, despite it feeling \u201cquite awkward and embarrassing\u201d at the time. She adds, \u201cI do not regret it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI struggled to make friends, I struggled to have these normal moments of joy,\u201d she continues. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made a deliberate choice to actually socialize, to actually choose socializing over studying at college, because I wanted to make friends. I wanted to connect with my old self and somehow relive my childhood in my 20s.\u201d",
      "She assumed her fellow classmates would expect her to be \u201ca very serious, boring person, that I only talk about activism,\u201d Yousafzai says, adding, \u201cI just also thought that people may not approach me, thinking that I have nothing fun to say to be part of their friend circle.\u201d",
      "Feeling the pressure to \u201clive up to the expectation\u201d she thought others already set for her, Yousafzai says she realized that people can \u201cinternalize expectation so much that we lose personal identity.\u201d",
      "She explains she had to \u201cdo a lot of unlearning\u201d around who she thought she was.",
      "Once Yousafzai found her people, the \u201cunlearning\u201d began.",
      "\u201cFriendship actually changed me as a person,\u201d she says, noting that the people she surrounded herself with provided the \u201csafest place\u201d to truly express herself without judgement.",
      "One night when her friends were smoking out of a bong, Yousafzai says she opted to try it for the first time, not expecting to be brought back seven years earlier, to October 2012.",
      "\u201cThat brought back flashbacks of the Taliban attack,\u201d she reveals. \u201cThen, after that, I started getting panic attacks and anxiety, and it went on for months.\u201d",
      "When her friend suggested she see a therapist, Yousafzai says she was reluctant, explaining that conversations around mental health are \u201ctaboo\u201d with \u201ca lot of stigma attached to it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember my first therapy session. I told the therapist all the problems that I had, and then said, \u2018OK, give me the medication. Let\u2019s just fix it,\u2019\u201d Yousafzai says, laughing. \u201cShe helped me understand that this is not how it works. It\u2019s actually a process.\u201d",
      "Through therapy Yousafzai has been able to redefine \u201cbravery and courage,\u201d saying she now understands that \u201cwhen you decide to still do what you believe in, even in these moments of difficulty, maybe that is true courage and bravery.\u201d",
      "Amid her therapy journey, Yousafzai had another curve ball thrown her way, emotionally speaking: She fell in love.",
      "\u201cI was excited, I was thrilled, but I was also scared and worried,\u201d Yousafzai recalls of falling for her now husband, Asser Malik.",
      "In Pakistani culture, a couple is not supposed to live together until they tie the knot, she explains. Because she wanted to live with Malik, Yousafzai says she suddenly had to consider the \u201cheavy and overwhelming\u201d decision around marriage.",
      "\u201cI had been so scared of marriage growing up because I saw girls married off when they were still in school, and it just meant that their future, their dreams, were taken away. But I also knew that marriage has meant more compromises for women from their career and many other things in their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSomehow, just the concept of marriage as an institution just scared me.\u201d",
      "Along with her research, which included reading a myriad of books by \u201camazing feminist authors,\u201d Yousafzai says specific conversations with Malik ultimately led to her agreeing to marry him \u2014 \u201cand I do not regret it for a second.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew that he was the right person because he had so much respect for me. He made me feel comfortable with myself. Of course, we were in love with each other, but I started loving myself, and that was a big change,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cSo when you are with the right person, life becomes more beautiful.\u201d",
      "Reflecting on 15-Year-Old Malala Yousafzai",
      "It\u2019s been 13 years since Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban at just 15. Now 28, she has a message for that teenage girl.",
      "\u201cMy younger self was very strong and determined, and I want to tell her that I\u2019m still determined, but I have grown beautifully so much in these years,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cI know that there have been moments of difficulty, but all of that has transformed me into the person I am today.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am a young woman and I am really happy with where I am because I am working for the right to education for every girl, because I was also once shot for speaking out for girls, and I was banned from learning,\u201d she continues.",
      "\u201cSo I want to see that change for girls everywhere, that no girl should witness that. And I\u2019m trying to do everything that I can in my capacity to make the world a better place for girls like you.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding My Way,\u201d Yousafzai\u2019s newest memoir, was released Oct. 21."

      "He was 81.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists, and coworkers who have shared his journey with him,\u201d his wife, Latifa Chambers, wrote on Instagram.",
      "He was best known for songs including \u201cMany Rivers to Cross,\u201d and \u201cThe Harder They Come,\u201d the title song for the movie of the same name from 1972, which featured Cliff. The film\u2019s soundtrack was a major international success and did much to spread the appeal of Jamaican reggae.",
      "Born in Jamaica in 1944, Cliff scored his first local hit aged just 14 with \u201cHurricane Hattie\u201d and would go on to win two Grammy awards and pick up seven nominations.",
      "He was only one of two Jamaicans to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Bob Marley. He was inducted in 2010, with an introductory speech from Wyclef Jean. An essay commemorating Cliff from writer Rob Bowman said that if he had done nothing but star in \u201cThe Harder They Come,\u201d he would have merited inclusion.",

      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "Marissa Bode first saw \"Wicked\" at the age of 12 after her mother surprised her with tickets to see the Broadway show.",
      "What she didn't know then was that merely a decade later, she'd find herself starring in the big-screen version opposite Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande in a blockbuster that smashed box office records after its release in 2024.",
      "\"I'm so grateful for this experience and \u2014 especially my first ever experience,\" Bode, 25, tells TODAY.com. \"I'm definitely grateful for that ... to be a part of something so big.\"",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d fans will likely remember that Bode\u2019s character, Nessarose, is born unable to walk because her mother ate too many milk flowers during her pregnancy out of fear of having another baby with green skin like Nessarose's maligned sister, Elphaba (Erivo).",
      "The show has been on Broadway since 2003, but, Bode is the first actor who uses a wheelchair to be cast in the role of Nessarose.",
      "In \"Wicked\" Part 1, Bode's character is full of youthful hope and in love with Boq (Ethan Slater), the Munchkin boy she falls for while at a dance at the Ozdust Ballroom, and whom she believes returns her affection.",
      "Fast forward to \"Wicked: For Good. Set one year later, Nessarose is Munchkinland's newest governor, a dark, controlling workaholic who learns Boq, her true love, has actually been pining for Glinda (Grande) the entire time.",
      "It's this betrayal that sets Nessarose up as one of the sequel's villains \u2014 a label Bode says is largely undeserved.",
      "\"I think Nessa is totally misunderstood. I think sometimes people can mix the bigger picture and just write her off as the villain or inherently evil,\" Bode says. \"But I think the point of the film is to really show that all of these characters really have so many layers.\"",
      "In \"Wicked: For Good,\" Nessarose transforms from a happy, young girl to an isolated, cold woman \u2014 a metamorphosis Bode calls \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven the whole dance scene, I think that hit close to home, because I do have other disabled friends where something similar has happened,\u201d Bode explains.",
      "\u201cWhere people are friends with them from a distance or they are asked out, but it\u2019s only for a photo op or something to make the other person feel good type of thing, rather than really caring about them and discarding them when they\u2019re no longer either useful or can benefit them,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Instead of being immoral, Nessarose is simply a product of her circumstances, Bode says.",
      "\"It's her just desperately wanting to hang on to the parts that she feels are good in her life. Wanting to really, so deeply, hold onto the moment of her at the dance, which was one of the happiest nights of her life really,\" she says of her character.",
      "\u201cThen when she finds out that all of it wasn\u2019t true and, in addition to being abandoned by her sister \u2014 or at least that\u2019s how she feels \u2014 and really having nobody left at the end of the day, I think there\u2019s moments of her being like, \u2018Well, I have nothing else to lose,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Nessarose and her estranged sister do briefly reunite after the ousted witch returns to Munchkinland seeking to drum up support for her campaign to restore animals' rights.",
      "After Nessarose confronts Elphaba for her perceived abandonment, she attempts to help Nessarose reunite with Boq. In the process, she makes Nessarose fly, restoring her child-like joy, if only for a brief moment.",
      "The pivotal scene is symbolic in more ways than one.",
      "\u201cI think with a song like \u2018Defying Gravity,\u2019 where one of the lyrics is, \u2018Everyone deserves a chance to fly,\u2019 to me, that\u2019s not just physically flying, it\u2019s also metaphorically and feeling like you\u2019re on top of the world or feeling like you do finally have control of your life in some way and flying on that high,\u201d Bode says.",
      "As for how that felt to film?",
      "\u201cI physically had fun flying in the air. What was most tricky for me was pretending like I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Bode recalls. \u201cI do laugh in it, but going from that and then bringing it back down after, I think was the trick for sure.\u201d",
      "But when she shows Boq that she can fly, he tells her she no longer needs him. He asks if he can leave and profess his love for Glinda.",
      "\"When Boq sees Nessa flying, there's a real clear connection between her and Elphaba in that way,\" Slater tells TODAY.com. \"I think, yes, it's magic, but it's also the kind of power that Elphaba has to fly. So I think that, in some ways, informs where the fear goes.\"",
      "Nessarose reacts by trying to force him to love her \u2014 through magic. She attempts to cast a love spell using Elphaba's Grimmerie, but it results in Boq's heart shrinking. To save his life, Elphaba turns him into the Tin Man of \"The Wizard of Oz\" lore.",
      "The physical transformation into the Tin Man took Slater up to five hours. But Slater suggests Boq remains more similar than different.",
      "\"I think it was really important to me that Boq, pre-transformation, is the same Boq, post-transformation. From his point of view, the world around him is changing, and he's just responding to it,\" Slater says.",
      "Nessarose and Boq both meet tragic fates in \"Wicked.\" Boq loses his humanity, while Nessa dies after Madame Morrible brings a tornado (yes, that tornado) to Oz, resulting in a house falling on her.",
      "But the characters' actors are looking to the future. Slater is set to star in the play \"Marcel on the Train,\" which opens on Broadway Feb. 22.",
      "Bode says she's grateful for the opportunity she's had to be part of something so epic, but at the same time, is ready to move on.",
      "\"I think I'm just someone that can't have the same scenery for too long,\" she explains. \"I love playing around and wearing a number of different hats, so I'm looking forward to the future.\""

      "\"That's why we say, the 12 turnings of the tide \u2014 I don't know if you could hear (Michelle Yeoh's Madame Morrible) say that\u00a0\u2014 but she said, 'It has been 12 tide turns,'\" Holzman says. \"We were trying to find a way to say it that didn't sound just like our world.\"",
      "Holzman says the goal was to subtly tell audiences that a \"substantial amount of time\" has passed, but not \"an endless amount.\"",
      "\"It has to be that amount of time where a lot has happened, but Elphaba could start to feel discouraged. If it was three months, you know, she would be in a different headspace,\" she says.",
      "Holzman's co-writer, Dana Fox, adds they also wanted to establish a feeling of \"nostalgia.\"",
      "\"We wanted it to feel like that nostalgia of looking back at your youth that we could actually unearth that feeling in people,\" Fox says.",
      "\"A year felt like exactly the right amount of time. You know how it is when you've had a big year where so much has changed in your life \u2014 that's this year,\" she adds. \"So it feels bigger than what it is but it's a year.\"",
      "They also decided to make it a year to connect with the audience, which was introduced to the film world of \"Wicked\" this time last year.",
      "\"That will be what the audience's experience was because they saw the year ago,\" Fox says. \"So we wanted them to come along with the girls in that way.\"",
      "\"But I purposefully didn't want it to say 'one year,'\" Holzman adds.  \"I mean that's so not Oz.\"",
      "As for how they settled on \"tide turns\" as a unit of measure?",
      "\"Jon (M. Chu) has so much beautiful water imagery in both movies,\" Holzman says. \"Water is such a symbol of the unconscious, of the dream-like state, where you go deeper and you analyze.\"",
      "Plus (slight spoiler alert): Water is ultimately what \"kills\" Elphaba, as established in the \"Wizard of Oz,\" Fox points out.",
      "\"It's also very feminine,\" she says.",
      "Holzman and Fox say they considered all of these meanings as they wrote the script \u2014 even for just those two words.",
      "\"We're going deep, because these kind of things, even though the audience might go, 'Well I didn't make all those connections' \u2014 you don't have to, but they're in there somewhere,\" Holzman says.",
      "\"And we wanted to create a movie where if you watched it 20 times, you could get something new each time you watched it,\" Fox adds."

      "The bromance between Jonathan Bailey and Jeff Goldblum is the real deal.",
      "In fact, it's probably best that the co-stars share just about one scene between \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good\" because, like a couple of kids who need to be separated in class, nothing's going to get accomplished as long as they're in the same room.",
      "\"I'm the Robin to his Batman,\" Bailey says of Goldblum to TODAY.com.",
      "\"I'm the Cher to his Sonny,\" Goldblum replies.",

      "Goldblum has been a staple of the big screen starting from his memorable one-liner in \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d back in 1977, to appearing in blockbuster films like \"Independence Day,\" \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" and \"Jurassic Park.\"",
      "Bailey began his career as a stage actor before making headlines as a royal in the Netflix hit \"Bridgerton,\" as well as earning an Emmy nod for his 2023 turn in the series \"Fellow Travelers.\"",

      "During what Bailey and Goldblum mourn as their final joint interview of the \"Wicked: For Good\" press tour, the two friends banter, ponder plot points (spoilers ahead!) and discuss why the film is exactly the right movie at the right time.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Jonathan Bailey: We were just talking about that.",
      "Jeff Goldblum: We were just talking about that because ...",
      "JB: He lands in the opening sequence of his spinoff (laughing).",
      "JG: The Gregory Maguire books, I think there are seven of them, I think there's a lot of material that probably answers a lot of questions. I was just asking (Maguire) about what happens to Fiyero ... what is that nothingness place? I think it's described in some of those books. What are they going to do?",
      "You saw the movie? Did you get the idea that (Fiyero) is now eternal? Lives forever as a straw person? I have to see it many more times.",
      "JB: (Elphaba and Fiyero) have a family.",
      "JG: They have children ... you were saying. In the books, they have children.",
      "JB: Yes.",
      "JG: There are a bunch of books. And Frank Baum (author of \"The Wizard of Oz\") wrote a bunch of books at the beginning of the 1900s, so there's material galore.",
      "JB: I just want a film called \"Wizard\" with Jeff (laughing). But you would play every part like \"Big Momma\u2019s House.\"",
      "JG: I\u2019d like to see \"Momma\u2019s House.\" Or, I'd like to see Fiyero and Elphaba in the \"Dunescape.\"",
      "JB: We'll call it ... \"Making Hay.\" (Laughing)",
      "JG: \"Making Hay,\" excellent. (Laughing)",
      "JB: Making hay, all day and night. (Laughing)",
      "JG: I think, it's very serious. It's like \"Scenes From a Marriage,\" and we cover the next 20 years of their relationship.",
      "JB: It was all prosthetics. There\u2019s no CGI, there\u2019s no special effects. It\u2019s an extraordinary thing to be in any sort of film that celebrates the creative arts in the way that (\u201cWicked\u201d) does and I think everyone\u2019s been able to flex years of craft.",
      "It was four-and-a-half hours every morning. It was Mark (Coulier), who\u2019s an extraordinary designer, who came up with this burlap texture and it was the first conversation I had with Frances (Hannon), to think about where the literal transformation ends.",
      "There's so much that we sort of explored, the physicality, obviously with a nod to Ray Bolger (the original Scarecrow in \"The Wizard of Oz\").",
      "There's footage of a camera test which made me ... I kind of started crying because it was so reminiscent of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and it was me and Ethan (Slater) as the Tin Man and Bethany Weaver as Dorothy.",
      "They had a chalk slate and we just walked up and down the yellow brick road and we were just exploring the characters. That was almost one of my highlights, actually.",
      "JG: I'd like to see that. There are many things about the ending that intrigue me now. What's the nothingness like? What happens to them? You know, Boq, that's very interesting and savage, his whole thing, it fascinates me. But the two ladies, our main story, wooooow!",
      "JB: The Grimmerie really comes alive.",
      "JG: And does Elphaba now not have the powers that she did with the Grimmerie? And why couldn't she have trusted (Glinda) perhaps? There's a lovely line, \"I have to be wicked so you can be good.\" Glinda is amazing, why couldn't (Elphaba) trust that, \"Hey, we're going to be OK. Don't try to contact us, etc., etc.. Don't tell anybody that we faked it.\"",
      "Or, or is the loss that Glinda experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power, her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she's ever had, really, with Elphaba? Does that trigger her ability to that power?",
      "JB: I think what's going to happen is \"Dune\" Part 3 is coming out in cinemas next year, and I think Fiyero and Elphaba are just going to walk into the shot ...",
      "JG: (Both laughing) And you'll go, \"People ... \"",
      "JB: \"Timmy?",
      "JG: \"Timothee Chalamet?\"",
      "JB: I think the answers always lie in the Grimmerie.",
      "I do think it's particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive and for someone \u2014 Ariana (Grande) charts so brilliantly \u2014 is that the absolute knowledge that (Glinda) has no magic and she no power. To see the Grimmerie come alive, feels to me, like a transference and a conversation between the two women.",
      "JG: Certainly, Elphaba telepathically kind of does that as they commune with each other across the space.",
      "Does Glinda? ... Good question. Does Glinda go, \"I don't think I did that. Are you out there somewhere?\" Maybe it's meant to be ambiguous. Ask Jon M. Chu this question because every moment means something and he, I'm sure, intends and has excavated all the logic behind all of that.",
      "JB: As we know with grief, as well, is that these people do always exist in a different form, don't they? So, in a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together.",
      "JG: Yes, you've changed me for good, meaning both those things, of course, forever.",
      "JB: There's so much hope and optimism in this story and that lies with seeing other sides and being curious about other perspectives. And what a time to be celebrating that idea.",
      "JG: Empathy. Empathy. A valuable commodity, now more than ever. If this movie isn't a machinery for the spread of empathy, I don't know what is.",
      "JB: And it just takes one person. It can be one act of kindness. It can have a ripple effect and one intentional act of radicalism that can inspire and shift.",
      "JG: The pebble in the lake and the spreading rings."

    "published": "Sat, 22 Nov 2025 20:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Oscar-winning actor, Michelle Yeoh, talks \"Wicked: For Good,\" what it took to transform into Madame Morrible and the \"sisterhood\" she shares with her co-stars.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "According to Michelle Yeoh, the real witches in \"Wicked\" aren't the ones you immediately think of. And she'd know, because she's one of them.",
      "\"There were only two witches in the Land of Oz,\" Yeoh tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"It was Madame Morrible and Elphaba.\"",
      "That may come as a surprise to fans of the \"Wizard of Oz\" who think that when it comes to \"Wicked's\" witches, that distinction belongs to the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), and Glinda the Good Witch (Ariana Grande).",
      "But to know the musical is to remember that the only two people with any sort of magical ability in Oz are, in fact, Elphaba and Morrible, not Glinda and definitely not The Wizard.",
      "That's why Yeoh says her character, Madame Morrible, initially aligns herself with Elphaba, before ultimately becoming her biggest adversary.",
      "\"She didn't have quite the gift and talent as Elphaba did. But at that moment, she thought, 'I found my muse. I couldn't do it, but now I have someone who can help me get to where I think it's for the goodness of Oz,'\" explains Yeoh of Madame Morrible's less-than-honorable intentions for the young sorcerer.",
      "If that's not enough to convince you that Morrible is the true wicked witch of the story, consider her initials: \"MM.\" Turn them upside down and what have you got? \"WW,\" which stands for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014\u00a0Wicked Witch.",
      "Without revealing too much, it's safe to say that Madame Morrible gets the ending she deserves in \"Wicked: For Good.\" Even so, it's hard not to wonder if, in spite of her malicious intent, there's anything redeeming about the character.",
      "\"I think the lesson to be learned here is don't get corrupted by your own desires and ambition,\" says Yeoh. \"Because (Madame Morrible) forgot about compassion and kindness, which is something she had right at the beginning. And then she got lost in her own tempest.\"",
      "Bringing the 'Scary' to Madame Morrible",
      "Fresh off the heels of her Oscar win for \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" in 2023, Yeoh stepped into the shoes of the \"Wicked\" character. To portray Madame Morrible, Yeoh says she drew on past experience to give Shiz\u2019s imposing headmistress her commanding presence.",
      "\"I think everything that I've done, especially in the physicality of my life, whether ... from ballet, to contemporary dance, to sports, to diving, to all these kind of things, helped me focus the stillness rather than the chaotic movement.\"",
      "Instead of playing Morrible as an over-the-top villain, Yeoh says she took a more subtle approach and worked at curating Morrible's icy but alluring appeal.",
      "\"This is how she would command respect and awe. It's like, how does she charm them? She draws them in,\" explains Yeoh. \"That's the most scary of all \u2014 when they're charming and personable and they listen to you and it seems like you're the only one in her world.\"",
      "\"With Madame Morrible, this was an art form that she needed to have to have that gravitas,\" she continues.",
      "Morrible's high-collared costumes and elaborate up-dos also contributed to her intimidating stature, Yeoh says.",
      "\"It was the combination of everything that helped me build Madame Morrible to when she walks out, you go back and go, 'Alright, not going to mess with you!'\"",
      "It's not the first time Yeoh has used her inner stillness to bring a character to life. She says she also channeled it for her work in  \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" and the hit 2018 rom-com, \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" which was also directed by Jon M. Chu.",
      "\"The mother, Mrs. Eleanor Young, is also a very commanding figure without being loud, she never raises her voice, but when she speaks with her tone, every gesture is measured with intention. It's not frivolous. It's nothing like that,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"So, when she stops to look at you, you go, \"Okayyyy,\" she adds.",
      "Forging a Sisterhood",
      "Based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire book, \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\" bringing the films \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good\" to the big screen has been a decades-long endeavor that began back in the early 2000s.",
      "Yeoh joined the cast in 2022 and filmed the original and sequel simultaneously along with the rest of the cast, including Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo.",
      "\"You will miss (them), because at the end of the day, you've built up such a great bond and it's a family,\" says Yeoh, who explains that while goodbyes can be hard, they're also an inevitable part of the business.",
      "\"This is how it is, but the good news is if you really bonded, they'll always be there. I'm still in touch with Jamie Lee Curtis, and it's been so many years. And 'Crazy Rich Asians,' we still have a group chat,\" she says.",
      "As for Grande and Erivo, Yeoh says that even though the films are done, what she takes away from her co-stars is a lasting sisterhood.",
      "\"We champion each other. We believe in each other. We support each other. No questions asked, let's just go forward, up and above, let's just do it together,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"And when we're not with each other, we don't forget that will always have the bond.\""

      "\u201cWe\u2019re kind of following Glinda\u2019s ups and downs in terms of, these are the consequences of her choices,\u201d Fox says. \u201cElphaba made a choice and is standing by that choice. So in a way, she\u2019s theoretically changing less, and she\u2019s trying to change the world.",
      "\u201cGlinda is the one who needs some serious changing.\u201d",
      "Here are the most significant changes, additions and expansions found in \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d compared to the original Broadway musical.",
      "The Opening Scene",
      "The stage musical of \u201cWicked\u201d opens with a time jump from Elphaba\u2019s rebellious moment in \u201cDefying Gravity.\u201d The first scene of Act II is \u201cThank Goodness,\u201d sung by Glinda as she seeks to spread joy and raise spirits as the rest of Oz wages war against Elphaba, now dubbed the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "The movie also opens with a time jump \u2014 specifically one year. The first scene though, establishes the new reality in Oz. Animals are used as laborers to build the Wizard\u2019s yellow brick road. It also reveals that since her dramatic departure from the Emerald City, Elphaba has been hijacking the work sites to try and free the animals.",
      "The Animals Escape Oz",
      "Speaking of the animals, \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d also reveals the impact of the Wizard\u2019s propaganda and laws forbidding animals from talking.",
      "In a new scene, Elphaba comes across a group of animals escaping Oz via an underground route. They say they are searching for the mythical Lands Beyond Oz and tell a resistant Elphaba that the uncertainty is safer for them.",
      "To try and persuade them to stay, Elphaba sings her new song, \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d \u2014 but to no avail.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s this extraordinary anthem, and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Fox says. \u201cThe animals don\u2019t stay because she can\u2019t convince them, and the truth is they\u2019re probably right to leave. At that moment they are doing what\u2019s best for them, what is the safest choice for them.\u201d",
      "Elphaba's Spell Gives Nessarose the Ability to Fly",
      "After failing to rally the animals to stay and fight with her, Elphaba goes to her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), who\u2019s now the governor of Munchkinland after the death of their father.",
      "But Nessa, who has stripped munchkins of their right to travel in order to keep her love, Boq (Ethan Slater), by her side, is consumed by resentment. She yells at Elphaba for trying to help animals instead of her. As a result, Elphaba opens her Grimmerie and casts a spell on Nessarose, giving her the ability to fly.",
      "Fans of the stage musical remember that in this scene, Elphaba\u2019s spell gives Nessarose, who uses a wheelchair, the ability to walk.",
      "Marissa Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose and use a wheelchair off-screen. She previously told TODAY that the change from walking to flying in \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d represents \u201cless of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\u201d",
      "Glinda Performs \u2018Wonderful\u2019 With the Wizard",
      "After trying to get her sister\u2019s support, Elphaba goes directly to the Emerald City to try and take on the Wizard.",
      "There, he again tries to get her to join forces with him via a song called \u201cWonderful.\u201d",
      "But in the film, Glinda joins the pair for the song. \u201cWonderful\u201d becomes a duet between Glinda and the Wizard as they both try to convince Elphaba to return to the public\u2019s good graces.",
      "Glinda and Fiyero Almost Get Married",
      "In the stage musical, Glinda and Fiyero are engaged before he ultimately abandons her to run off with Elphaba. In \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d they almost made it down the aisle.",
      "When Elphaba goes to the Emerald City, it turns out to be on Glinda and Fiyero\u2019s wedding day.",
      "After Elphaba\u2019s almost been convinced to join Glinda and the Wizard through their rendition of \u201cWonderful,\u201d she asks the Wizard to free the flying monkeys she accidentally created in Part 1. He complies \u2014 but then she uncovers a secret crevice where the Wizard had kept in cages dozens of animals, including Elphaba\u2019s former professor Dr. Dillamond, preventing them from speaking. Outraged, Elphaba frees all the animals, interrupting Glinda as she walks down the aisle.",
      "\u201cWe wanted the stakes to be higher,\u201d Chu says of the change. \u201cWe wanted to make this sort of intercut parallel between her getting married and (Elphaba\u2019s) reality of finding these animals in cages. The fact that these two, dream and nightmare, could collide at this intersection was really important to break the story.\u201d",
      "When Fiyero, who\u2019s captain of the guard, later finds Elphaba, he decides to escape with her, breaking Glinda\u2019s heart.",
      "Viewers See Dorothy \u2014 But Never Her Face",
      "\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and its characters are intertwined with \u201cWicked\u2019s\u201d story. For example, Boq and Fiyero famously become the Tin Man and the Scarecrow, while the cub that Fiyero and Elphaba rescue as students grows up to be the Cowardly Lion. But what about Dorothy?",
      "In the stage musical, Dorothy is merely seen as a shadow throwing water on Elphaba in the film\u2019s finale. But \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d cast Bethany Weaver to play the part.",
      "Throughout the film, viewers can see Dorothy, her brunette pigtails and her blue plaid dress, but only from the back. Her face is never seen.",
      "That decision was easy, says Chu.",
      "\u201cThere was a mantra that we were taught when we first started this from the people who did the stage show, and they said, \u2018The key is it\u2019s about the girls, stupid.\u2019 ... That has guided our way the whole time,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to Dorothy and all these other characters, those are really fun things, but in movie language, if you see her face, you\u2019re going to want to know who she is, where she comes from, what does she want \u2014 and then the story takes a way left turn,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd this is \u2018about the girls, stupid.\u2019\u201d",
      "Glinda Formally Takes Over as a Leader of Oz",
      "After witnessing Fiyero\u2019s capture and Madame Morrible\u2019s cruelty, Glinda weighs whether to do something or stay complacent in the film\u2019s second brand new song, \u201cGirl in the Bubble.\u201d",
      "\u201cPart of deconstructing the fairy tale \u2014 which is sort of the point of \u2018Wicked,\u2019 to see this American fairytale in a new way, through a new perspective \u2014 part of that was understanding not just what what Elphaba was going through, but also what it means for somebody in a bubble of privilege when the truth is coming out,\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cAt what point does someone who doesn\u2019t have to be affected by this, what kind of courage does it take to actually pop your own bubble and engage and help somebody else? I think that that\u2019s such an important lesson in these days, that courage \u2014 no matter where you missed the moment \u2014 courage has no expiration date, and that we still have time to be the people who we see ourselves as,\u201d he adds.",
      "She ultimately chooses to go to Elphaba\u2019s side. The best friends briefly reconcile with \u201cFor Good\u201d before Elphaba fakes her own death. After escaping, Glinda returns to the Emerald City, forces the departure of the Wizard, arrests Madame Morrible and takes over as a leader of Oz.",
      "And in a slight expansion from the musical, we see exactly what she does with that newfound power: Free the animals.",
      "The Grimmerie Opens for Glinda",
      "Finally, the very end of \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d introduces a scene that is meant to spark discourse. As Elphaba and Fiyero escape to the Lands Beyond Oz, Glinda looks out over the Emerald City. The magic book, the Grimmerie, which Elphaba entrusted to her before her \u201cdeath,\u201d suddenly comes alive and opens beside Glinda.",
      "There are theories about what the Grimmerie\u2019s opening means, even among the cast and crew. Some think it represents Glinda finally having the potential to be a true witch, while others say it\u2019s a message from Elphaba to Glinda.",
      "\u201cWhat I think is great about this book of knowledge, the Grimmerie, I mean, it can be interpreted as many things,\u201d Chu says."

      "\u201cWicked: For Good\u201d brings fans the long-awaited finale to the film adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical. And a small change at the very, very end may signify a big change from the original story.",
      "Like the musical, the story ends with Glinda (Ariana Grande) and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) forced to separate after belting out Act II\u2019s signature song, \u201cFor Good.\u201d Glinda, watching shadows through a cracked door, sees Elphaba melt after Dorothy throws a pail of water at her. Glinda escapes on horseback, shrouded in a black cape. (Yes, Glinda was the mysterious figure we saw escaping a castle in the very first scene of the first \u201cWicked\u201d movie.) She goes on to assume power in Oz as she mourns her best friend\u2019s death.",
      "Only Elphaba isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s hiding in a trapdoor, waiting for her beloved Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) to meet her before they leave for the Land Beyond Oz together.",
      "From there, viewers get a bit of a twist before the movie concludes. Here\u2019s what happens.",
      "How \u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 Ends",
      "The stage version of \u201cWicked\u201d ends with Elphaba and Fiyero leaving Oz, and Glinda stepping into a position of power.",
      "But in \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d viewers see what happens to Glinda after she becomes Oz\u2019s leader. First, she officially declares the land welcome to all animals again.",
      "In the final scene, Glinda looks over the Emerald City as Elphaba and Fiyero trek through a desert to leave Oz. Elphaba looks back for a brief moment. Then Elphaba\u2019s book of spells, the Grimmerie, flutters to life before Glinda\u2019s eyes. Elphaba had given the book to Glinda before Elphaba\u2019s encounter with Dorothy.",
      "As established in the first film, the Grimmerie only opens for and can be read by a true witch, something that, as much as she tried \u2014  whether through begging Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) for sorcery lessons or twirling her practice wand \u2014 Glinda decidedly was not.",
      "So what does the Grimmerie opening mean?",
      "We asked the team behind \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d for their takes on the final scene. See what director Jon M. Chu and stars Cynthia Erivo, Jeff Goldblum and Jonathan Bailey had to say.",
      "How \u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 Stars Interpret the Ending",
      "Chu declines to say \u201cexactly what (the ending) is\u201d by his intention.",
      "But he points to all the different interpretations of what the Grimmerie, \u201ca book of knowledge,\u201d could be, relative to both Glinda and Elphaba.",
      "\u201cWhether (Glinda) finally gets to be who she\u2019s meant to be, that she\u2019s not reliant on this image in this mirror,\u201d Chu says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be good.\u2019 She says, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to be good.\u2019",
      "\u201cJust the effort of trying to be who we\u2019re supposed to be opens and unlocks our unlimited possibilities,\u201d he adds.",
      "The spontaneous opening of the Grimmerie could also relate to the film\u2019s theme of pursuing the truth amid propaganda. By the end of the film, Elphaba\u2019s reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West as told in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is upended by political lies told by the nonmagical Wizard of Oz and, as actor Michelle Yeoh says, the true wicked witch, Madame Morrible. But while viewers know the truth, in the world of the movie, Ozians do not, after Elphaba tells Glinda not to clear her name.",
      "\u201cIt could also be, Cynthia could be Jesus giving us, the humans, this Bible and saying, you know the truth, now what are you going to do with it?\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cI think it is a challenge to us as the audience, whereas maybe movie one was more of an answer. This is more a question and challenge for us to see how we\u2019re going to tell our story to the next generation,\u201d he adds.",
      "Erivo says Elphaba leaving the Grimmerie behind represents her entrusting it to Glinda.",
      "\u201cI think Elphaba\u2019s powers exist independent of the Grimmerie, and because she has certain powers, she\u2019s able to read the Grimmerie. It\u2019s like she and Grimmerie have an intrinsic relationship, and so the Grimmerie answers to her,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cBut her leaving it behind and trusting it to Glinda essentially tells the Grimmerie, \u2018You\u2019re in new hands, trust this person,\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t mean Elphaba\u2019s lost her connection with the book. She says she believes Elphaba in fact can see the Grimmerie opening for Glinda.",
      "\u201cShe has visions, so I think she can see what happens, and she can feel it. And it opening means to her that, one, Glinda\u2019s made the right decision, and two, the Grimmerie trusts Glinda now, so everything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she says.",
      "But does Glinda know Elphaba is watching over her?",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba has something to do with it (opening), but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba\u2019s alive,\u201d Erivo says.",
      "As for Goldblum, who stars as the Wizard of Oz, he is curious what leaving the Grimmerie behind means for Elphaba\u2019s powers. He also wonders: Why couldn\u2019t Elphaba trust Glinda with the knowledge that they survived?",
      "\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she trust that, \u2018Hey we\u2019re going to be OK, don\u2019t try to contact us ... Don\u2019t tell anybody that we faked it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Goldblum says. \u201cOr, is the loss that (Glinda) experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power. Her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she\u2019s ever had with Elphaba, does that trigger her ability to power?\u201d",
      "As for the opening of the Grimmerie, Goldblum says it\u2019s possible for Elphaba to \u201ctelepathically\u201d \u201ccommune\u201d with Glinda across space.",
      "\u201cDoes Glinda go, \u2018I don\u2019t think I did that. Are you out there somewhere. Are you OK?\u2019\u201d he adds. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s meant to be ambiguous.\u201d",
      "Like Goldblum, Bailey believes there\u2019s a chance the opening of the Grimmerie was Elphaba sending Glinda a message.",
      "\u201cI think that the answers always lie in the Grimmerie, and I do think it\u2019s particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive for someone ... (with) the absolute knowledge that she has no magic and that she has no power,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cTo see the Grimmerie come alive feels to me like a transference and a conversation between the two women.\u201d",
      "He believes this, even if it\u2019s not so literal of a conversation or message.",
      "\u201cAs we know with grief as well, those people do always exist in a different form, don\u2019t they? In a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together,\u201d he adds.",
      "Holzman, who wrote the book for \u201cWicked\u201d and co-wrote the screenplays for both films with writer Dana Fox, says the goal for the ending was to create a \u201cmystical moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith something mystical, it\u2019s not like the whole point is you know the answer, it\u2019s that it pulls something out of you, like a spiritual feeling,\u201d she says.",
      "One interpretation of the Grimmerie opening, Holzman says, has to do with the evolution of Glinda\u2019s character.",
      "\u201cShe was willing to let go ... of all the need to be admired in this empty way. And she was willing to be humble, to be a student, to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know everything,\u2019\u201d Holzman says.",
      "Fox adds that the moment Glinda \u201cearns\u201d the Grimmerie opening is when she admits her \u201cdeepest shame\u201d to Elphaba: that she can\u2019t read the Grimmerie and perform spells.",
      "\u201cShe wanted so much to be that magical creature who could make magic happen, and she\u2019s going to end up being that, but it\u2019s going to take hard work,\u201d Holzman says. \u201cAnd to me, the Grimmerie opening is like the Grimmerie saying, \u2018OK, you\u2019re ready.\u2019\u201d",
      "But the question remains: Does Elphaba know?",
      "\u201cI think the thing that really is up to interpretation that everyone should just talk about amongst themselves is, Does Elphaba know? Did she have anything to do with it? I think that is something that just everyone should decide for themselves,\u201d Fox says."

The 15-minute clip began with footage of him on his Nashville farm and ended with Jelly Roll deciding to shave his beard for the first time in over a decade.",
      "He shared that he wanted to shave his beard as he continues his weight loss journey.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m sure some of y\u2019all are exhausted about hearing about my weight loss. But a lot of things change when you start losing weight. You realize things. One of the things I realized is I don\u2019t know what I look like. I\u2019ve had a beard to try to cover up my double chin,\u201d he said.",
      "Jelly Roll added, \u201cThe last time my face was shaved I was fresh out of jail.\u201d",
      "He predicted that he might resemble a Ninja Turtle after shaving his facial hair, but said he wanted to go through with it so he could surprise his family with his new appearance.

There\u2019s not an artist in the world that didn\u2019t grow up watching the Grammys when they were a kid and walk in their bedrooms afterwards and rehearse their speech,\u201d he said. \u201cGod will take something that\u2019s either normal and make it extremely abnormal or he will take something that\u2019s already incredible and make it absolutely mesmerizing, and that\u2019s the case here.\u201d",
      "He said that now he gets to celebrate this achievement while in \u201cthe best headspace.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see all my friends in this category. But then I just see standing there is this album called \u2018Beautifully Broken,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cMan, if that doesn\u2019t represent what\u2019s happening in the world right now. I think more than ever\u2026 I think we can find beauty in what\u2019s happening. Win, lose or draw. Holy f---, dude, we won.\u201d",

      "\u201cHey i love ninja turtles,\u201d a third wrote.",
      "This is the latest dramatic transformation Jelly Roll has shared with his fans. Over the past year, he has also opened up repeatedly about losing weight.",
      "While appearing on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d in April, he said his goal was to be under 250 pounds before explaining why losing weight is important to him.",

      "How it went: Over the course of eight weeks, the newlyweds encountered several highs and lows. They experienced trust issues when Josh claimed that he had unfollowed his ex-girlfriend on social media, but later revealed that he hadn't.",
      "The couple learned that they had a few key personality differences when Josh expressed how passionate he was about attending music festivals, namely Burning Man. Jalyn didn't share the same interest and wasn't sure that she'd feel comfortable attending the event. Josh was concerned that he would lose the sense of community he finds at Burning Man if his wife didn't support his passion.",

      "Josh acknowledged that he envisioned \"a great future\" with his wife and said decision day would \"take a part of me with it\" if Jalyn decided against continuing their marriage.",
      "Meanwhile, Jalyn opened up about her \"biggest reservations\" as she prepared for decision day, saying she and Josh are \"different people\" who are \"in two different lanes in a lot of ways.\"",
      "\"I feel like this is make or break for me. I think in the past anytime I saw a red flag, I ended the relationship but now I'm married and I don't know what you work through and what you don't. But I hope to feel confident and secure in my decision,\" she said.",
      "When decision time arrived, Both Jalyn and Josh decided to stay married and expressed confidence in the way they had addressed obstacles in their relationship so far.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion special, Jalyn revealed that she and Josh broke up three months before filming the reunion. They both had different versions of their breakup story, with Jalyn saying Josh broached the subject while they were on vacation.",
      "\"He looked at me and he said, 'I don't feel connected to you anymore. I want to break up,'\" she recalled.",
      "After agreeing to try to work things out, they went home and a few days later, Josh initiated the breakup again.",
      "Jalyn said she bent over backwards to channel her adventurous side and did attend Burning Man, along with several other music festivals, for Josh. In the end, however, he said she wasn't adventurous enough for him.",
      "Jalyn also claimed that Josh \"lied\" about many things in their relationship, such as telling her a female coworker was younger than he originally stated.",
      "Meghann and Derrek",
      "How it started: When Meghann and Derrek got married, the physical attraction was immediately present. The newlyweds shared a passion for healthy living and seemed to have a lot in common.",
      "How it went: Meghann and Derrek encountered a few issues throughout the experiment. For instance, Derrek thought Meghann was too defensive in their conversations, and she wanted him to be more vulnerable. They also had misaligned expectations on their household roles and duties.",
      "When Meghann discovered that she was pregnant, their relationship shifted for the better, with both of the newlyweds committing to their connection.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: On decision day, Derrek noted that Meghann's pregnancy added \"a whole other element\" to the experiment. Still, he was feeling confident going into the discussion.",
      "On her way to filming, Meghann reflected on the moment, saying, \"We have a lot of things that are gonna hit us, a lot of new things in the future that we're gonna have to figure out. And we need to really work through this.\"",
      "While sitting down with the relationship experts, the couple announced their pregnancy. When the big moment arrived, Derrek went first and shared his decision.",
      "\"You are extremely caring and compassionate and without any hesitation, 100% I want to stay married to you. I love you and I love your sense of humor. I love your pretty smile and your big blue eyes and I am really excited to start a family with you. I think you'll make an amazing mom and I'm just really excited for our future,\" he said.",
      "Meghann told her husband he makes her \"a better person\" and expressed her devotion to him.",
      "\"I am so excited to raise a child with you, so I am choosing to stay married to you because I can't imagine being away from you and I love you,\" she said.",
      "Are they still together? No. After agreeing to stay together in the season finale, the couple experienced a miscarriage. Despite Meghann's suggestion that they go to couples' therapy, they still struggled to communicate. One day, they had a fight and Derrek broke up with his wife over the phone then moved out.",
      "\"There's never a good time to do it. It's always going to be hard. I knew that this wasn't the right person for me. I had to be true to myself and be true to Meghann,\" Derrek said.",
      "Meghann offered her take on the breakup, saying, \"When he broke up with me, something in my head changed and I couldn't remember anything good from our relationship. I just remembered all the bad. And then I watched (the show) and then I remembered all the good and that was hard.\"",
      "Meghann said she doesn't see Derrek as a \"bad person,\" but said he didn't handle their breakup well.",
      "\"I wasn't happy. I don't think Meghann was happy,\" he said.",
      "Rhonda and Pat",
      "How it started: It didn't take long for chemistry to spark between Rhonda and Pat on their wedding day. The couple had plenty of fun at their reception and even jumped in the pool together. It was soon apparent that their fun-loving personalities were a good match.",
      "How it went: Once they started diving deeper in their relationship, Rhonda and Pat hit a few roadblocks. Rhonda told her husband she didn't feel like he was interested in hearing about her life since he regularly made the conversation about him. He was taken aback and tried to remedy the situation.",
      "Still, it was a consistent theme throughout the eight-week experiment for the newlyweds.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: While preparing to make his decision Pat admitted that he was feeling \"conflicted.\"",
      "\"Despite the disconnects and the challenges that Rhonda and I have had, we did make a deep connection. And I feel in my heart that I have established deep love for Rhonda,\" he said.",
      "While reflecting on the decision awaiting her, Rhonda said she wanted Pat to know that she \"really sincerely appreciated him and his commitment to this marriage.\"",
      "\"It's been hard but also it's been everything I think I could have ever hoped for,\" she said.",
      "When it came time to share their decisions, Rhonda said she suspected that Pat didn't want to stay married based on his closed off body language. He then explained that he ignored red flags in his first marriage and didn't want to do that this time around.",
      "\"I do not trust that I will be seen and heard as my authentic self,\" he said.",
      "Rhonda wasn't sure what he meant, so Pat explained that he had struggled hearing her repeatedly allege he didn't care about her.",
      "The relationship experts on hand encouraged the couple to talk through their issues. Rhonda apologized to Pat but said her emotional needs hadn't been met.",
      "\"I just think I've been really, really frustrated with you and my frustration pushes you away. And that's not my intention. I'm struggling on how to deal with it. So I would (like to) apologize for making you feel like I'm pushing you away,\" she said.",
      "Pat thanked his wife and said he went into the discussion not wanting to move forward, but was now thinking he may be \"being too rigid.\"",
      "Ultimately, Pat decided he wanted to continue to work on their marriage. Rhonda said she didn't feel \"as open or hopeful\" as she did going into the discussion, but wasn't ready to give up on their relationship.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Rhonda said she and Pat stayed together for nine months after decision day. At that point, Pat went to Europe for a month on his own. He did invite her to go, but she'd already taken a lot of time off from work and decided to stay home.",
      "When Pat returned home, Rhonda said she was \"on cloud nine\" for a period of 10 days. One day, she saw him listening to a meditation about anger and asked if he was angry that they hadn't slept together since he got home. He was, and at dinner that night he told Rhonda he was done with their relationship.",
      "During the reunion, Pat said he'd felt that way \"for quite some time.\" Rhonda then explained that he was \"very insecure\" and said \"that insecurity was a complete turnoff romantically.\"",
      "Rhonda suggested that Pat only wanted a wife, and not necessarily her, adding that he wanted physical intimacy that would turn into a romantic connection. However, she wanted a connection and said intimacy would be the icing on the cake.",
      "Belynda and Chad",
      "How it started: When Belynda and Chad got married, it was a slow burn at first. However, they both seemed committed to exploring their connection and shared some sweet moments as they got to know each other.",
      "How it went: Chad repeatedly expressed frustration with Belynda's dog sleeping in their bed throughout the experiment. He also grew tired of the filming schedule and said \"I don't give a f--- about this show\" during one heated moment. Still, the couple's connection grew over time.",
      "Before decision day, Belynda said she was doubtful that she'd want to stay married based on Chad's recent aggressive behavior.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: Belynda described her husband as \"kind, funny and sweet\" on decision day but admitted that her marriage had been \"a little exhausting at times.\"",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose my voice. I can\u2019t lose myself in a marriage and I feel like I need to remember that I\u2019m also there and that I also matter,\u201d she said.",
      "In a confessional interview, Chad said he wanted to be with his wife and couldn't \"imagine my life without Belynda.\"",
      "He also acknowledged that he had \"hurt\" his wife at times with his impatience and said he needed \"to find healthier ways to burn off some steam.\"",
      "When the moment to make a decision arrived, Chad went first, saying, \"I genuinely care about you and I believe you care about me. And I don't think there's anything we can't figure out as long as (we keep that in mind).\"",
      "Chad said he was willing to do \"whatever it takes\" to make their marriage work and asked if Belynda was willing to stay together.",
      "\"I mean, I think if anything, if I had a reason to walk away it would just be because we weren't working on it the way we committed and said we were going to. But I know that if we're working on it, we can get through it, so yes, I will stay married to you,\" she replied.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion special, Belynda and Chad announced that they were no longer married.",
      "They both recalled an incident with his cat and her dog after they returned home from decision day, saying Chad was triggered by the animals' behavior and his anxiety came out as he began to yell at Belynda, saying her dog wasn't trained.",
      "Belynda said the incident reminded her of a prior marriage when her ex-husband would yell. She decided to grab her things and left with the dog.",
      "While reflecting on their relationship, Belynda also said Chad's drinking issues were an obstacle for her to overcome.",
      "Brittany and Will",
      "How it started: Brittany and Will had a sweet connection after  they met for the first time at the altar. However, things were understandably a bit awkward at first.",
      "How it went: While getting to know each other, Brittany and Will struggled with communication issues. Brittany wanted her husband to open up and be more expressive with his emotions, but he was slow to show his vulnerable side.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: On decision day, Brittany was \"hopeful\" when she woke up. Then Will called her to say his answer was no. Still, they both showed up to the discussion to talk things out.",
      "Will arrived first and told the relationship experts he intended to leave his marriage.",
      "\"I think that throughout this, her not thinking I'm trying, her not thinking that I'm doing anything, her not feeling anything from what I'm doing, that was the theme,\" he said.",
      "Will went on to say that his wife \u201ctries to compare things to how she feels them\u201d and said \u201cif it\u2019s not how she feels, then it doesn't matter and it's not validated.\u201d",
      "When Brittany arrived, she apologized to her husband for not being able to \"express how important\" he was to her. She then called him \"the most kind, genuine, thoughtful person.\"",
      "\"I'm just so sorry if I haven't made you feel that way, if I haven't made you feel like you're important to me and your feelings are important to me, because they are,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm thankful that I was able to make you feel those things in those ways. I didn't know,\" Will replied.",
      "Will said he needed more time and walked away to gather his thoughts. When he returned, Will decided to give their marriage another try.",
      "\"Yes, I do want to be with you and I do want to continue this and I want to learn with you,\" he said.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Brittany revealed that she and Will hadn't spoken together since the show ended. She recalled how he went away for work for a week after the finale then ended things when he returned.",
      "Will shared his side of the story, saying he did \"adore\" Brittany and decided to stay with her in the heat of the moment since he didn't want to see her sad. However, she said she \"had an inkling\" that they would break up when he returned home."

    "story": [
      "The pressure building on Ukraine is not just diplomatic.",
      "While President Donald Trump pushes for a quick resolution, the churning mud of the battlefield has produced only slow and painstaking gains for the Kremlin during the four years since its full-scale invasion.",
      "From the front-line city of Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk to Zaporizhzhia in the south and the northern region of Kharkiv, there is little doubt that Russia is making advances.",
      "President Vladimir Putin has urged Ukraine to surrender key territory at the negotiating table \u2014 as Washington has suggested \u2014 or face Moscow's military taking it by force anyway. Trump has echoed this sentiment, warning that Ukraine \"will lose in a short period of time\" if it does not agree to the deal he has backed.",
      "But battlefield monitors suggest the picture is not quite so bleak for Ukraine as Trump and Putin suggest.",
      "Russia's gains are slow and incremental, won at a heavy cost against Kyiv\u2019s overstretched army, according to these mostly Western observers, who see Moscow as overstating its position for diplomatic gain in negotiations with Washington.",
      "Pokrovsk, a transit hub that has been the center of the fighting for months, could soon hand the Kremlin its first major capture in two years.",
      "Yet, Russia would not be able to take the rest of Donetsk \"without significant casualties, probably in the hundreds of thousands,\" Chris Parry, a former NATO commander and rear admiral in the British Royal Navy, told NBC News in an interview. If Ukraine gives that up in a deal, it \"will leave the rest of the country vulnerable to a strike anytime that Putin wants to come back,\" he said.",
      "Indeed, since Aug. 15, Russia has has been advancing at \"foot pace,\u201d gaining just 3\u00bd square miles a day, according to an analysis Sunday by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.",
      "In all, Russia has occupied only an additional 1% of territory since November 2022, war-watchers agree. Most of the 20% of Ukraine that Russia controls is made up of land seized by Russian-backed fighters after 2014, and the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Assuming it can keep up even this crawl, Russia would not capture the rest of Donetsk until at least August 2027 \u201cand likely even longer,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War said. And Putin is pressuring Ukraine to hand over this territory, not because it truly is a fait accompli, but merely \u201cto save Russia significant amounts of time, effort, manpower, and resources,\" it said.",
      "On the flip side, not even Ukraine's most ardent supporters could claim that its position is easy. Could it survive the Russian advance if it wasn\u2019t coming under U.S. pressure to capitulate?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d said Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle of attrition, and both sides are paying a very high cost to defend or capture smaller and smaller areas.\u201d",
      "Pokrovsk is \u201con the verge of falling into Russian hands,\u201d said Horowitz, who follows the conflict in minutiae.",
      "That would allow Russian troops to turn their attention north to the \u201cfortress belt\u201d of Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and Kostyantynivka, a defensive line of cities that Kyiv has spent years reinforcing.",
      "Giving Donetsk to Russia would hand over these cities anyway.",
      "Ultimately, few Ukrainians believe this would be the end of the Kremlin\u2019s aggression. Rather, it would give Russia a potent foothold in the heart of the country, from which it might be able to add to its history of broken ceasefires and diplomatic promises.",
      "Ukrainian troops have for more than a year defended Pokrovsk. Now, most are pinned down in their positions, unable to move because of loitering Russian drones, and only resupplied by robotic tracked vehicles controlled remotely.",
      "Further northeast up the Donetsk front line, Russia claimed its forces had captured a string of villages, including Yampil.",
      "Meanwhile, in Zaporizhzhia, Russia has likely captured 15 villages since September, the Black Bird Group, a Finnish open-source intelligence agency, told The Kyiv Independent on Sunday.",
      "Last week, both sides traded familiar claims and denials of Russian victory in Kupiansk, in the eastern Kharkiv region, which Russian commander Sergei Kuzovlev told Putin was a \u201ckey cog in Ukraine\u2019s defenses.\u201d",
      "As of last Thursday, the general staff of the Ukrainian military said it was still under its control, deriding Russian \"propaganda\" that was \u201csolely aimed at concealing the critical losses of the Russian army.\"",
      "NBC News could not independently verify the battlefield accounts from either side.",
      "Putin has used these claims of victory to threaten Ukraine and Europe.",
      "He warned in a speech Friday that if Ukraine rejects Trump\u2019s peace efforts, \u201cthen both they and the European warmongers should understand that\u201d the Kremlin\u2019s recent victories will \u201cinevitably be repeated in other key parts of the front.\u201d",

    "summary": "As the UN Climate Change Conference was happening in Brazil, the Trump administration released proposals to open up offshore drilling and roll back protections for wetlands and endangered animals.",
    "story": [
      "As representatives from nearly 200 nations were wrapping up talks at the United Nations\u2019 COP30 climate summit this week, the United States was not only absent, but the Trump administration also introduced a series of sweeping proposals to roll back environmental protections and encourage fossil fuel drilling.",
      "The United Nations Climate Change Conference ended Friday in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m, where delegates gathered to hammer out a road map to phase out fossil fuels, boost climate action and limit global warming.",
      "For the first time in the summit\u2019s history, the U.S. \u2014 one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases \u2014 did not send a delegation. Instead, the Trump administration this week announced a plan to open up new oil drilling off the coasts of California and Florida for the first time in decades and proposed rule changes to weaken the Endangered Species Act and limit the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to protect wetlands and streams.",
      "\u201cThese rules double down on the administration\u2019s refusal to confront the climate crisis in a serious way and, in fact, move us in the opposite direction,\u201d said Jessie Ritter, associate vice president of waters and coasts for the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.",
      "The White House told NBC News on Friday that this week\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d announcements aim to \u201cfurther President Trump\u2019s American energy dominance agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is reversing government overreach, restoring energy security, and protecting American jobs by rolling back excessive, burdensome regulations and creating new opportunities to \u2018DRILL, BABY, DRILL,\u2019\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.\u201d",
      "Ritter said the new proposals signal to the world just how much the U.S. has stepped back from any meaningful climate action.",
      "\u201cI doubt that this surprises folks who have been watching in the international arena,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfortunate, given the example the U.S. sets and what our leadership, or lack thereof, emboldens other countries to do.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's announcement on Thursday that it intends to open up roughly 1.27 billion acres of coastal U.S. waters for oil drilling drew bipartisan pushback.",
      "Although the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, hailed the program as a \u201chistoric step toward unleashing our nation\u2019s vast offshore resources,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., pushed to uphold the current moratorium on drilling, which Trump extended during his first term.",
      "\u201cI have been speaking to @SecretaryBurgum and made my expectations clear that this moratorium must remain in place, and that in any plan, Florida\u2019s coasts must remain off the table for oil drilling to protect Florida\u2019s tourism, environment, and military training opportunities,\u201d Scott wrote Thursday on X, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.",
      "Across the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on X that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s idiotic proposal to sell off California\u2019s coasts to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by as our coastal economy and communities are put in danger,\u201d he said.",
      "The drilling directive came just three days after the Trump administration proposed major limits to the Clean Water Act of 1972 that would undo protections from pollution and runoff for most of the country\u2019s small streams and wetlands. The rule would narrow the definition of which bodies qualify as \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the act.",
      "If finalized, the changes would mean that the smallest share of freshwater resources would be under federal protection since the law was enacted, according to Jon Devine, who heads the water policy team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "\u201cBy EPA\u2019s own estimate, only about 19% of the country\u2019s wetlands would be protected against unregulated destruction and development if this were finalized,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands act as buffers against flooding by absorbing and storing water during extreme rainfall and other high-runoff events. As the world warms, coastal and inland flooding is expected to become more frequent and severe.",
      "\u201cMany of the places that we already have in the U.S. that are increasingly flood-prone due to climate change are going to be even more in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands and streams also feed into other bodies of water that serve as critical drinking water supplies across the country, so critics fear the policy could make drinking water unsafe in some communities.",
      "The third major environmental rollback announced this week was a set of four rules that would erode protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The proposed changes aim to make it easier to remove species classified as threatened or endangered and harder to add new protected species and their habitats to the list. The rules, if passed, would also allow the government to consider \u201ceconomic impacts\u201d in decisions to list or delist species.",
      "Taken together, Ritter said, these three proposals are consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda.",
      "\u201cThese decisions prioritize short-term gain, often for a few industries and special interests, at the expense of things that have been widely bipartisan and important issues for people for decades,\u201d Ritter said.",
      "The impacts of the changes might not all be apparent right away, she added, but the scale of the long-term consequences could be immense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly not an exaggeration that this is going to touch all Americans in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is connected, and it\u2019s hubris to think that we can have these massive negative effects on our streams and wetlands, our animals, our coastal waters, without impacts to humans.\u201d"

      "Dozens of young people wave their phone flashlights and sing along with a teen as she belts out lyrics and plays her keyboard outside a subway station.",
      "It\u2019s a scene that regularly plays out in cities around the world. But the singer in this widely shared video is now behind bars.",
      "Diana Loginova, the 18-year-old student and street musician, has emerged as an unlikely \u2014 and perhaps unwilling \u2014 voice of defiance in wartime Russia.",
      "Known by her stage name Naoko, the teen gained popularity over the summer with viral videos taken around St. Petersburg of her band Stoptime performing songs by musicians who have spoken out against Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. Inevitably, in a country where nearly all forms of dissent have been crushed, Russian authorities quickly took notice.",
      "Naoko was first detained last month for organizing a \u201cmass simultaneous gathering of citizens\u201d during a performance, which authorities said disrupted public order, and was sentenced to 13 days behind bars. She has since been rearrested twice on the same charges, as well as for petty hooliganism, and put back in prison. Her fellow band members have also served back-to-back sentences, although one has since been released.",
      "\u201cWhat is happening is what we call carousel arrests,\u201d Dmitrii Anisimov, a human rights activist and spokesperson for the OVD-Info protest monitoring group, told NBC News. \u201cTheoretically, it can continue forever,\u201d he said. In practice, it could mean months in detention, and there is legal precedent for this, he added.",
      "\u201cIt looks like Russian authorities want to use the persecution of Naoko, as with many other public cases, to intimidate others,\u201d said Anisimov.",
      "Loginova\u2019s lawyer, Maria Zyryanova, told NBC News she wouldn\u2019t discuss the case while the singer is behind bars. Her current sentence expires Sunday.",
      "Naoko\u2019s case has been extensively covered by Russian state news agencies and exiled independent media, while supporters have spread leaflets calling for her freedom.",
      "In an interview published in August, months before her imprisonment, Naoko said she was \u201cscared\u201d to be detained but felt she \u201chad to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI understand that art is now the only language \u2014 at least in Russia \u2014 through which you can express your thoughts. I\u2019ve chosen it and don\u2019t want to speak any other,\u201d she told St. Petersburg news outlet Bumaga.",
      "Others have taken up that language in Loginova\u2019s absence.",
      "On a bench near the Kiyevskaya metro station in central Moscow, musician Vasily told NBC News that Naoko\u2019s case had \u201clit a fire\u201d in him, inspiring his own street performances as a way to support the jailed singer.",
      "\u201cHer freedom was taken away for her singing,\u201d said Vasily, whose last name NBC News chose not to reveal for his safety. \u201cThat got me mad.\u201d",
      "Valentina, a professional musician from the city of Yaroslavl, about 380 miles southeast of St. Petersburg, has been singing on both the streets and social media in support of Naoko.",
      "Inspired after seeing Naoko\u2019s performances on TikTok, she has been posting videos where she performs the same songs. One gained more than 600,000 views on Instagram, which scared her because she did not want to get on authorities\u2019 radar, said Valentina, who did not want her last name revealed for fear of repercussions. \u201cWhen I saw the news about Naoko, it felt like my last hope was taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not feel sorry for myself. I just really wanted to help. I thought, \u2018Why do I berate people who keep silent and don\u2019t say anything in our country when I am also remaining silent and scared?\u2019\u201d",
      "Loginova is still a child, noted Vasily \u2014 himself only 19. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s touched people, that this little girl is not afraid to get on the streets and sing the songs of foreign agents.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s referencing the status of exiled singer Monetochka and rapper Noize MC, both slapped with the official designation often reserved for public figures whose views have set them at odds with the Kremlin.",
      "It was a song by Noize MC, who has openly spoken out against the war and Putin\u2019s regime, that Loginova performed before she first landed in jail.",
      "The rapper\u2019s lyrics that appear to have gotten her in the most trouble appear innocuous on the surface: \u201cI want to watch a ballet, let the swans dance.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a reference to the failed 1991 coup attempt against the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, during which state TV showed the \u201cSwan Lake\u201d ballet on a continuous loop. It has since come to symbolize something dangerous in Putin\u2019s Russia \u2014 change.",
      "A video of the band\u2019s cover of the song, which Loginova has said they performed rarely and not for the cameras, drew the ire of war supporters who questioned why the band was allowed to perform the songs of \u201ctraitors\u201d and whether their performances were, in fact, concealed protests.",
      "A representative for Noize MC said in an email that the rapper \u201cprefers not to give interviews or public comments regarding this case \u2014 primarily to avoid any risk of unintentionally affecting those directly involved.\u201d",
      "Monetochka, whose songs the band also performed, hailed them as \u201cheroes\u201d in a statement on social media, saying that Loginova was bringing \u201cmusic and freedom\u201d into the world rather than \u201cviolence and war.\u201d She did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov for comment on the case.",
      "Kremlin critic Boris Nadezhdin, who was barred from running against Putin in last year\u2019s election, said he had been in communication with Loginova\u2019s mom, Irina, and was fundraising to cover the band\u2019s legal costs.",
      "He has also been raising awareness on social media and said people\u2019s emotional reactions were palpable. \u201cShe is young, she is a female, and she is not at all a politician or journalist. People are used to repressions against opposition politicians and journalists, but this is a new low,\u201d said Nadezhdin.",
      "The people who came to listen to the band were also young, he added, a red flag for the Kremlin because of its predominantly older support base. \u201cSo they need to have an exemplary reprisal against some young singer,\u201d he said, \u201cso that others get fearful.\u201d",
      "While she garners sympathy at home and abroad, Loginova remains behind bars for her singing. Nadezhdin said he was not optimistic about her chances of performing again anytime soon.",
      "\u201cThey won\u2019t leave her alone quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cI am telling them to get ready for a long ride ahead.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel's military on Saturday launched airstrikes against Hamas militants in Gaza in the latest test of the ceasefire that began on Oct. 10. Health officials in Gaza reported at least 24 people killed and another 54 wounded, including children.",
      "\"The number is expected to rise as the airstrikes continue, and some of the wounded are in critical condition,\" Khalil al-Daqran, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, told NBC News.",
      "The Israeli strikes came as international momentum was building on Gaza, with the U.N. Security Council on Monday approving the U.S. blueprint to secure and govern the territory. It authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security, approves a transitional authority to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Israel has previously carried out similar waves of strikes after reported attacks on its forces. At least 33 Palestinians were killed over a 12-hour period Wednesday and Thursday, mostly women and children, health officials said.",
      "One of Saturday's strikes targeted a vehicle, killing 11 and wounding over 20 Palestinians in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood, said Rami Mhanna, managing director of Shifa Hospital, where the casualties were taken. The majority of the wounded were children, director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said. Associated Press video showed children and others inspecting the blackened vehicle, whose top was blown off.",
      "Another strike targeting a house near Al-Awda Hospital in central Gaza killed at least three people and wounded 11 others, according to the hospital. It said a strike on a house in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza killed at least seven people including a child and wounded 16 others.",
      "And a strike targeting a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed three people, including a woman, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital.",
      "\"Suddenly, I heard a powerful explosion. I looked outside and saw smoke covering the entire area. I couldn't see a thing. I covered my ears and started shouting to the others in the tent to run,\" said Khalil Abu Hatab in Deir al-Balah. \"When I looked again, I realized the upper floor of my neighbor's house was gone.\"",
      "He added: \"It's a fragile ceasefire. This is not a life we can live. There's no safe place.\"",
      "Israel's military in a statement said it launched attacks against Hamas after an \"armed terrorist\" crossed into an Israeli-held area and shot at troops in southern Gaza. It said no soldiers were hurt. The military said the person had used a road on which humanitarian aid enters the territory, and called it an \"extreme violation\" of the ceasefire.",
      "In separate statements, the military said soldiers killed five \"terrorists\" in the Rafah area, and two others after firing at four people who crossed into Israeli-held areas in northern Gaza and advanced toward soldiers in two separate incidents.",
      "The war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people and took over 250 hostage. Almost all of the hostages or their remains have been returned in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Gaza's Health Ministry says 69,733 Palestinians have been killed and 170,863 injured in Israel's retaliatory offensive. The toll has gone up during the ceasefire both from new Israeli strikes and from the recovery and identification of bodies of people killed earlier in the war.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts."

      "Ukraine and its allies welcomed progress Monday after high-stakes talks with the United States over the plan to end Russia\u2019s war, which Washington has pressured Kyiv to endorse by Thanksgiving.",
      "Meetings in Geneva produced an \u201cupdated and refined peace framework,\u201d Ukraine and the U.S. said in a joint statement that described \"meaningful progress\" from the \"highly productive\" talks.",
      "No specific details were released. European leaders expressed optimism but cautioned that \"major issues\" remained as Kyiv and its allies sought to navigate the U.S. ultimatum to accept the 28-point proposal they view as handing the Kremlin its key demands.",
      "Moscow continued to suggest it had been shut out of the discussions, and it was unclear whether any counterproposals from Ukraine would be acceptable to Russia.",
      "President Donald Trump also weighed in. \"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don\u2019t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,\" he said in a post on Truth Social early Monday.",
      "The Ukrainian delegation was on its way home to report back on the progress made, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. \u201cBased on these reports, we will determine the next steps and the timing,\u201d he added.",

      "Yet, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that \u201ca tremendous amount of progress\u201d had been made after the talks with Ukraine.",

She added that Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff and the team in Geneva worked through the 28-point peace plan with input from both the Russians and the Ukrainians over the weekend.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these points have been agreed upon. The Ukrainians have worked on language with us together, and you heard that from their delegation directly yesterday. So we feel as though we\u2019re in a very good place,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cOf course, we have to make sure that all of these points are agreed to. And then, of course, we\u2019re going to have to make sure the other party in this war, the Russians, agree to them, as well.\u201d",
      "But, while there were signs of progress, Europe remained wary as America's traditional allies scrambled to respond to the sudden emergence of a deal that could define the continent's security.",
      "\u201cThe negotiations were a step forward, but there are still major issues which remain to be resolved,\u201d Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on X.",
      "European Union leaders met to discuss the issue at a summit already taking place in Angola on Monday, as a counterproposal from major European powers circulated in the media.",
      "\u201cWhile work remains to be done, there is now a solid basis for moving forward,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement following the meeting.",
      "A German government spokesperson said Berlin saw the progress made in Geneva \u201cvery positively,\u201d according to Reuters.",
      "The plan backed by Trump amounts to Ukraine's effective capitulation, ceding key territories to Russia while reducing its military in return for no major concessions from Moscow.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin wants legal recognition for what he has \u201cstolen,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday in reference to the plan\u2019s provision for the entire eastern Donbas region, as well as Crimea, annexed in 2014, to be de facto recognized as Russian. \u201cTo break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty, and that\u2019s the main problem,\u201d he added.",
      "U.S. allies and lawmakers have raised questions over who may have been behind the plan and how much Ukraine was consulted.",

      "He was best known for songs including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"The Harder They Come,\" the title song for the movie of the same name from 1972, which featured Cliff. The film's soundtrack was a major international success and helped spread the appeal of Jamaican reggae.",
      "Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement: \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"a tremendous amount of progress\" was made Sunday after a day of talks with Ukrainian and European officials in Switzerland, however the U.S. efforts to coordinate a Ukraine peace push were clouded by concerns over the origins of the proposal.",
      "The 28-point plan suggests that Russia could be granted more territory than it holds, stipulates limits on Ukraine\u2019s army, and prevents Kyiv from ever joining NATO \u2014 concessions that amount to a near-mirror of Moscow\u2019s long-standing demands.",
      "Rubio told reporters Sunday the talks in Geneva marked \"probably the most productive day we have had on this issue.\"",
      "\"We arrived here today with one goal, and the goal was to take, you know what, 28 points, or 26 points, depending on which version as it continues to evolve, and try to narrow the ones that were open items,\" he said.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said an open dialogue with the U.S. and \u201csigns that President Trump\u2019s team is listening to us\u201d are important.",
      "\u201cIt is important to ensure that the steps to end the war are effective and that everything is workable,\u201d he said. \u201cUkraine never wanted war, and we will never be an obstacle to peace. Diplomacy has been activated, which is good. We expect that the result will be the right steps.\u201d",
      "Origins of the plan",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in an X post Sunday that European leaders were ready to work on the plan \u201cdespite some reservations,\u201d but added: \u201cBefore we start our work, it would be good to know for sure who is the author of the plan and where was it created.\u201d",
      "In a news conference Saturday, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators said Rubio had told them that the existing text being discussed was not in fact a U.S. initiative, nor the administration\u2019s position, but rather a Russian proposal given to special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "The plan \u201cwas not the administration\u2019s plan\u201d but a \u201cwish list of the Russians,\u201d Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said Rubio told them.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., asserted that \u201cnone of the information that was released on this particular proposal came back from the administration,\u201d following his call with Rubio Saturday afternoon.",
      "A State Department spokesperson later denied the senators\u2019 account, calling it \u201cblatantly false,\u201d while Rubio has asserted that the U.S. did produce the proposal.",
      "\u201cThe peace proposal was authored by the U.S. It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations,\u201d Rubio wrote on X late Saturday night. \u201cIt is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.\u201d",
      "A senior Trump administration official told NBC News previously that the plan was developed in consultation with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and Ukrainian officials.",

      "This confusion is \u201ceither by design for the Russian side, or it\u2019s a reflection of incoherence inside the administration,\u201d he added.",
      "The White House previously described the plan as \u201cthe best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,\u201d but the mixed messages from Washington \u2014 combined with nervous allies demanding clarity \u2014 have deepened doubts about what the U.S. is actually trying to achieve.",
      "Rubio on Sunday said the talks precipitated about three weeks ago with a \u201cfoundational document that we socialized and ran by both sides and with input from both sides.\u201d While he declined to go into specifics, he affirmed, \u201cthe items that remain open are not insurmountable.\u201d",
      "He said the proposal is \u201ca living breathing document\u201d that is changing everyday, and progress is contingent on Russia\u2019s approval.",
      "Thanksgiving deadline",

      "A U.S. official said Rubio, Witkoff and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d coordination meetings Sunday morning in Geneva, followed by more detailed afternoon talks aimed at ironing out the terms of a potential peace agreement.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram Sunday: \"There is currently an understanding that the American proposals may take into account a number of elements that are based on the Ukrainian vision and are critical to Ukraine's national interests.",

      "European response",

      "The Formula 1 cars blasted down the Las Vegas Strip for 50 laps at breathtaking speeds of over 215 mph, delivering thrilling wheel-to-wheel racing under the bright lights for the third consecutive year.",
      "But in a stunning twist, both Norris and fellow McLaren driver Oscar Piastri were later disqualified in the middle of the night, hours after the race finish and podium celebrations, with officials finding illegal plank wear on their cars.",
      "Norris crossed the line in second place, ahead of title rival Piastri, who finished in fourth. Their disqualification carries huge implications for the world championship fight with just two more Grand Prix races and one \u201csprint\u201d left in the season.",
      "It puts Norris just 24 points ahead of both Piastri and four-time world champion Verstappen, who are tied on points in second place. Norris now has 390 points, while Piastri and Verstappen have 366.",
      "\u201cA frustrating end to today,\u201d Norris said in a statement. \u201cWe had to do some managing towards the end of the race and now we know it was due to some issues on our car, which have unfortunately resulted in us being disqualified.\u201d",
      "Piastri called it \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cunfortunate.\u201d",
      "F1 rules require the wooden skid blocks under the cars to be at least 9 mm thick after a race in order to be deemed legal, a way to control ride height and contact with the ground. The penalty for failing to meet that standard is disqualification. It\u2019s rare, but not unheard of.",
      "McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said the breach was unintentional and apologized to Norris and Piastri \u201cfor the loss of points today, at a critical time in their Championship campaigns.\u201d He also apologized to McLaren partners and fans.",
      "\u201cWhile this outcome is extremely disappointing, we remain fully focused on the last two races of the season,\u201d Stella said.",
      "There are just two Grand Prix left in a 2025 season full of twists and turns \u2014 next weekend in Qatar and the weekend after in Abu Dhabi. The Qatar race features a shortened \u201csprint\u201d race, too, so there are a maximum of 58 points still up for grabs.",
      "\u201cThe upcoming weekends, we\u2019ll again try to win the race, and at the end of Abu Dhabi we\u2019ll see where we end up,\u201d Verstappen said of the title fight in a postrace interview ahead of the McLarens\u2019 disqualification.",
      "Norris started first but lost two positions in the opening corners after making an aggressive move to defend his lead, but ran wide on the first turn and got overtaken by Verstappen and George Russell. He eventually overtook Russell of Mercedes but couldn\u2019t get close to Verstappen, and he was forced to slow his pace toward the end due to a then-unknown issue with the car.",
      "Russell was promoted from third to second. Mercedes teammate Kimi Antonelli finished fifth but was moved up to third.",
      "\u201cI messed it up and made my life tougher into turn one,\u201d Norris said. \u201cBut even after that, we just weren\u2019t quick enough. ... I was pushing flat out and Max was still pulling away.\u201d",
      "Piastri fell a further six points behind Norris before the disqualification, but now they remain 24 points apart.",
      "An economic boost for Las Vegas",
      "Local leaders hope the race weekend will provide a much-needed economic boost to Las Vegas, which has struggled this year due to high costs and declining tourism, among other issues. Last year\u2019s Las Vegas Grand Prix delivered an economic impact of $934 million, according to one estimate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very important event. And I fully support all of our special events. We\u2019re not just the entertainment capital, we\u2019re the entertainment and sports capital,\u201d U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., who represents parts of the city, told NBC News ahead of the race. \u201cSo having a marquee event like this on the Las Vegas Strip is great, and it does a lot for our economy.\u201d",
      "F1 is looking to build on its momentum with American fans, having secured the races in Miami and Las Vegas \u2014 in addition to the long-standing Grand Prix in Austin \u2014 on the calendar for the long haul. It signed a five-year deal with Apple, which will take over the U.S. broadcast rights from ESPN starting next year.",
      "Celebrity sightings included musicians Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, actors Ben Affleck, Michael Douglas and Naomi Campbell, NBA All-Stars Magic Johnson and Jimmy Butler, and tennis player Taylor Fritz. Actor Catherine Zeta-Jones waved the checkered flag.",
      "The top three finishers were driven to the podium, which is located on the Strip at the Bellagio Fountain Club, in a pink LEGO-built Cadillac car driven by Terry Crews.",
      "Before the race, Ferrari superstar Lewis Hamilton took Beyonc\u00e9 on a hot lap around the circuit, a team spokesperson confirmed, as she was decked out in a Louis Vuitton custom racing suit. The two stars were spotted watching the race from the Ferrari garage.",
      "Also in attendance Saturday were Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel, who were given a tour of the paddock by F1 officials.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always kind of been a NASCAR fan and been learning a lot about F1 the last couple of years. And we\u2019re excited to see everybody race,\u201d Noem said, adding that she was getting a tour of the McLaren garage. Patel called Formula 1 \u201cone of the greatest sports,\u201d saying he\u2019s a McLaren fan.",
      "Rain brings chaos in qualifying",
      "The Friday qualifying session was thrown into chaos due to rain, which extracted every ounce of skill from the 20 drivers just to stay out of the barriers. The track, already known to have low grip even in dry conditions, was slippery and treacherous for most of the session.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to keep it on the track. Not crash. Not take yourself out,\u201d Norris said after taking pole position. \u201cOne day, I just hope \u2014 apart from having a two-seater F1 car \u2014 people can get that sensation of just how nerve-wracking and scary it can be at times. How unpredictable.\u201d",
      "And the Las Vegas paddock was abuzz with internal drama among several teams during the weekend.",
      "Piastri was asked about recently reposting an Instagram post that quoted F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone claiming McLaren \u201cprefers\u201d Norris because of his \u201chigh star quality\u201d and \u201cmarketing appeal.\u201d",
      "Asked about the repost, which was highlighted online by F1 content creators, Piastri told reporters it was an error.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said Friday after deleting it from his feed. \u201cI woke up this morning and saw it. So I don\u2019t know, maybe I accidentally did it. Obviously, it was not intentional. But yeah, I didn\u2019t know what had happened.\u201d",
      "Instagram has one-click reposts \u2014 unlike X, which requires users to click twice to confirm \u2014 making it easy to erroneously repost something while scrolling. Still, it added to a drama in which the Australian driver\u2019s fans have theorized that the British team favors his British teammate, a claim that McLaren firmly denies.",
      "Ferrari\u2019s two drivers downplayed recent comments by Ferrari chairperson John Elkann, who said they should \u201ctalk less and focus on driving\u201d \u2014 remarks slammed by critics as a gratuitous dig against Charles Leclerc and Hamilton after Ferrari\u2019s decision to build a new car for 2025 (rather than upgrade last year\u2019s version) backfired and led to a winless season so far.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always willing to do less media,\u201d Hamilton quipped.",
      "The seven-time world champion told reporters it\u2019s \u201cnot really\u201d possible to focus any more on driving than he already does. \u201cI wake up thinking about it. And I go to sleep thinking about it. And I think about it while I\u2019m sleeping,\u201d Hamilton said.",
      "Leclerc said the comment was a product of Elkann\u2019s ambition to maximize the team\u2019s potential. \u201cHe loves Ferrari. I love Ferrari. We all love Ferrari,\u201d Leclerc said. \u201cWhen he called me, he told me what were the intentions of these words, and that was very clear. It was a positive message, trying to be positive.\u201d",
      "Ferrari currently sits fourth in a close battle for second in the team championship, behind Mercedes and Red Bull. While the driver\u2019s title carries more glory, the constructors\u2019 championship is the one that awards cash prizes. Ferrari finished runner-up to McLaren last year in a close battle.",
      "While Hamilton said he takes no positives regarding his comeback from last place to a points finish, he enjoys racing in Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cI love coming to Vegas,\u201d he told reporters after the race. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really great city. Always get a great welcome here. This is the biggest crowd I think we\u2019ve seen, even though it\u2019s quite cold.\u201d",
      "And the activities of the weekend have evolved over the three years as F1 seeks a better balance between sport and show.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s certainly better than it was a few years ago. I think that was a bit too much for everyone,\u201d Norris said. \u201cMay as well be in Cirque du Soleil with what we were doing back then.\u201d"

      "The 18-carat Jules Jurgensen watch, engraved and given to Straus for his 43rd birthday in 1888 \u2014 the same year he became a partner in New York\u2019s iconic department store Macy\u2019s \u2014 was recovered from his body after the ship sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912.",

      "Isidor Straus, born in 1845 into a Jewish family in Otterberg, Bavaria, emigrated to the United States in 1854. The couple was traveling home from a trip when they boarded the doomed Titanic in Southampton, heading for New York."

      "\u201cDuring a school outing, the group had stopped along a trail near the community where a single grizzly bear emerged from the forest and attacked,\u201d he said. \u201cTeachers put themselves in harm\u2019s way to protect the children. They definitely avoided worse injuries.\u201d",
      "Authorities were collecting evidence from the attack site to help identify and capture the bear, Van Damme said. In the meantime, residents and visitors in the area, known for outdoor activities, were told to stay indoors.",
      "\"I really need to stress how dangerous this situation is with this bear at large,\" Van Damme said, adding later during the news conference: \"I have not seen an attack like this \u2014 with a large group of people.\"",
      "He added that an incident involving more than a dozen people is \"extremely rare.\"",
      "The Nuxalk Nation of Indigenous people in the region asked everyone in the area to \"avoid all trails.\"",
      "Residents of the 4 Mile area in Bella Coola were told to remain indoors on Saturday, and potential visitors were advised to stay away. Additional conservation officers joined the search alongside a Royal Canadian Mounted Police helicopter crew with heat imaging technology, the Conservation Officer Service said in a statement on Saturday.",
      "The board and administration of Acwsalcta School, an independent institution run by the Nuxalk Nation in Bella Coola, said in a statement that school would remain closed Monday and that counseling would be available.",
      "Parent Veronica Schooner told The Associated Press that, among the many who tried to halt the attack, one teacher \u201cgot the whole brunt of it\u201d and was transported to a hospital.",
      "Schooner said her 10-year-old son Alvarez was in the class of fourth and fifth graders attacked by the bear and was close enough that \u201che even felt its fur.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,\u201d Schooner said.",
      "She added that some children were hit with the bear spray.",
      "The British Columbia Assembly of First Nations, an umbrella organization for the 204 First Nations of Indigenous people in the province, said the attack should inspire reconsideration of measures to prevent such incidents.",
      "\"This event raises important questions about safety protocols, community preparedness and the respect for First Nations\u2019 knowledge in managing wildlife,\" the organization said in a statement that also expressed solidarity with the Nuxalk Nation.",
      "The B.C. Wildlife Federation, a nonprofit that works toward environmental preservation, said Friday that a 2017 province ban on hunting grizzlies correlates to a rise in such attacks because the bears, plentiful in Bella Coola, have been freer to learn behavior dangerous to humans.",
      "Since the prohibition started, the federation said in a statement  Friday, the number of bear reports to the British Columbia Conservation Officer Service has doubled.",
      "\u201cWith no hunting pressure, grizzlies and humans will increasingly occupy the same spaces with inevitable consequences,\u201d BC Wildlife Federation Executive Director Jesse Zeman said.",
      "While the federation expressed hope the incident would lead to reconsideration of the hunting ban, Davidson, the province's parks minister, said it was too soon.",
      "\"This is an ongoing live situation where the bear is still at large and the community doesn't feel safe,\" she said. \"No considerations just yet.\"",
      "At the same time, Davidson said, her ministry hopes the families of those attacked experience \"healing and comfort in the coming days.\""

      "A U.S.-led peace plan that mirrors several key Russian demands has sent ripples across Europe, with leaders voicing concerns that it could leave Ukraine vulnerable and calling for changes to the proposals.",
      "European leaders and key allies met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Africa and said in a joint statement that the plan requires additional work, adding that they are \u201cconcerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\u201d",
      "The statement was signed by leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway, as well as the European Union Commission and the E.U. Council. Japan\u2019s and Canada\u2019s leaders also signed on to the statement, which warns that \u201cborders must not be changed by force.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has set Thanksgiving as the deadline for Ukraine to agree to the 28-point framework, which suggests that Russia could be granted more territory than it holds and would place limits on Ukraine\u2019s army and prevent Kyiv from ever joining NATO \u2014 Moscow\u2019s long-sought demands.",
      "The U.S. proposals do include a security guarantee modeled on NATO\u2019s Article 5, which would commit the U.S. and European allies to treat a future attack on Ukraine as an attack on the entire trans-Atlantic community, according to a U.S. official, though there are few specifics on what that would entail.",
      "Top Ukrainian and U.S. officials will meet in Switzerland to discuss \u201cpossible parameters of a future peace,\u201d Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, wrote on Telegram Saturday. Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office said Saturday that the delegation has been confirmed for the talks, which \u201cwill take place in the coming days.\u201d",
      "The White House has described the plan as \u201cthe best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,\u201d saying the proposals were crafted with input from Russia and Ukraine.",
      "However, analysts say the plan could amount to a dangerous capitulation for Ukraine, which has previously rejected plans that would require recognizing Russia\u2019s illegal annexations of the entire eastern Donetsk region and Crimea.",
      "\u201cEven if parts of this plan were to be shoved down Ukraine\u2019s throat, it would be the end of Ukraine as we know it. It\u2019s a real capitulation,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, who was in Johannesburg, told NBC News by phone.",
      "The U.S. was facilitating a \u201cpotentially disastrous surrender for Ukraine,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cAnd now we will see yet another panicked scramble by European leaders to head off an outcome that would be disastrous for their own security,\u201d he said, adding that the European response toward \u201crepeated disastrous peace plans has been in words, not action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere should be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said Friday in a post on X, adding European leaders will also meet in Angola next week.",
      "Ukraine must have a \u201cdecisive voice in peace talks,\u201d Polish President Karol Nawrocki said late Friday on X. \u201cThe price of peace cannot in any way be the achievement of strategic goals by the aggressor, and the aggressor was and remains the Russian Federation,\u201d he added.",
      "As European leaders mulled over the plan on the G20 summit\u2019s sidelines, notably absent was Trump, who is boycotting the event over his unfounded claims that South Africa\u2019s white minority is subject to hate crimes and land grabs.",
      "While Trump initially said Vice President JD Vance would attend, he later said there would be no U.S. delegation taking part. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has an International Criminal Court warrant calling for his arrest, is also not attending.",
      "How much Europe will actually be able to influence the plan without U.S. involvement remains an open question, and one with implications for both Ukraine\u2019s borders and peace for the broader continent.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t influence this,\u201d said Bociurkiw. \u201cIt makes NATO and Europe look weak, and Putin will go on and on to cause more disruptions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a speed train and you have Putin and Trump on it, and then you have Zelenskyy on the departure platform and Europe stuck at the check-in counter,\u201d he added.",
      "Giles said the military aspects of the peace plan leave Ukraine effectively defenseless against a future Russian attack.",
      "\u201cAnd since Ukraine forms the front line of the defense of Europe, this is a potentially disastrous outcome for the continent as a whole,\u201d Giles said.",
      "Lawmakers in Ukraine aren\u2019t particularly happy with the plan either, with Victoria Podgorna from Zelenskyy\u2019s political party saying it was giving Russia \u201camnesty for launching a brutal war.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Friday he had spoken with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his counterparts in Germany and France, adding that he would also talk to Washington to ensure Kyiv\u2019s \u201cprincipled stances are taken into account.\u201d",
      "\u201cUkraine may now face a very difficult choice, either losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, either the difficult 28 points, or a very difficult winter,\u201d Zelenskyy said, warning his country of a \u201cvery difficult, eventful\u201d week ahead.",
      "His warning also came as Ukraine suffers setbacks on the battlefield and Zelenskyy tries to contain the fallout from a $100 million corruption scandal implicating his top officials.",
      "On Saturday, the Russian defense ministry said it had captured two additional villages in eastern Ukraine, one in the Donetsk region and another in Zaporizhzhia.",
      "Russia's gains, both on the battlefield and in the proposed plan, have drawn a positive response from the Kremlin, where Putin has said it could \u201cform the basis of a final peace settlement,\u201d though adding it was not \u201csubstantively\u201d discussed with Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, two people were killed in Russia\u2019s southern city of Syzran in a Ukrainian strike on energy facilities, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Fedorishchev, said Saturday on Russia\u2019s state-backed Max messenger app."

      "TOKYO \u2014 As Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi has broken new ground in a country that struggles with gender equality. But she has quickly run up against a tradition that may be immovable.",
      "Trophies for sumo wrestling, Japan\u2019s national sport, are sometimes presented by the country\u2019s top leader \u2014 most recently in January, when Shigeru Ishiba, the prime minister at the time, awarded the winner\u2019s trophy at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo.",
      "But awkward questions arose ahead of the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament, which concludes Sunday in the Japanese city of Fukuoka. Takaichi is prohibited from entering the ring according to the rules of sumo, which consider women impure.",
      "Takaichi will have a chance to sidestep the issue as the Japanese leader is expected to attend the G20 summit in South Africa this weekend amid a diplomatic spat with China.",
      "But the dilemma could resurface during the New Year\u2019s tournament in Tokyo.",
      "In Japan, sumo is not just a sport but a 1,500-year-old tradition that is held sacred in the nation of over 100 million people. It has deep roots in Shinto, Japan\u2019s Indigenous religion.",
      "Experts suggested Takaichi, a hard-line conservative elected last month whose policies are not seen as particularly pro-women, is likely to avoid the issue altogether so as not to challenge tradition, and send another high-ranking government official instead.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to upset her supporters or conservatives,\u201d said Hiromi Murakami, an expert on Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to even see a discussion around the topic,\u201d she said.",
      "Minoru Kihara, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, said last week that Takaichi \u201cholds the view that Japan\u2019s sumo culture is a traditional art form that should be cherished.\u201d",
      "She \u201cintends to respect the traditions of sumo culture,\u201d he later told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "Reached for comment this week, the Japan Sumo Association said it had not received any request from Takaichi\u2019s office regarding her involvement. The association told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper this month, \u201cWe believe it is our mission to pass down the traditional culture of sumo.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time there have been questions as to whether a high-ranking female official would be allowed to enter the sumo ring, also known as the dohyo.",
      "In 1990, Mayumi Moriyama became Japan\u2019s first female chief Cabinet secretary, who often represents the government at sumo trophy ceremonies. The sumo association did not allow her to do so.",
      "The association rejected another request in 2000 by Japan\u2019s first female governor, Fusae Ohta, to enter the sumo ring at a tournament in the city of Osaka. She ultimately presented the trophy on a walkway next to the dohyo.",
      "In 2018, a female mayor, Tomoko Nakagawa of the city of Takarazuka, was denied a request to make a speech in the ring. That same year, the association apologized after two women were ordered out of the ring when they rushed to the aid of a mayor who had collapsed inside it.",
      "Such incidents underscore the challenges that continue to face women in Japan, which ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report.",
      "Sumo wrestling has also proved popular on the rare occasion a competition is held outside Japan. Last month, tickets sold out for the Grand Sumo Tournament at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, which hosted the event for the first time in 34 years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite interesting that they went to the U.K.,\u201d Murakami said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a female political leader who wants to give the trophy, what would happen then?\u201d",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Jay Ganglani from Hong Kong."

      "The first Group of 20 summit to be held in Africa opened on Saturday with an ambitious agenda to make progress on solving some of the long-standing problems that have afflicted the world's poorest nations.",
      "Leaders and top government officials from the richest and leading emerging economies came together at an exhibition center near the famous Soweto township in South Africa, once home to Nelson Mandela, to try and find some consensus on the priorities set out by the host country.",
      "Many of South Africa's priorities for the group, especially a focus on climate change and its impact on developing countries, have met resistance from the United States, which is boycotting the talks.",
      "As he opened the summit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his speech that \"consensus has emerged\" and appeared to indicate that a declaration would be adopted in the absence of the U.S. and despite its opposition.",
      "South Africa's agenda",
      "South Africa, which gets to set the agenda as the country holding the rotating presidency, wants leaders to agree to more help for poor countries to recover from climate-related disasters, reduce their foreign debt burdens, transition to green energy sources and harness their own critical mineral wealth \u2014 all in an attempt to counter widening global inequality.",
      "\"We'll see,\" United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnio Guterres said on whether the G20 could prioritize developing world countries and make meaningful reforms. \"But I think South Africa has done its part in putting those things clearly upon the table.\"",
      "The two-day summit will take place without the world's biggest economy after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. boycott of the summit over his claims that South Africa is pursuing racist anti-white policies and persecuting its Afrikaner white minority.",
      "The Trump administration has also made clear its opposition to South Africa's G20 agenda from the start of the year, when South Africa began hosting G20 meetings. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipped a G20 foreign ministers meeting in February, calling the agenda all about diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change",
      "Rubio said he would not waste American taxpayers' money on that.",
      "Diplomatic rift",
      "The monthslong diplomatic rift between the U.S. and South Africa deepened in the buildup to the main summit this weekend, but while Trump's boycott dominated the pre-talks discussions in Johannesburg and threatened to undercut the agenda, some of the leaders were eager to move on.",
      "\"I do regret it,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said of Trump's absence, \"but it should not block us. Our duty is to be present, engage and work all together because we have so many challenges.\"",
      "The G20 is actually a group of 21 members that includes 19 nations, the European Union and the African Union.",
      "The bloc was formed in 1999 as a bridge between rich and poor nations to confront global financial crises. While it often operates in the shadow of the Group of Seven richest democracies, G20 members together represent around 85% of the world's economy, 75% of international trade and more than half the global population.",
      "But it works on consensus rather than any binding resolutions, and that is often hard to come by with the different interests of members like the U.S., Russia, China, India, Japan, the Western European nations France, Germany and the U.K., and others like Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.",
      "Guterres cautioned that rich nations have often failed to make the concessions required to strike effective climate or global financial reform agreements.",
      "Doubts over a declaration",
      "G20 summits traditionally end with a leaders' declaration, which details any broad agreement reached by the members, but even that was proving hard to come by in Johannesburg.",
      "South Africa said the U.S. was exerting pressure on it not to issue any leaders' declaration in the absence of the U.S. and instead tone down the final document to a unilateral statement from the host country.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa responded to that by saying \"we will not be bullied\" and has promised a declaration from all members present at the close of the summit on Sunday, with or without U.S. input.",
      "Even so, the direction of the G20 bloc is likely to change sharply given that the U.S. takes over the rotating presidency from South Africa at the end of this summit, as the Trump administration has derided the focus on climate change and inequality. Trump has said the U.S. will stage next year's summit at his golf club in Doral, Florida.",
      "The only role the U.S. will play at this summit, the White House said, will be when a representative from the United States Embassy in South Africa attends the formal handover ceremony at the end to accept the G20 presidency.",
      "South Africa said it's an insult for Ramaphosa to hand over to what it considers to be a junior diplomatic official.",
      "\"We have communicated to the American government that the president will not be handing over to a junior official of the embassy,\" South African Foreign Ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri told The Associated Press. \"And so, as a result, we don't anticipate that there'll be any form of handover here (at the summit).\""

      "The U.S. plan \u201clooks less like a genuine peace framework and more like a set of proposals that align predominantly with the interests of the Russian Federation,\u201d Victoria Podgorna, a lawmaker with  Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People political party, said in an interview. \u201cThe question is: Why these proposals seem to be based almost entirely on Russia\u2019s demands?\u201d",
      "Jessica Berlin, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, characterized the proposals as \u201cessentially the Kremlin\u2019s wish list\u201d that had been \u201camateurishly formulated.\u201d It would show that \u201cRussia can invade a sovereign nation\u201d and \u201cwalk away victorious with territorial gains, military concessions and sanctions relief,\u201d she added.",
      "Not everyone on the continent shares such a grim assessment.",
      "The plan says Ukraine would \u201creceive reliable security guarantees,\u201d a central European demand in any deal, and that if Russia invades again, there would be \u201ca decisive coordinated military response.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a starting point for something that could stop the killing, it has some promise,\u201d Mark Galeotti, the British-based director of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence, posted on X, acknowledging this would \u201cbe an unpopular opinion.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what is in the latest plan:",
      "Territorial concessions",
      "The most contentious point in the draft is that \u201cCrimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States.\u201d"

      "Convicted Israeli spy Jonathan J. Pollard downplayed the controversy around his private meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, telling NBC News the visit was \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t done surreptitiously.\u201d",
      "The \u201cmain point\u201d of the meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in July, Pollard said, was to \u201cthank\u201d the ambassador for \u201chis efforts on my behalf during my incarceration.\u201d",
      "Pollard, a former American intelligence analyst, spent 30 years in prison on espionage charges after being found to have passed critical security documents to Israeli intelligence in the 1980s. Israel made Pollard a citizen during his lengthy prison term, and he moved there in 2020, five years after his release on probation.",
      "During Pollard\u2019s detention, Huckabee was among several pro-Israeli politicians who advocated for his release, arguing that the sentence was too severe for someone who had been spying for an ally.",
      "Pollard described his meeting as more of a social call and insisted the two didn\u2019t discuss politics or Gaza. But the meeting comes amid a growing list of episodes in which the ambassador, a fierce champion of Israel, has appeared to deviate from official White House policy as the Trump administration deepens its involvement in Middle East diplomacy and peacekeeping.",
      "The New York Times first revealed the meeting Thursday. In a statement, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem said the article \u201cis filled with inaccuracies\u201d and said Huckabee \u201chas meetings each day with numerous people and as a matter of general policy we don\u2019t comment as to the content of conversations.\u201d",
      "The embassy offered no further information and declined to offer a comment from the ambassador himself.",
      "\u201cThe White House was not aware of that meeting but the president stands by our ambassador,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "Pollard said the meeting was \u201ca simple story\u201d that \u201cgot far more complicated than it deserved.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News that he had arranged the visit simply by phoning up the ambassador\u2019s office. \u201cHe had nothing to hide and I had nothing to hide,\" Pollard said, adding that it was an \u201cintensely personal visit to thank him\u201d for his work while he was incarcerated.",
      "But there were questions across the political spectrum for Huckabee over his decision to meet the notorious spy, whose long imprisonment drove a wedge between the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a post on X that Huckabee should not have met with \u201ca convicted traitor,\u201d while former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Huckabee\u2019s conduct was \u201cshocking behavior from a United States ambassador.\u201d",
      "But this isn\u2019t the first time that Huckabee, a two-time presidential candidate, former governor of Arkansas and self-described Christian Zionist, has ruffled feathers on policy.",
      "The ambassador told Israeli media in early September that the U.S. would not stop Israel from annexing the occupied West Bank. The White House and several senior administration officials have since made it clear that the U.S. would oppose such a move.",
      "Earlier this year, he told the Bloomberg news agency that the U.S. was no longer pursuing the goal of Palestinian statehood, which has long stood as a central feature of American diplomacy in the Middle East. A U.S.-backed plan for Gaza approved by the United Nations earlier this month restated support for a future \u201ccredible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d",
      "Huckabee has regularly used the religiously loaded term \u201cJudea and Samaria\u201d to refer to the West Bank, the mostly Palestinian enclave that Israel has occupied since 1967. In 2008, he said that \u201cthere is no such thing as a Palestinian\u201d and that Palestinian nationhood is just a \u201cpolitical tool to try and force land away from Israel.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Sunday before news of the Pollard meeting broke, he downplayed talk of a rift with the White House and struck a decidedly more obedient tone.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t get to make the policy. I simply carry it out as an ambassador,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cI\u2019ve had some very strong opinions on it, but my job here is not to be the chemist making the medicine. My job is simply to be the pharmacist and dispense it.\u201d"
