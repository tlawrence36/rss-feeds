      "The trial for Nathan Chasing Horse, the former actor in \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d begins Tuesday with jury selection",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The jury trial for Nathan Chasing Horse, the former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor accused of sexually abusing Indigenous women and girls, is expected to begin Tuesday in Las Vegas.",
      "Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of his victims over two decades. Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 charges, including sexual assault, sexual assault with a minor, first degree kidnapping of a minor and the use of a minor in producing pornography.",
      "The case sent shock waves across Indian Country when he was arrested and indicted in early 2023. There were many setbacks and delays, but the case finally proceeded to trial after prosecutors added allegations that he filmed himself having sex with a child.",
      "Best known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "After starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse proclaimed himself to be a Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies.",
      "Prosecutors claim Chasing Horse led a cult called The Circle, and his followers believed he could speak with spirits. His victims went to him for medical help, according to a court transcript from a grand jury hearing.",
      "One victim was 14 years old when she approached him hoping he would heal her mother, who was diagnosed with cancer. Chasing Horse previously had treated the victim\u2019s breathing issues and her mother\u2019s spider bite, according to a court transcript. He allegedly told her the spirits wanted her to give up her virginity in exchange for her mother\u2019s health. He allegedly had sex with her and said her mother would die if she told anyone, according to the victim\u2019s testimony to the grand jury.",
      "The original indictment was dismissed in 2024 after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled prosecutors abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony.",

      "The high court, specifying that the dismissal had nothing to do with his innocence or guilt, left open the possibility of charges being refiled. In October 2024, the charges were refiled with new allegations that he recorded himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14.",
      "Prosecutors have said the recordings, made in 2010 or 2011, were found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.",
      "Jury selection will begin Tuesday. The trial is expected to last four weeks, and prosecutors plan to call 18 witnesses. A week before the trial, Chasing Horse attempted to fire his private defense attorney, saying his lawyer hadn't come to visit him. Judge Jessica Peterson removed Chasing Horse from the courtroom when he tried to interrupt her, and she denied his request.",
      "This case is a reminder that violence also occurs within Native communities and is not just something committed by outsiders, said Crystal Lee, CEO and founder of the organization United Natives, which offers services to victims of sexual abuse.",
      "Chasing Horse\u2019s trial requires hard conversations about Native perpetrators, she said.",
      "\u201cHow do we hold them accountable?\u201d she said. \u201cHow do we start these tough conversations?\u201d",

      "The weekend newscast averaged 827,000 viewers per show, roughly 1 million less than what \u201cNewsHour\u201d gets during the week, according to the Nielsen company.",
      "The Republican-controlled Congress, responding to President Donald Trump's wishes, eliminated funding for PBS and NPR in July. The president has complained about news programming on public broadcasting being biased against conservatives.",
      "During Sunday's finale, highlights aired by PBS illustrated important news stories that broke over weekends \u2014 Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023, the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in summer 2024, and Joe Biden's exit from the presidential race on a Sunday a few weeks later.",
      "Asked if the weekend newscasts could return if a future government restores funding to PBS, Just said, \u201cI never say never, but this is not a temporary decision.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Nikki Glaser went hard then eased up in her monologue to open Sunday's Golden Globes.",
      "In her earliest jokes she suggested stars in the room might be in the Epstein Files and took a shot at CBS, the network airing the show.",
      "\u201cThere are so many A-listers, and by A-listers, I do mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted,\" she said. \u201cAnd the Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department.\"",

      "\u201cThe award for most editing goes to CBS News,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, CBS News: America\u2019s newest place to see BS news.\u201d",
      "She didn't bring up Venezuela, a subject she told The Associated Press this week she was considering mentioning, but worried it would already be old news in the chaotic moment. And there was no mention of ICE.",
      "Glaser also told the AP she was struggling to find a joke about Julia Roberts, saying she was so beloved and respected that nothing Glaser tried with her comedy club test audiences was landing.",
      "She found a way to come at it sideways.",
      "\u201cJust like the podcasters nominated tonight, I should not be allowed to be this close to Julia Roberts,\u201d she said, and got the big laugh she was looking for.",
      "It was Glaser's second time hosting the show. She was quickly rehired after getting strong reviews in her first outing last year. She was hired the first time after the ruthless roast she gave the attendees of the Netflix roast of Tom Brady. She's been kinder on the Globes, but her jokes still had some bite.",
      "She made the obligatory joke about Leonardo DiCaprio dating young women.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve worked with every great director. You\u2019ve won three Golden Globes and an Oscar,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the most impressive thing is that you were able to accomplish all of that before your girlfriend turned 30.\u201d",
      "She then went meta and apologized for being so obvious.",

    "story": [
      "References to President Donald Trump\u2019s two impeachments have been removed from his photo portrait display at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's photo portrait display at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has had references to his two impeachments removed, the latest apparent change at the collection of museums he has accused of bias as he asserts his influence over how official presentations document U.S. history.",
      "The wall text, which summarized Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \u201cAmerican Presidents\u201d exhibition. The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Trump taken during his first term. Now, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though the text was available online. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen Sunday, did not include any extended text.",
      "The White House did not say whether it sought any changes. Nor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions. But Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4. The Republican administration said the effort would \u201censure alignment with the president\u2019s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\u201d",
      "Trump's original \u201cportrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines. That section concludes: \u201cImpeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\u201d",
      "Then the text continues: \u201cAfter losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\u201d",
      "Asked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Trump's \u201cunmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\u201d",
      "The portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Trump is the 45th and 47th president. Similar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries such as what had been part of Trump's display.",
      "Sitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d won best film, comedy, supporting female actor for Teyana Taylor and best director and best screenplay for Anderson. He became just the second filmmaker to sweep director, screenplay and film, as a producer, at the Globes. Only Oliver Stone, for \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d managed the same feat.",
      "In an awards ceremony that went almost entirely as expected, the night's final award was the most surprising. While \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d has been the clear front-runner this awards season, most have pegged Ryan Coogler's Jim Crow-era vampire thriller as its closest competition.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Bob Weir, the guitarist and singer who as an essential member of the Grateful Dead helped found the sound of the San Francisco counterculture of the 1960s and kept it alive through decades of endless tours and marathon jams, has died. He was 78.",
      "Weir\u2019s death was announced Saturday in a statement on his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cIt is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\u201d a statement on his Instagram posted Saturday said. \u201cHe transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\u201d",
      "Weir joined the Grateful Dead \u2014 originally the Warlocks \u2014 in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He would spend the next 30 years playing on endless tours with the Grateful Dead alongside fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia, who died in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \u201cSugar Magnolia,\u201d \u201cOne More Saturday Night\u201d and \u201cMexicali Blues.\u201d",
      "After Garcia\u2019s death, he would be the Dead's most recognizable face. In the decades since, he kept playing with other projects that kept alive the band's music and legendary fan base, including Dead & Company.",
      "\u201cFor over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\u201d the Instagram statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music.\u201d",
      "Weir\u2019s death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \u201cPigpen\u201d McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concerts for the Grateful Dead\u2019s 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, drawing some 60,000 fans a day for three days.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but he had a long beard like Garcia\u2019s in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",

      "K-pop is an inextricable force in global pop culture",
      "NEW YORK -- Two things can be true at once. K-pop is an inextricable force in global pop culture, and it has long been undercelebrated at institutions like the Grammys \u2014 where K-pop artists have performed but have never taken home a trophy.",
      "That could change at next month's 2026 Grammy Awards ceremony. Songs released by K-pop artists \u2014 or K-pop-adjacent artists, more on that later \u2014 have received nominations in the big four categories for the first time. Ros\u00e9, perhaps best known as one-fourth of the juggernaut girl group Blackpink, is the first K-pop artist to ever receive a nomination in the record of the year field for \u201cAPT.,\u201d her megahit with Grammys' favorite Bruno Mars.",
      "The song of the year category also features K-pop nominees for the first time. \u201cAPT.\u201d will go head-to-head with the fictional girl group HUNTR/X's \u201cGolden,\u201d performed by Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami from the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack.",
      "And the girl group Katseye, the brain child of HYBE \u2014 the entertainment company behind K-pop sensation BTS and countless other international acts \u2014 fashioned in the image of the K-pop idol system, has been nominated for best new artist.",
      "It depends on who you ask.",
      "Areum Jeong, assistant professor of Korean Studies at Arizona State University and author of \u201cK-pop Fandom: Performing Deokhu from the 1990s to Today\u201d says the majority of these nominations strike her more as \u201ca de-territorialized, hybrid idea of K-pop,\u201d instead of a recognition of K-pop.",
      "While Ros\u00e9 \u201cwas recruited and trained under the K-pop system, and while \u2018APT.\u2019 does contain some motifs from the Korean drinking game,\u201d Jeong says, \u201cthe song does not feel like a localized K-pop production. \u2026 Same with Katseye, who was trained and produced under HYBE but marketed more toward Western fans and listeners.\u201d",
      "Jeong says that both \u201cAPT.\u201d and Katseye's \u201cGabriela\u201d \u2014 both of which will go head-to-head with \u201cGolden\u201d in the pop duo/group performance category \u2014 \u201cseem less K-pop than other K-pop songs that could have been nominated over the years.\u201d",
      "She argues the same is true for the music of \u201cKpop Demon Hunters.\u201d \u201cIt is very similar to \u2018APT.\u2019 in that it takes inspiration and motif from Korean culture,\u201d where \u201cK-pop serves as an idea, a jumping-off point, or a motif, creating alternatives or new possibilities.\u201d",
      "Mathieu Berbiguier, a visiting assistant professor in Korean Studies at Carnegie Mellon University, points out that these nominations differ from past K-pop Grammy nominations because \u201cGolden,\u201d \u201cAPT.\u201d and Katseye all feature \u201ca mainstream popular music factor.\u201d",
      "That's the connection of a massive popular Netflix film (\u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d), a collaboration with Bruno Mars (\u201cAPT.\u201d), and Katseye's international membership and Netflix series (\u201cPop Star Academy: Katseye\u201d), respectively.",
      "\u201cIt tells you that K-pop is not considered as something niche anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, when we think about pop music in general, we also think of K-pop as part of it.\u201d",
      "Bernie Cho, industry expert and president of the South Korean agency, the DFSB Kollective, agrees that there is an international, mainstream appeal to the nominees.",
      "\u201cAll the nominees represent a sort of post-idol K-pop, in the sense that Ros\u00e9, the three ladies of HUNTR/X and Katseye represent the globalized version of K-pop, where the \u2018K\u2019 is very much there, but some people might argue it\u2019s silent. The songs are not necessarily for Korea, by Korea, from Korea, just kind of beyond Korea,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration and testament to how diverse and dynamic K-pop has become.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the Recording Academy has snubbed K-pop acts that have set record-breaking standards, such as BTS,Seventeen and Stray Kids,\u201d argues Jeong. \u201cI think one of the main reasons is that the Western world is still so resistant to non-English lyrics.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt does not surprise me that \u2018APT.\u2019 and Katseye\u2019s music, which mainly contain English lyrics and seem less K-pop, were nominated,\u201d she continues.",

Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says many critics and industry voices found 2025 to be a lackluster year for new pop music in the U.S. \u2014 a fact that was all but confirmed in Luminate's 2025 Mid-Year Report, which found that streams of new music had slowed compared to the year prior, potentially due to a dearth of megahits dominating the charts.",
      "\u201cYes, it's a big moment for K-pop, but it is so overdue, these recognitions are more of a sign of how poorly the music industry in the U.S. did this year that we're looking externally,\u201d she says.",
      "She argues that acknowledgment of Korean entertainment from U.S. entertainment industries is more symbolic of U.S. cultural dominance slipping than \u201cK-pop being really good, because K-pop has been really good for a really long time,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is all recognition of just global storytelling improvement, global taste-making improvement.\u201d",

      "\u201cYes and no,\u201d offers Herman. For her, it depends on an evolving and fluid definition of K-pop. After all, HUNTR/X is a fictional girl group from an animated film that did not debut through the K-pop music industry system. Would a victory for their song \u201cGolden\u201d mean a victory of K-pop? That's a matter of opinion.",

      "Harvey Weinstein is returning to a New York court",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein returns to court Thursday, seeking to get his latest sex crime conviction thrown out because anger and apprehensions flared among jurors during deliberations last spring.",
      "It's the latest convoluted turn in the former Hollywood honcho's path through the criminal justice system. His landmark #MeToo-era case has spanned seven years, trials in two states, a reversal in one and a retrial that came to a messy end in New York last year. Weinstein was convicted of forcing oral sex on one woman, acquitted of forcibly performing oral sex on another, and the jury didn't decide on a rape charge involving a third woman \u2014 a charge prosecutors vowed to retry yet again.",
      "Weinstein, 73, denies all the charges. They were one outgrowth of a stack of sexual harassment and sex assault allegations against him that emerged publicly in 2017 and ensuing years, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Early on, Weinstein apologized for \u201cthe way I've behaved with colleagues in the past,\u201d while also denying that he ever had non-consensual sex.",
      "At trial, Weinstein's lawyers argued that the women willingly accepted his advances in hopes of getting work in various capacities in show business, then falsely accused him to net settlement funds and attention.",
      "The split verdict last June came after multiple jurors took the unusual step of asking to brief the judge on behind-the-scenes tensions.",
      "In a series of exchanges partly in open court, one juror complained that others were \u201cshunning\u201d one of the panel members; the foreperson alluded to jurors \u201cpushing people\u201d verbally and talking about Weinstein's \u201cpast\u201d in a way the juror thought improper; yet a third juror opined that discussions were \u201cgoing well.\u201d The foreperson later came forward again to complain to the judge about being pressured to change his mind, then said he feared for his safety because a fellow panelist had said he would \u201csee me outside.\u201d The foreperson eventually refused to continue deliberating.",
      "In court, Judge Curtis Farber cited the secrecy of ongoing deliberations and reminded jurors not to disclose \u201cthe content or tenor\u201d of them. Since the trial, Weinstein's lawyers have talked with the first juror who openly complained and with another who didn't.",
      "In sworn statements, the two said they didn't believe Weinstein was guilty, but had given in because of other jurors' verbal aggression.",

      "Weinstein's lawyers contend the tensions amounted to threats that poisoned the process, and that the judge didn't look into them enough before denying the defense's repeated requests for a mistrial. Weinstein's attorneys are asking him to discard the conviction or, at least, conduct a hearing about the jury strains.",
      "Prosecutors maintain that the judge was presented with claims about \u201cscattered instances of contentious interactions\u201d and handled them appropriately. Jurors' later sworn statements are belied, prosecutors say, by other comments from one of the same jury members. He told the media right after the trial that there \u201cwas just high tension\u201d in the group.",
      "Prosecutors also said the foreperson\u2019s concerns about discussions of Weinstein\u2019s past were vague and the topic wasn\u2019t entirely off-limits. Testimony covered, for example, 2017 media reports about decades of sexual harassment allegations against him.",
      "The judge is expected to respond Thursday. He could set the conviction aside, order a hearing or let the verdict stand without any further action. Whatever he decides could be appealed.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors have said they're prepared to retry Weinstein on the rape charge the jury couldn't decide last spring. Currently being held in New York, he also is appealing a rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "It plays a little loose with facts but the righteous rage of \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d is present enough in Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "It plays a little loose with facts but the righteous rage of \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d is present enough in Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d a based-on-a-true-tale hostage thriller that\u2019s as deeply 1970s as it is contemporary.",
      "In February 1977, Tony Kiritsis walked into the Meridian Mortgage Company in downtown Indianapolis and took one of its executives, Dick Hall, hostage. Kiritsis held a sawed-off shotgun to the back of Hall's head and draped a wire around his neck that connected to the gun. If he moved too much, he would die.",
      "The subsequent standoff moved to Kiritsis\u2019 apartment and eventually concluded in a live televised news conference. The whole ordeal received some renewed attention in a 2022 podcast dramatization starring Jon Hamm.",
      "But in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d starring Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Kiritsis, these events are vividly brought to life by Van Sant. It\u2019s been seven years since Van Sant directed, following 2018\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot,\u201d and one of the prevailing takeaways of his new film is that that\u2019s too long of a break for a filmmaker of Van Sant's caliber.",
      "Working from a script by Austin Kolodney, the filmmaker of \u201cMy Own Private Idaho\u201d and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d turns \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d into not a period-piece time capsule but a bracingly relevant drama of outrage and inequality. Tony feels aggrieved by his mortgage company over a land deal the bank, he claims, blocked. We\u2019re never given many specifics, but at the same time, there\u2019s little doubt in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d that Tony\u2019s cause is just. His means might be desperate and abhorrent, but the movie is very definitely on his side.",
      "That\u2019s owed significantly to Skarsg\u00e5rd, who gives one of his finest and least adorned performances. While best known for films like \u201cIt,\u201d \u201cThe Crow\u201d and \u201cNosferatu,\u201d here Skarsg\u00e5rd has little more than some green polyester and a very \u201970s mustache to alter his looks. The straightforward, jittery intensity of his performance propels \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "Yet Van Sant\u2019s film aspires to be a larger ensemble drama, which it only partially succeeds at. Tony\u2019s plight is far from a solitary one, as numerous threads suggest in Kolodney\u2019s fast-paced script. First and foremost is Colman Domingo as a local DJ named Fred Temple. (If ever there were an actor suited, with a smooth baritone, to play a \u201970s radio DJ, it\u2019s Domingo.) Tony, a fan, calls Fred to air his demands. But it\u2019s not just a media outlet for him. Fred touts himself as \u201cthe voice of the people.\u201d",

      "Something similar could be said of Tony, who rapidly emerges as a kind of folk hero. As much as he tortures his hostage (a very good Dacre Montgomery), he\u2019s kind to the police officers surrounding him. And as he and Dick spend more time together, Dick emerges as a kind of victim, himself. It\u2019s his father\u2019s bank, and when Tony gets M.L. Hall (Al Pacino) on the phone, he sounds painfully insensitive, sooner ready to sacrifice his son than acknowledge any wrongdoing.",
      "Pacino\u2019s presence in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d is a nod to \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d a movie that may be far better \u2014 but, then again, that\u2019s true of most films in comparison to Sidney Lumet\u2019s unsurpassed 1975 classic. Still, Van Sant\u2019s film bears some of the same rage and disillusionment with the meatgrinder of capitalism as \u201cDog Day.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also a telling, if not entirely successful subplot of a local TV news reporter (Myha\u2019la) struggling against stereotypes. Even when she gets the goods on the unspooling news story, the way her producer says to \u201cchop it up\u201d and put it on air makes it clear: Whatever Tony is rebelling against, it\u2019s him, not his plight, that will be served up on a prime-time plate.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take recent similar cases of national fascination, such as Luigi Mangione, charged with killing a healthcare executive, to see contemporary echoes of Kiritsis' tale. The real story is more complicated and less metaphor-ready, of course, than the movie, which detracts some from the film's gritty sense of verisimilitude. Staying closer to the truth might have produced a more dynamic movie.",
      "But \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d still works. In the film, Tony\u2019s demands are $5 million and an apology. It's clear the latter means more to him than the money. The tragedy in \u201cDead Man's Wire\u201d is just how elusive \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d can be.",

      "WASHINGTON -- New options for testing and treating some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are becoming available, a trend that experts hope will keep downward pressure on U.S. infection rates.",
      "Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first at-home test that can detect three common infections in women \u2014 gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis \u2014 as well as the first home-based kit for the virus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The agency ended the year by approving two different drugs for gonorrhea, the first new options for the disease in decades.",
      "It\u2019s positive news after cases of sexually transmitted infections reached alarming highs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted screening, education and treatment for sexual health nationwide.",
      "But the pandemic years also brought positive developments for testing. The same technology used for the first over-the-counter coronavirus tests is now being translated into home-based kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. Previously, the FDA had mostly limited the use of such tests to health professionals.",
      "\u201cSexual health can be stigmatized and people can be hesitant about testing,\u201d said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cNow we have a lot of options for patients who may be wary of going into a provider\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Testing company Visby Medical launched its three-in-one test for women last year, following FDA approval in March. The urine-based test includes a vaginal testing swab and a small electronic device that develops the results and sends them to an online app for review.",
      "The test, which costs $150, also includes a telehealth consultation with a medical provider who can discuss the results and prescribe antibiotics or other medication, if needed.",
      "The entire process \u2014 from buying the test to getting a prescription \u2014 can take as little as six hours, compared with several days under the traditional testing model, says Dr. Gary Schoolnik, Visby\u2019s chief medical officer.",
      "Previously, a nurse or doctor would have to collect a sample, send it out to a lab, get the results and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.",
      "\u201cMany patients are very hard to track down and a lot of them, if they have a positive test result, are never treated and are lost to follow-up,\u201d said Schoolnik, who is also a professor emeritus at Stanford Medical School.",
      "The FDA approved Visby\u2019s test based on study results showing that it correctly detected the three infections with accuracy rates around 98% or higher. That\u2019s similar to tests performed at hospitals and health clinics.",
      "Some home-based tests still require outside input to get the results.",
      "For example, in May the FDA approved Teal Health\u2019s testing kit for HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer. The company\u2019s Teal Wand allows women to collect their own vaginal sample, which is then placed in a tube and shipped to a laboratory for processing.",

And so this is gonna be fun for me, because I get to do this. Plus, I\u2019m gonna be able to help other vets.\u201d",
      "The ride through the Keys started Friday and runs through the weekend. While some riders are missing one or more limbs after combat injuries, the veterans are using bicycles fitted with special adaptive equipment. Other injuries, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, are not so visible.",
      "\u201cThe path to healing always starts with movement,\u201d Wounded Warrior Project CEO Walter Piatt said. \u201cThis is about getting them outside, getting them reconnected with people they serve with, and people are going through the same thing they are.\u201d",

      "The tally of 221-205 was a key test before passage of the bill, which is expected Thursday. And it came about because four GOP centrist lawmakers joined with Democrats in signing a so-called discharge petition to force the vote.

The action of forcing a vote has been an affront to Johnson and GOP leaders, who essentially lost control of their House majority as the renegade lawmakers joined Democrats for the workaround.",

      "Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel says his administration is not in talks with the U.S. government",
      "HAVANA -- Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel said Monday that his administration is not in talks with the U.S. government, a day after President Donald Trump threatened the Caribbean island in the wake of the U.S. attack on Venezuela.",
      "D\u00edaz-Canel posted a flurry of brief statements on X after Trump suggested that Cuba \u201cmake a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.\u201d He did not say what kind of deal.",
      "D\u00edaz-Canel wrote that for \u201crelations between the U.S. and Cuba to progress, they must be based on international law rather than hostility, threats, and economic coercion.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe have always been willing to hold a serious and responsible dialogue with the various US governments, including the current one, on the basis of sovereign equality, mutual respect, principles of International Law, and mutual benefit without interference in internal affairs and with full respect for our independence.\u201d",
      "His statements were reposted by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez on X.",
      "On Sunday, Trump wrote that Cuba would no longer live off oil and money from Venezuela, which the U.S. attacked on Jan. 3 in a stunning operation that killed 32 Cuban officers and led to the arrest of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Cuba was receiving an estimated 35,000 barrels a day from Venezuela before the U.S. attacked, along with some 5,500 barrels daily from Mexico and roughly 7,500 from Russia, according to Jorge Pi\u00f1\u00f3n of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, who tracks the shipments.",
      "On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum once again declined to provide data on current oil shipments or say whether such shipments would increase when Venezuelan supplies end. She insisted that the aid \u201chas been ongoing for a long time; it\u2019s not new.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico\u2019s fuel supply to Cuba is not a concern for her country because \u201cthere is enough oil\u201d \u2014 even though production of state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos is steadily declining. She reiterated that her government is willing to facilitate dialogue between the U.S. and Cuba if both agree.",
      "Even with oil shipments from Venezuela, widespread blackouts have persisted across Cuba given fuel shortages and a crumbling electric grid. Experts worry a lack of petroleum would only deepen the island's multiple crises that stem from an economic paralysis during the COVID-19 pandemic and a radical increase in U.S. sanctions following the first Trump administration, which aim to force a change in Cuba's political model.",
      "The communist government has said U.S. sanctions cost the country more than $7.5 billion between March 2024 and February 2025, a staggering sum for an island whose tourism revenue reached some $3 billion annually at its peak in the previous decade.",
      "The crisis also has triggered a large wave of migration primarily to the United States, where Cubans enjoyed immigration privileges as exiles. Those privileges were curtailed before Trump closed U.S. borders.",
      "The situation between the U.S. and Cuba is \u201cvery sad and concerning,\u201d said Andy S. G\u00f3mez, retired dean of the School of International Studies and senior fellow in Cuban Studies at the University of Miami.",
      "He said he sees D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s latest comments \u201cas a way to try and buy a little bit of time for the inner circle to decide what steps it\u2019s going to take.\u201d",
      "G\u00f3mez said he doesn\u2019t visualize Cuba reaching out to U.S. officials right now.",
      "\u201cThey had every opportunity when President (Barack) Obama opened up U.S. diplomatic relations, and yet they didn\u2019t even bring Cuban coffee to the table,\u201d G\u00f3mez said. \u201cOf course, these are desperate times for Cuba.\u201d",

      "Iran had no direct reaction to Trump's comments, which came after the foreign minister of Oman \u2014 long an interlocutor between Washington and Tehran \u2014 traveled to Iran this weekend. It also remains unclear just what Iran could promise, particularly as Trump has set strict demands over its nuclear program and its ballistic missile arsenal, which Tehran insists is crucial for its national defense.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking to foreign diplomats in Tehran, insisted \u201cthe situation has come under total control\u201d in fiery remarks that blamed Israel and the U.S. for the violence, without offering evidence.",

      "Meanwhile Monday, Iran drew tens of thousands of pro-government demonstrators to head to the streets in support of the theocracy, a show of force after days of protests directly challenging the rule of 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iranian state television aired chants from the crowd, which appeared to number in the tens of thousands, who shouted \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d",

      "Iran, through the country's parliamentary speaker, warned Sunday that the U.S. military and Israel would be \u201clegitimate targets\u201d if America uses force to protect demonstrators.",
      "More than 10,600 people also have been detained over the two weeks of protests, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in previous unrest in recent years and gave the death toll.

      "Kainerugaba, long believed to be the eventual successor, stood down for his father, President Yoweri Museveni, who is seeking a seventh term that would bring him closer to five decades in power.",
      "Yet Kainerugaba, a four-star general, remains a key figure in Ugandan politics as the chief enforcer of his father\u2019s rule in this east African country. He is the top military commander, appointed by his father nearly two years ago after Kainerugaba told a political rally he was ready to lead.",
      "Kainerugaba\u2019s appointment as army chief put his political campaign on hold \u2014 a least, critics say, for as long as Museveni still wants to stay.",

      "\u201cI will be President of Uganda after my father,\u201d he said in 2023, writing on social platform X. \u201cThose fighting the truth will be very disappointed.\u201d",
      "The president\u2019s son is more powerful than ever, his allies strategically deployed in command positions across the security services. As the presumed heir to the presidency, he is the recipient of loyalty pledges from candidates seeking minor political offices.",
      "Kainerugaba joined the army in the late 1990s, and his fast rise to the top of the armed forces proved controversial.",
      "In February 2024, a month before Kainerugaba was named army chief, the president officially delegated some of his authority as commander-in-chief to the head of the military.",
      "Exercising authority previously reserved for the president, including promoting army officers of high rank and creating new army departments, Kainerugaba is more powerful than any army chief before him, said Mwambutsya Ndebesa, a political historian at Uganda\u2019s Makerere University, adding that family rule appears inevitable.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t see a way out through constitutional means,\u201d he said.",
      "Elections, he said, \u201cis just wasting time, legitimizing authority but not intended as a democratic goal... Any change from Museveni will be determined by the military high command.\u201d",
      "With Museveni not saying when he would retire, a personality cult around Kainerugaba has emerged. Some Ugandans stage public celebrations of his birthday. Campaign posters of many seeking parliamentary seats often feature the emblem of Kainerugaba\u2019s political group, the Patriotic League of Uganda. Speaker of Parliament Anita Among last year called Kainerugaba \u201cGod the Son.\"",

      "Former executives of a defunct Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper are pleading for lighter sentences under a national security law",
      "HONG KONG -- Former executives of a now-defunct, pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong who were convicted under a national security law pleaded for lighter sentences Tuesday in a landmark case widely seen as a barometer of media freedom in a city once hailed as a bastion of free press in Asia.",
      "The former journalists pleaded guilty in 2022 to conspiracy to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security. They admitted to the prosecution's charge that said they conspired with their ex-boss and onetime media mogul Jimmy Lai to request foreign sanctions, blockades or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.",
      "Lai, the Apple Daily founder who pleaded not guilty in the case, was convicted in December. The verdict raised concerns about the city's declining press freedom and drew criticism from foreign governments.",
      "But the government insists the case has nothing to do with media freedom, saying the defendants used news reporting as a pretext for years to commit acts that harmed China and Hong Kong.",
      "Their sentences are expected to be handed down at a later date.",
      "Six Apple Daily executives were convicted in Lai's case: publisher Cheung Kim-hung; associate publisher Chan Pui-man; editor-in-chief Ryan Law; executive editor-in-chief Lam Man-chung; executive editor-in-chief responsible for English news Fung Wai-kong; and editorial writer Yeung Ching-kee. Some of them served as prosecution witnesses during the 156-day trial.",
      "A conviction on the collusion charge carries a sentence ranging from three years to life in prison. But a guilty plea can result in a sentence reduction. Under the security law, a reduced penalty may be granted to those who report on offenses committed by others.",
      "Chan's lawyer, Marco Li, said if the judges decided to place his client in the upper sentencing band, he suggested the starting point should be 10 years, given her limited role. Citing factors including her timely plea and assistance to the prosecution, he asked for her sentence to be halved.",
      "Li said Chan, who started working at Apple Daily in 1996, regretted not resisting even more firmly when matters arose that made her uncomfortable. But according to her mitigation letter, Chan couldn't leave her beloved job casually at that time because she was suffering serious health issues and was under financial burden.",

      "Lai founded Apple Daily in 1995, two years before Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule. It attracted a strong following with its sometimes sensational reports, investigative scoops and eventual short animated video reports. Being openly critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, the newspaper was well-received among pro-democracy readers.",
      "During Hong Kong's massive anti-government protests in 2019, Apple Daily ran articles sympathetic to protesters and supportive of the pro-democracy movement that saw hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets.",
      "After Beijing imposed the security law to quell the protests, Lai was one of the first prominent figures to be arrested. Within a year, Apple Daily's former executives also were arrested. The prosecutions, asset freeze and police raids forced the newspaper's closure in June 2021. Its final edition sold a million copies.",
      "In their December verdict, the three government-appointed judges said Lai had used Apple Daily as a platform for spreading his political ideas and implementing his political agenda before and after the introduction of the security law.",
      "The judges on Monday heard arguments about the sentencing of Lai, Cheung and two other non-Apple Daily activists involved in the former publisher\u2019s case.",
      "When Lai entered the courtroom Tuesday, he smiled at people sitting in the public gallery as a supporter formed a heart shape with her hands.",

      "President Donald Trump is traveling to Michigan to promote his efforts to boost U.S. manufacturing",
      "DETROIT -- President Donald Trump will travel to Michigan on Tuesday to promote his efforts to boost U.S. manufacturing, trying to counter fears about a weakening job market and worries that still-rising prices are taking a toll on Americans' pocketbooks.",
      "The day trip will include a tour of a Ford factory in Dearborn that makes F-150 pickups, the bestselling domestic vehicle in the U.S. The president is also set to address the Detroit Economic Club at the MotorCity Casino.",
      "November's off-year elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere showed a shift away from Republicans as public concerns about kitchen table issues persist. In their wake, the White House said Trump would put a greater emphasis on talking directly to the public about his economic policies after doing relatively few events around the country earlier in his term.",
      "The president has suggested that jitters about affordability are a \u201choax\u201d unnecessarily stirred by Democrats. Still, though he's imposed steep tariffs on U.S. trading partners around the world, Trump has reduced some of them when it comes to making cars \u2014 including extending import levies on foreign-made auto parts until 2030.",
      "Ford announced last month that it was scrapping plans to make an electric F-150, despite pouring billions into broader electrification, after the Trump administration slashed targets to have half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030, eliminated EV tax credits and proposed weakening the emissions and gas mileage rules.",
      "His Michigan swing follows economy-focused speeches the president gave last month in Pennsylvania \u2014 where Trump's gripes about immigrants arriving to the U.S. from \u201cfilthy\u201d countries got more attention than his pledges to fight inflation \u2014 and North Carolina, where he insisted his tariffs have spurred the economy, despite residents noting the squeeze of higher prices.",
      "Trump carried Michigan in 2016 and 2024, after it swung Democratic and backed Joe Biden in 2020. He marked his first 100 days in office with a rally-style April speech outside Detroit, where he focused more on past campaign grudges than his administration's economic or policy plans.",
      "During that visit nearly nine months ago, Trump also spoke at Selfridge Air National Guard Base and announced a new fighter jet mission, allaying fears that the base could close. It represented a win for Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer \u2014 and the two even shared a hug.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Inflation likely remained elevated last month as the cost of electricity, groceries, and clothing may have jumped and continued to pressure consumers' wallets.",
      "The Labor Department is expected to report that consumer prices rose 2.6% in December compared with a year earlier, according to economists' estimates compiled by data provider FactSet. The yearly rate would be down from 2.7% in November. Monthly prices, however, are expected to rise 0.3% in December, faster than is consistent with the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation goal.",
      "The figures are harder to predict this month, however, because the six-week government shutdown last fall suspended the collection of price data used to compile the inflation rate. Some economists expect the December figures will show a bigger jump in inflation as the data collection process gets back to normal.",
      "Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, are also expected to rise 0.3% in December from the previous month, and 2.7% from a year earlier. The yearly core figure would be an increase from 2.6% in November.",
      "In November, annual inflation fell from 3% in September to 2.7%, in part because of quirks in November's data. (The government never calculated a yearly figure for October). Most prices were collected in the second half of November, after the government reopened, when holiday discounts kicked in, which may have biased November inflation lower.",
      "And since rental prices weren't fully collected in October, the agency that prepares the inflation reports used placeholder estimates that may have biased prices lower, economists said.",
      "Inflation has come down significantly from the four-decade peak of 9.1% that it reached in June 2022, but it has been stubbornly close to 3% since late 2023. The cost of necessities such as groceries is about 25% higher than it was before the pandemic, and other necessities such as rent and clothing have also gotten more expensive, fueling dissatisfaction with the economy that both President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden have sought to address, though with limited success.",
      "The Federal Reserve has struggled to balance its goal of fighting inflation by keeping borrowing costs high, while also supporting hiring by cutting interest rates when unemployment worsens. As long as inflation remains above its target of 2%, the Fed will likely be reluctant to cut rates much more.",

The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said.",

Figueroa, who has asthma and recently learned her lung cancer is back, worries about health risks.",

Proponents see it as key to helping California reduce planet-warming pollution by curbing reliance on gas while integrating cleaner energy into existing infrastructure. It's part of a statewide effort to create safety rules for hydrogen blending. But opponents say it poses unnecessary risks, and Orange Cove's mostly Latino and low-income residents say processes are happening without transparency or their input. Projects in states such as Colorado and Oregon have also raised concerns.",
      "Interest in deploying hydrogen boomed during the Biden administration but has been hard hit with the Trump administration's cancellation of billions of dollars for hydrogen technology and other clean energy projects, including $1.2 billion for a hydrogen hub in California.",

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has touted it \u201can essential aspect of how we\u2019ll power our future and cut pollution.\"",

The U.S. has a vast network of gas pipelines \u2014 about 3 million miles, according to the Department of Energy \u2014 which can be used to move clean hydrogen while reducing reliance on gas, she said. If scaled, it could be cost-competitive and help industries that can't fully electrify pollute less.",
      "\u201cThe way to move us away and really clean our air and minimize our reliance on fossil fuels is by having a viable alternative,\u201d she said.",

The consensus is that up to 20% hydrogen by volume is safe, she said, but \u201cwe need more experimental work that uses real natural gas infrastructure to fully understand the impacts of hydrogen.\"",
      "In 2022, several gas companies filed a joint application to pursue hydrogen blending. The California Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a decision this year.",
      "SoCalGas first proposed testing hydrogen blending in facilities at the University of California, Irvine, in an affluent community. But it scaled back and revised its proposal following protests. When Orange Cove leaders expressed interest, the gas company identified the city an ideal candidate \u2014 it has various pipeline materials, including steel and polyethylene, a type of plastic, and only one gas feed coming in, allowing them ample control of the blend.",

      "The push by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who arrives Wednesday, is part of a major rethink as ties sour with the U.S. \u2014 the world's No. 1 economy and long the largest trading partner for Canada by far.",
      "Carney aims to double Canada\u2019s non-American exports in the next decade in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and the American leader's musing that Canada could become \u201cthe 51st state.\u201d",

      "In a joint statement, Liberal lawmakers Helena Jaczek and Marie-France Lalonde said while they are returning to Canada based on \u201cadvice from the government,\u201d it does not change Canada\u2019s stance on Taiwan. China views self-governed Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has said it would take it by force if needed.",

      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- Beneath an eight-lane expressway, Nigerian men stand waist-deep in the Lagos Lagoon, lowering buckets into murky water. Each load brings up sand, reshaping the coastline of Africa\u2019s largest city and driving away fish and livelihoods for some of its poorest people.",
      "Not far from the bridge, wooden boats are loaded with sand. One of thousands of local dredgers, Akeem Sossu, 34, has been diving for sand for at least three years. He slips beneath the surface for about 15 seconds at a time, hauling up bucketloads bound for construction sites.",
      "Akeem said he and his partner earn about 12,000 naira ($8) each per boatload, selling to a middleman who supplies larger buyers. Filling a boat takes about three hours. Formerly a tailor, he said dredging now supports his household.",

      "The changes to the lagoon that buffers the megacity of about 17 million people are unmistakable. What was once an open stretch of water is increasingly broken up by sandy patches, narrowing channels and reshaping currents that support thousands of fishermen.",
      "The transformation is most visible near Makoko, one of Lagos\u2019 oldest fishing communities. Dredging barges operate close to homes built on stilts, while reclaimed land and construction of upscale beachfront properties press in from the edges.

      "An autistic Barbie is joining Mattel's line of fashion dolls that's intended to celebrate diversity",
      "NEW YORK -- Mattel Inc. is introducing an autistic Barbie on Monday as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity, joining a collection that already includes Barbies with Down syndrome, a blind Barbie, a Barbie and a Ken with vitiligo, and other models the toymaker added to make its fashion dolls more inclusive.",
      "Mattel said it developed the autistic doll over more than 18 months in partnership with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates for the rights and better media representation of people with autism. The goal: to create a Barbie that reflected some of the ways autistic people may experience and process the world around them, according to a Mattel news release.",
      "That was a challenge because autism encompasses a broad range of behaviors and difficulties that vary widely in degree, and many of the traits associated with the disorder are not immediately visible, according to Noor Pervez, who is the Autistic Self Advocacy Network's community engagement manager and worked closely with Mattel on the Barbie prototype.",
      "Like many disabilities, \u201cautism doesn\u2019t look any one way,\u201d Pervez said. \u201cBut we can try and show some of the ways that autism expresses itself.\u201d",
      "For example, the eyes of the new Barbie shift slightly to the side to represent how some people with autism sometimes avoid direct eye contact, he said. The doll also was given articulated elbows and wrists to acknowledge stimming, hand flapping and other gestures that some autistic people use to process sensory information or to express excitement, according to Mattel.",
      "The development team debated whether to dress the doll in a tight or a loose-fitting outfit, Pervez said. Some autistic people wear loose clothes because they are sensitive to the feel of fabric seams, while others wear figure-hugging garments to give them a sense of where their bodies are, he said.",
      "The team ended up choosing an A-line dress with short sleeves and a flowy skirt that provides less fabric-to-skin contact. The doll also wears flat shoes to promote stability and ease of movement, according to Mattel.",

      "The addition of the autistic doll to the Barbie Fashionistas line also became an occasion for Mattel to create a doll with facial features inspired by the company\u2019s employees in India and mood boards reflecting a range of women with Indian backgrounds. Pervez said it was important to have the doll represent a segment of the autistic community that is generally underrepresented.",
      "Mattel introduced its first doll with Down syndrome in 2023 and brought out a Barbie representing a person with Type 1 diabetes last summer. The Fashionistas also include a Barbie and a Ken with a prosthetic leg, and a Barbie with hearing aids, but the line also encompasses tall, petite and curvy body types and numerous hair types and skin colors.",
      "\u201cBarbie has always strived to reflect the world kids see and the possibilities they imagine, and we\u2019re proud to introduce our first autistic Barbie as part of that ongoing work,\u201d Jamie Cygielman, Mattel\u2019s global head of dolls, said in a statement.",
      "The doll was expected to be available at Mattel's online shop and at Target stores starting Monday for a suggested retail price of $11.87. Walmart stores are expected to start carrying the new Barbie in March, Mattel said.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year that the estimated prevalence of autism among 8-year-old children in the U.S. was 1 in 31. The estimate from the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network said Black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander children in the U.S. were more likely than white children to have a diagnosis, and the prevalence more than three times higher among boys than girls.",

      "The move represents an unprecedented escalation in President Donald Trump's battle with the Fed, an independent agency he has repeatedly attacked for not cutting its key interest rate as sharply as he prefers. The renewed fight will likely rattle financial markets Monday and could over time escalate borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans.",
      "The subpoenas relate to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June, the Fed chair said, regarding the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation of two office buildings, a project that Trump has criticized as excessive.",
      "Powell on Sunday cast off what has up to this point been a restrained approach to Trump's criticisms and personal insults, which he has mostly ignored. Instead, Powell issued a video statement in which he bluntly characterized the threat of criminal charges as simple \u201cpretexts\u201d to undermine the Fed\u2019s independence when it comes to setting interest rates.",
      "\u201cThe threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said. \u201cThis is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions \u2014 or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\u201d",
      "It's a sharp departure from the Fed's understated response to Trump this year. The central bank has attempted to placate the administration by dialing back some policies, such as efforts to consider the impact of climate change on the banking system, that the administration clearly opposed.",
      "The renewed attacks on the Fed\u2019s independence, and Powell\u2019s full-throated defense, reignite what had appeared to be a dormant battle between Trump and the chair he appointed in 2017. The subpoenas will renew fears that the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics will be compromised, which could undermine global investors' confidence in U.S. Treasury securities.",

      "A Hong Kong court is hearing arguments about the sentencing of democracy advocate Jimmy Lai",
      "HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong court heard arguments Monday about the sentencing of democracy advocate and onetime-media magnate Jimmy Lai, whose conviction under a national security law could land him in prison for the rest of his life.",
      "Lai founded the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper and was an outspoken critic of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party. He was arrested in 2020 under the law imposed by Beijing following massive anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong the year before.",
      "In December, he was found guilty of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces and conspiracy to publish seditious articles.",
      "His conviction raised concerns about the curtailing of press freedom in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "His case could also test Beijing's diplomatic ties. The verdict drew criticism from foreign governments, including the U.S. and Britain. After the verdict, U.S. President Donald Trump, who had raised Lai\u2019s case with China, said he felt \u201cso badly.\u201d",
      "Lai, alongside other co-defendants, appeared in court for the four-day mitigation hearings. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment. Sentencing will come later.",
      "Lai\u2019s lawyer Robert Pang said his client's health, age and solitary confinement would make his sentence \u201cmore burdensome\u201d compared to that of the general prison population. Lai is 78, so the impact of a lengthy prison sentence will be greater, Pang argued.",
      "\u201cEvery day he spends in prison,\" Pang said, \u201cbrings him closer to the end of his life.\u201d",
      "When Lai entered the courtroom, he pressed his palms together, an apparent gesture to express gratitude, and smiled at those sitting in the gallery. The media tycoon appeared to be in good spirits and greeted a convicted Apple Daily editor who was also in the dock.",
      "In August, his lawyers told the court that he suffered from heart palpitations. Hong Kong\u2019s government said no abnormalities were found in a subsequent medical exam.",
      "Prosecutor Anthony Chau said Lai\u2019s health was stable. Chau said Lai had lost just 0.8 kg (about 1.8 pounds) over five years of detention, weighing 79.2 kg (about 175 pounds) when it was last measured this month. Lai is still considered obese as an Asian adult, Chau said. The obesity comment drew chuckles from some people sitting in the public gallery, and Lai also smiled.",
      "But Pang argued that his client no longer lived up to his nickname of \u201cFatty Lai,\u201d in contrast to images in videos filmed before detention and previously shown to the court.",
      "Esther Toh, one of the three government-vetted judges, rejected estimating weight by relying on human eyes, saying people may look fatter on camera. Pang also said Lai's weight once dropped 11 kg (24 pounds) within a year, though the court heard he later regained some of the weight.",
      "The lawyer said Lai suffers health issues like hypertension, diabetes and a blocked vein in one eye.",
      "Pang argued his client's solitary confinement \u2014 which Chau earlier said was at Lai's request \u2014 was making his prison life \u201charsher\u201d than others.",
      "Before sunrise, dozens of people had already lined up outside the court building to secure a seat in the public gallery. Retiree Simon Ng, a former Apple Daily reader, said he arrived and waited in line since Friday morning, hoping to see Lai.",

Some of them, alongside the two activists Andy Li and Chan Tsz-wah, served as prosecution witnesses during the 156-day trial.",
      "A guilty plea usually can lead to a sentence reduction. Under the security law, a reduced penalty may be granted to those who report on the offense committed by others.",
      "Lawyers representing the two activists suggested their clients\u2019 final sentences should be cut to under 10 years in part due to their cooperation in the case. Cheung\u2019s lawyer, Lucas Lau, also cited his client's help in the case as one of the factors for a lighter penalty.",

      "Hong Kong's press freedom has dramatically declined over some 20 years, falling from 18th to 140th in a global press freedom index",
      "HONG KONG -- From 18th place to 140th. That's how much Hong Kong's ranking plunged in a global press freedom index over some 20 years.",
      "Behind the decline are the shutdown of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, more red lines for journalists and increasing self-censorship across the territory. The erosion of press freedom parallels a broader curtailment of the city's Western-style civil liberties since 2020, when Beijing imposed a national security law to eradicate challenges to its rule.",
      "Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai was convicted in December under the security law, facing up to life in prison. Hearings began Monday for Lai and other defendants in the case to argue for a shorter sentence.",
      "His trial has been watched closely by foreign governments and political observers as a barometer of media freedom in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The government insists that his case has nothing to do with press freedom.",
      "Hong Kong's media environment was once freewheeling. Journalists often asked the government aggressive questions even as the owners of their outlets were pro-Beijing. News outlets regularly broke stories critical of politicians and officials.",
      "But the space for reporters has drastically narrowed after China imposed the security law, which it deemed necessary for stability after huge anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "In 2020, Lai became one of the first prominent figures charged under the law. Within a year, authorities used the same law to arrest senior executives of Apple Daily. They raided its office and froze $2.3 million of its assets, effectively forcing the newspaper to shut down in June 2021.",
      "Online news site Stand News met a similar fate in December of that year, with arrests, police raids and asset freezes forcing its shutdown. By 2022, Hong Kong had plunged 68 places to 148th in the press-freedom index compiled by media freedom organization Reporters Without Borders.",
      "In 2024, two Stand News editors became the first journalists since 1997 to be convicted of conspiracy to publish seditious articles under a separate, colonial-era law.",
      "In December, Lai was found guilty of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces and conspiracy to publish seditious articles. Six Apple Daily executives charged in the same case had entered guilty pleas, admitting they conspired with Lai to request sanctions, blockades or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.",
      "Francis Lee, a journalism and communication professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the Apple Daily and Stand News cases indicate that some common news practices of the past are no longer permitted. The Stand News case showed that some strongly critical commentaries with relatively intense expression might be considered seditious, he said. Lai's case involved allegations of calling for foreign sanctions.",
      "\u201cMaybe some advocacy journalism was at least permitted within the legal framework back then,\" he said, referring to before the security law was introduced. \u201cToday, it\u2019s no longer allowed.\u201d",
      "Self-censorship has become more prominent, but not only because of politics. Lee said mainstream news outlets face greater pressure not to upset their vital revenue streams, including advertisers and big companies, amid a difficult business environment.",
      "Many large companies in the city value the vast mainland Chinese market and ties with the government.",
      "Finding interviewees is not easy, either. \u201cIn Hong Kong nowadays, when some topics and perspectives cannot be reported, it's not just because of media outlets practicing self-censorship,\" Lee said. \u201cNo one is willing to speak. Self-censorship is a broad social phenomenon.\"",
      "Many opposition politicians and leading activists were jailed under the security law. Dozens of civil society groups closed down. Facing potential risks, some residents also became more reluctant to talk to reporters.",
      "Hong Kong Journalists Association chairperson Selina Cheng said many stories perceived to be politically sensitive or potentially questioning the authorities are not always easily published. There is an outsized concern over including responses from the government and pro-China groups to create balance, she said.",

      "After arrests of non-journalists who posted allegedly seditious content online or organized a petition, public voices grew quieter, leaving reporters with fewer interviewees, Lee said.",
      "A planned news conference related to the fire, organized by people including former pro-democracy district councilors, was canceled. Bruce Liu, an organizer, was summoned by police for a meeting the same day. An investigative report on the maintenance project by a pro-Beijing newspaper is no longer viewable on its website.",

      "NEW YORK -- Thousands of nurses at some of New York City's biggest hospitals could go on strike Monday during a severe flu season, three years after a similar walkout forced some of the same medical facilities to transfer some patients and divert ambulances.",
      "The looming strike could impact operations at several of the city\u2019s major private hospitals, including Mount Sinai in Manhattan, Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.",
      "Nearly 15,000 nurses could walk off the job early Monday if a deal is not reached, amounting to the largest nurses strike in city history, according to Nancy Hagans, president of the New York State Nurses Association. As of Sunday morning, little progress had been made at the bargaining table, Hagans said. A vast majority of the union's nurses voted to authorize the strike last month.",
      "Like the 2023 labor fight, this year's dispute involves a complicated array of issues, claims, counterclaims and hospital-by-hospital particulars. Once again, staffing levels are a major flashpoint: Nurses say the big-budget medical centers are refusing to commit to \u2014 or even backsliding on \u2014 provisions for manageable, safe workloads.",
      "This time, the nurses' union also wants guardrails on hospitals using artificial intelligence, plus more workplace security measures. A gunman strode into Mount Sinai in November, and a man with a sharp object barricaded himself in a Brooklyn hospital room this week; both men ultimately were killed by police.",
      "The private, nonprofit hospitals involved in the current negotiations say they've made strides in staffing since 2023. Some of them suggest the union's demands, taken as a whole, are far too expensive.",

      "The strike ended with an agreement on raises totaling 19% over three years and staffing improvements, including the possibility of extra pay if nurses had to work short-handed.",

      "President Donald Trump says he wants a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates",
      "NEW YORK -- Reviving a campaign pledge, President Donald Trump wants a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates, a move that could save Americans tens of billions of dollars but drew immediate opposition from an industry that has been in his corner.",
      "Trump was not clear in his social media post Friday night whether a cap might take effect through executive action or legislation, though one Republican senator said he had spoken with the president and would work on a bill with his \u201cfull support.\u201d Trump said he hoped it would be in place Jan. 20, one year after he took office.",
      "Strong opposition is certain from Wall Street in addition to the credit card companies, which donated heavily to his 2024 campaign and have supported Trump's second-term agenda. Banks are making the argument that such a plan would most hurt poor people, at a time of economic concern, by curtailing or eliminating credit lines, driving them to high-cost alternatives like payday loans or pawnshops.",
      "\u201cWe will no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Researchers who studied Trump\u2019s campaign pledge after it was first announced found that Americans would save roughly $100 billion in interest a year if credit card rates were capped at 10%. The same researchers found that while the credit card industry would take a major hit, it would still be profitable, although credit card rewards and other perks might be scaled back.",
      "About 195 million people in the United States had credit cards in 2024 and were assessed $160 billion in interest charges, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says. Americans are now carrying more credit card debt than ever, to the tune of about $1.23 trillion, according to figures from the New York Federal Reserve for the third quarter last year.",
      "Further, Americans are paying, on average, between 19.65% and 21.5% in interest on credit cards according to the Federal Reserve and other industry tracking sources. That has come down in the past year as the central bank lowered benchmark rates, but is near the highs since federal regulators started tracking credit card rates in the mid-1990s. That\u2019s significantly higher than a decade ago, when the average credit card interest rate was roughly 12%.",
      "The Republican administration has proved particularly friendly until now to the credit card industry.",
      "Capital One got little resistance from the White House when it finalized its purchase and merger with Discover Financial in early 2025, a deal that created the nation\u2019s largest credit card company. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is largely tasked with going after credit card companies for alleged wrongdoing, has been largely nonfunctional since Trump took office.",
      "In a joint statement, the banking industry was opposed to Trump's proposal.",
      "\u201cIf enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" the American Bankers Association and allied groups said.",
      "Bank lobbyists have long argued that lowering interest rates on their credit card products would require the banks to lend less to high-risk borrowers. When Congress enacted a cap on the fee that stores pay large banks when customers use a debit card, banks responded by removing all rewards and perks from those cards. Debit card rewards only recently have trickled back into consumers' hands. For example, United Airlines now has a debit card that gives miles with purchases.",
      "The U.S. already places interest rate caps on some financial products and for some demographics. The Military Lending Act makes it illegal to charge active-duty service members more than 36% for any financial product. The national regulator for credit unions has capped interest rates on credit union credit cards at 18%.",

      "Credit card companies earn three streams of revenue from their products: fees charged to merchants, fees charged to customers and the interest charged on balances. The argument from some researchers and left-leaning policymakers is that the banks earn enough revenue from merchants to keep them profitable if interest rates were capped.",
      "\"A 10% credit card interest cap would save Americans $100 billion a year without causing massive account closures, as banks claim. That\u2019s because the few large banks that dominate the credit card market are making absolutely massive profits on customers at all income levels,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator, who wrote the research on the industry's impact of Trump's proposal last year.",
      "There are some historic examples that interest rate caps do cut off the less creditworthy to financial products because banks are not able to price risk correctly. Arkansas has a strictly enforced interest rate cap of 17% and evidence points to the poor and less creditworthy being cut out of consumer credit markets in the state. Shearer's research showed that an interest rate cap of 10% would likely result in banks lending less to those with credit scores below 600.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how the president seeks to cap the rate or whether he has spoken with credit card companies about the idea.",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., who said he talked with Trump on Friday night, said the effort is meant to \u201clower costs for American families and to reign in greedy credit card companies who have been ripping off hardworking Americans for too long.\"",
      "Legislation in both the House and the Senate would do what Trump is seeking.",
      "Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., released a plan in February that would immediately cap interest rates at 10% for five years, hoping to use Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build momentum for their measure.",
      "Hours before Trump's post, Sanders said that the president, rather than working to cap interest rates, had taken steps to deregulate big banks that allowed them to charge much higher credit card fees.",
      "Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., have proposed similar legislation. Ocasio-Cortez is a frequent political target of Trump, while Luna is a close ally of the president.",

      "\u201cThis agreement is destined to boost our exports, with the goal of reaching 700 billion euros in exports,\" Tajani wrote in a post on X. He acknowledged the deal required a long negotiation, but added that Italy had secured protections for its farmers, \"especially regarding production standards.\u201d",
      "Meloni said at a press conference on Friday she never had \u201cany ideological objections\u201d to the Mercosur agreement.",
      "\"We have always said we will be in favor of it when there are sufficient guarantees for our farmers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe agreement\u2019s potential is good, but not at the expense of the excellence of our products.\u201d",
      "The deal would create one of the world's largest free trade zones, covering some 780 million people from Uruguay to Romania and a quarter of the globe\u2019s gross domestic product.",

      "Still, Macron said the potential economic gains of the Mercosur deal are limited and do not justify the risks it poses to EU agriculture. His office stated that the deal would only add 77 billion euros ($89.7 billion) by 2040 \u2014 half a percent of the EU's GDP.",

      "Lower courts ruled for the transgender athletes in Idaho and West Virginia who challenged the state bans, but the conservative-dominated Supreme Court might not follow suit.",
      "In just the past year, the justices ruled in favor state bans on gender-affirming care for transgender youth and allowed multiple restrictions on transgender people to be enforced.",
      "The legal fight is playing out amid a broad effort by President Donald Trump to target transgender Americans, begnning on the first day of his second term and including the ouster of transgender people from the military and declaring that gender is immutable and determined at birth.",
      "The culture war cases come from Idaho and West Virginia, among the first of the more than two dozen Republican-led states that have banned transgender athletes from girls' and women\u2019s teams.",
      "The justices are evaluating claims of sex discrimination lodged by transgender people versus the need for fair competition for women and girls, the main argument made by the states.",
      "In the first case, Lindsay Hecox, 25, sued over Idaho's first-in-the-nation ban for the chance to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams at Boise State University in Idaho. She didn't make either squad, but competed in club-level soccer and running.",
      "Becky Pepper-Jackson, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, has been taking puberty-blocking medication, publicly identified as a girl since age 8 and has been issued a West Virginia birth certificate recognizing her as female. She is the only transgender person who has sought to compete in girls' sports in West Virginia.",

Tennis champion Martina Navratilova, swimmers Summer Sanders and Donna de Varona and beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh-Jennings are supporting the state bans. Soccer stars Megan Rapinoe and Becky Sauerbrunn and basketball players Sue Byrd and Breanna Stewart back the transgender athletes.",

      "But last year, the six conservative justices declined to apply the same sort of analysis when they upheld state bans on gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",
      "The states supporting the prohibitions on transgender athletes argue there is no reason to extend the ruling barring workplace discrimination to Title IX, which dramatically increased opportunities for girls and women in school sports.",
      "Lawyers for Pepper-Jackson argue that the law protects individuals like their client from discrimination. They are asking for a ruling that would apply to the unique circumstances of her early transition. In Hecox's case, her lawyers want the court to dismiss the case because she has forsworn trying to play on women's teams.",
      "Despite the small numbers of transgender athletes, the issue has taken on outsize importance. The NCAA and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committees banned transgender women from women\u2019s sports after Trump signed an executive order aimed at barring their participation.",
      "The public generally is supportive of the limits. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in October 2025 found that about 6 in 10 U.S. adults \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favored requiring transgender children and teenagers to only compete on sports teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with, while about 2 in 10 were \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d opposed and about one-quarter did not have an opinion.",

      "PITTSBURGH -- Sheldon Rankins is well-versed in the Houston Texans' nondescript playoff history. The veteran defensive tackle is hell-bent on writing a different ending this time.",
      "And he's hardly alone. The NFL's best defense is eager to prove it's a unit capable of winning a championship.",
      "So far, so dominant and so, so good.",
      "Rankins returned a fumble by Aaron Rodgers 33 yards for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter to break open a tight game, and the Texans beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 30-6 on Monday night for the first road playoff win in franchise history.",
      "\u201cWe're here for it all,\u201d Rankins said after Houston (13-5) won its 10th straight game. \u201cI won't sugarcoat it, won't dance around that topic. We're here for the whole thing.\u201d",
      "The next step comes Sunday at New England (15-3), where the Texans will try to reach the AFC Championship game for the first time.",
      "If Houston can replicate what it did at chilly Acrisure Stadium, it might get there. The Texans limited Pittsburgh (10-8) to 175 total yards, including 81 in the second half. Coach DeMeco Ryans called it the best defensive performance in the franchise's 24-year history.",
      "\u201cEvery time we go out there, we show (we're the best),\u201d said Houston cornerback Calen Bullock, who picked off what might be the final pass of Rodgers' Hall of Fame career and raced 50 yards for the final score. \u201cWe went out there and showed it today. I don't think they even scored a touchdown.\u201d",
      "No, they didn't. The Steelers managed just a pair of first-half field goals by Chris Boswell to lose at home on a Monday night for the first time since 1991. Pittsburgh and coach Mike Tomlin have now dropped seven straight playoff games, with Tomlin tying former Bengals coach Marvin Lewis for the longest postseason losing skid in NFL history.",
      "\u201cI don't necessarily compare it to any other moment,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cIt's the here and now, and certainly it's difficult. But that's what we sign up for. That's the life we live.\u201d",
      "C.J. Stroud turned it over three times but also threw a first-half touchdown pass to Christian Kirk, who had eight catches for 144 yards. Woody Marks had 112 yards rushing for Houston, which had been 0-6 on the road in the postseason.",
      "\u201cIt's all about moving forward and trying your best to flush it and keep going,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cEvery time we had to bounce back, we made more plays.\u201d",
      "Marks' 13-yard touchdown run with 3:43 to go sealed it, and Bullock got his pick-6 less than a minute later.",
      "Rodgers passed for just 146 yards in the final game of his 21st season. Whether there's a 22nd is anyone's guess. The four-time MVP will take some time before deciding whether to return next fall.",
      "While Rodgers' play down the stretch was one of the reasons the Steelers won the AFC North, he struggled in much the same way as his predecessors, Russell Wilson and Mason Rudolph, did.",
      "\u201cI'm not going to make any emotional decisions,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI'm disappointed. Obviously, it was such a fun year. A lot of adversity but a lot of fun.\u201d",

      "Brooks Koepka is back on the PGA Tour five weeks after leaving LIV Golf",
      "HONOLULU -- Brooks Koepka becomes the first LIV Golf player to return to the PGA Tour under a one-time program for elite players.",
      "It's not a free pass back to the PGA Tour. Koepka has to make a $5 million charitable donation. He won't be able to receive PGA Tour equity grants for five years. He isn't eligible for FedEx Cup bonus money in 2026. And he can't receive sponsor exemptions into the $20 million signature events.",
      "He plans to return in the Farmers Insurance Open on Jan. 29 at Torrey Pines in San Diego. He is eligible to reach the lucrative FedEx Cup postseason. He also is eligible for the Presidents Cup and for the indoor TGL circuit in Florida.",
      "But the CEO of PGA Tour Enterprises, Brian Rolapp, said this was not a precedent and that only three other LIV Golf players were eligible to return.",
      "Here's a rundown on Koepka's return and what it means for other players and the rest of golf.",
      "The PGA Tour board developed a \u201cReturning Member Program\u201d that applies to players who have won majors or The Players Championship since 2022 and have been away from the PGA Tour for at least two years. Koepka won the 2023 PGA Championship at Oak Hill, one year after he defected to LIV Golf for what Koepka had said was a deal worth at least $100 million. Koepka had one year left on his LIV contract when he and the Saudi-backed group agreed to an amicable split. Koepka is exempt through 2028 because of his PGA Championship win.",
      "That depends. The out-of-pocket expense is the $5 million donation to charity, which the tour will help decide. By not having access to equity grants, the tour estimates that could deprive him up to $63 million. That's based on Koepka averaging a top-30 finish the next five years, a 10-12% equity appreciation and Koepka holding his shares until age 50.",
      "He also cannot get FedEx Cup bonus money from the $20 million pool distributed to the top 10 players after the regular season, and $23 million awarded to 50 players after the BMW Championship. But the Tour Championship is now official money, and that $40 million purse counts as official. Tommy Fleetwood earned $10 million in official money from winning the Tour Championship last year.",
      "Bryson DeChambeau won the 2024 U.S. Open. Jon Rahm wont he 2023 Masters. Cameron Smith won the British Open and The Players Championship in 2022. They are the only other players who can return to the PGA Tour. They have until Feb. 2 to accept. That's two days before LIV Golf begins a fifth season in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The PGA Tour did not clarify why it chose the 2022-25 window. LIV Golf began in 2022. But that rules out major champions Phil Mickelson (2021 PGA Championship), Dustin Johnson (2020 Masters), Patrick Reed (2018 Masters) and Sergio Garcia (2017 Masters).",
      "Also ineligible to return are Joaquin Niemann, a seven-time winner on LIV Golf, and Tyrrell Hatton, who has played on the last three Ryder Cup teams for Europe.",

      "Dec 30, 4:51 PM",
      "None of those players has expressed any desire to leave LIV.",
      "No. Rolapp described Koepka as a unique situation and made clear this would not be a precedent, rather a one-time program that applies only to elite champions. He also said there were no guarantees such a pathway would be available in the future.",
      "Koepka is eligible for the four majors and The Players Championship (through his PGA Championship win), along with any full-field event on the schedule. He would have to qualify for the $20 million signature events through winning a tour event or through the two performance-based pathways, such as being among top 10 in the FedEx Cup not already eligible. But he cannot get a sponsor exemption to the signature events. He also is eligible for the FedEx Cup postseason if he qualifies.",
      "If Koepka gets into a signature event, or if he qualifies for the postseason, the PGA Tour would add him to the field and take whoever would have been next in line. For example, he finishes among the top 70 to qualify for the postseason, the tour would take No. 71 in the FedEx Cup standings.",

Frederique was injured during Miami's surprising 24-14 Cotton Bowl victory over No. 2 Ohio State and did not play in the Fiesta Bowl. Now, it appears all three will be there to try and help derail the Hoosiers attempt to become the first 16-0 college team since the 1890s.",
      "\u201cI believe we're coming out a lot like we went into the last game,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cI know a couple guys came out of the game. Mesidor is in great condition. He hurt his elbow for a second and he's already full throttle. Ahmad Moten was full throttle today. I know O.J. came out. (Tight end Elija) Lofton will be the one that's in question. But aside from that, I feel really good about the rest. I would say OJ is good to go and (cornerback Damari) Brown is probably day by day.\u201d",
      "The Hurricanes (13-2, No. 10 CFP) may need every one of them against an Indiana team that is averaging 47.0 points in two blowout playoff wins.",
      "Defensively, the Hoosiers (15-0, No. 1) have been equally efficient, holding their last three opponents \u2014 Ohio State, No. 9 Alabama and No. 5 Oregon \u2014 to a combined total of just 35 points.",
      "And coach Curt Cignetti acknowledged that aside from losing key defensive lineman Stephen Daley to a right leg injury suffered in the postgame celebration following Indiana's Big Ten championship game victory over the Buckeyes, he expects to have all of his key players on the field next week.",
      "\u201cWe came out really good, and everybody that played in the last game will play in this game,\u201d Cignetti said.",
      "Cignetti enters the championship game with a head coaching resume any colleague would want. He's posted 14 straight winning seasons, never had a losing season, celebrated conference championships and deep playoff runs. But there's one line still missing \u2014 the same line Cristobal happens to be missing.",
      "Each is one win away from capturing their first national championship.",
      "Naturally, though, neither wants their players pressing as they take college football's biggest stage.",
      "\u201cWe've got to prepare for this game no different than we prepared for Ohio State, Alabama,\u201d Cignetti said as the Hoosiers play for their first national title. \u201cThe biggest mistake our guys can make, and I'll talk to them tonight in the team meeting about this, is making the game bigger than it is. Going down that road would be detrimental to our preparation and performance. This week is no different than any other week, we have to be on point.\u201d",

      "Finally, the winner was simply the highest-finishing driver among four remaining title contenders in the season finale. That system reached its breaking point in November when Denny Hamlin dominated the race until a late caution changed the final sequence and Kyle Larson won his second title by simply finishing ahead of Hamlin despite Larson not leading a single lap at Phoenix Raceway while mired in a 25-race losing streak.",
      "Hamlin had won two playoff races \u2014 a Cup Series high six victories on the season \u2014 and led 208 of the 319 laps at Phoenix.

I\u2019m ecstatic,\u201d Lonnie Ali, the champ's wife of nearly 30 years, told The Associated Press. \u201cBecause people, every time they look at that stamp, they will remember him. And he will be in the forefront of their consciousness. And, for me, that's a thrill.\u201d",

      "Each sheet of 20 stamps also features a photo of Ali posing in a pinstripe suit, a recognition of his work as an activist and humanitarian. Twenty-two million stamps have been printed. Once they sell out, they won't be reprinted, U.S. Postal Service officials said. The stamps are expected to generate a lot of interest from collectors and noncollectors.",

      "Lisa Bobb-Semple, the USPS director of stamp services, said the idea for a Muhammad Ali stamp first came about shortly after his death almost a decade ago. But the process of developing a stamp is a long one. The USPS requires people who appear on stamps to be dead for at least three years, with the exception of presidents.",

      "\u201cWe are really excited that the stars were able to align that allowed us to bring the stamp to fruition,\u201d said Bobb-Semple, who initially had to keep the planned Ali stamp secret until it was official. \u201cIt\u2019s one that we\u2019ve always wanted to bring to the market.\u201d",
      "Members of the Citizen Stamps Advisory Committee, appointed by the postmaster general, are responsible for selecting who and what appears on stamps. Each quarter, they meet with Bobb-Semple and her team to review suggestions submitted by the public. There are usually about 20 to 25 commemorative stamp issues each year.",
      "Once a stamp idea is selected, Bobb-Semple and her team work with one of several art directors to design the postage. It then goes through a lengthy final approval process, including a rigorous review by the USPS legal staff, before it can be issued to the public.",
      "Antonio Alcal\u00e1, art director and designer of the Muhammad Ali stamp, said hundreds of images were reviewed before the final choices were narrowed to a few. Finally, the AP image, taken by an unnamed photographer, was chosen. It shows Ali in his prime, posing with boxing gloves and looking straight into the camera.",
      "Alcal\u00e1 said there's a story behind every USPS stamp.",
      "\u201cPostage stamps are miniature works of art designed to reflect the American experience, highlight heroes, history, milestones, achievements and natural wonders of America,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Muhammad Ali stamps are a great example of that.\u201d",
      "Beyond the boxing ring, Ali was outspoken about his beliefs when many Black Americans were still fighting to be heard. Born Cassius Clay Jr., Ali changed his name after converting to Islam in the 1960s and spoke openly about race, religion and war. In 1967, he refused to be inducted into the U.S. Army, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War.",
      "That stance cost Ali his heavyweight championship title and barred him from boxing for more than three years. Convicted of draft evasion, he was sentenced to five years in prison but remained free while appealing the case. The conviction was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971, further cementing his prominence as a worldwide figure.",
      "Later in life, Ali emerged as a global humanitarian and used his fame to promote peace, religious understanding and charitable causes, even as Parkinson\u2019s disease limited his speech and movement.",
      "The commemorative postage stamp comes at a time of political division in the U.S. and the world. Lonnie Ali said if her husband were alive today, he'd probably \u201cblock a lot of this out\u201d and continue to be a compassionate person who connects with people every day.",
      "That approach, she said, is especially important now.",
      "\u201cWe have to mobilize Muhammad\u2019s life and sort of engage in the same kinds of acts of kindness and compassion that he did every day,\u201d she said.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s AI engine inside the Pentagon network",
      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\u201cVery soon we will have the world\u2019s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech at Musk\u2019s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.\u2019s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \u201cmake all appropriate data\u201d from the military\u2019s IT systems available for \u201cAI exploitation.\u201d He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \u201cWe need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\u201d",

      "Olympic officials have brought on ice master Mark Messer to prepare the speed skating rink for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games",
      "RHO, Italy -- No ice is colder and harder than speedskating ice. The precision it takes has meant that Olympic speedskaters have never competed for gold on a temporary indoor rink \u2013 until the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games.",
      "In the pursuit of maximum glide and minimum friction, Olympic officials brought on ice master Mark Messer, a veteran of six previous Olympic speedskating tracks and the ice technician in charge of the Olympic Oval in Calgary, Canada \u2014 one of the fastest tracks in the world with over 300 records.",
      "Messer has been putting that experience to work one thin layer of ice at a time since the end of October at the new Speed Skating Stadium, built inside adjacent trade fair halls in the city of Rho just north of Milan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve had in icemaking,\u2019\u2019 Messer said during an interview less than two weeks into the process.",
      "If Goldilocks were a speedskater, hockey ice would be medium hard, for fast puck movement and sharp turns. Figure skating ice would be softer, allowing push off for jumps and so the ice doesn\u2019t shatter on landing. Curling ice is the softest and warmest of all, for controlled sliding.",
      "For speedskating ice to be just right, it must be hard, cold and clean. And very, very smooth.",
      "\u201cThe blades are so sharp, that if there is some dirt, the blade will lose the edge,\u2019\u2019 Messer said, and the skater will lose speed.",
      "Speedskater Enrico Fabris, who won two Olympic golds in Turin in 2006, has traded in his skates to be deputy sports manager at the speedskating venue in Rho. For him, perfect ice means the conditions are the same for all skaters \u2014 and then if it's fast ice, so much the better.",
      "\"It's more of a pleasure to skate on this ice,'' he said.",
      "Messer\u2019s first Olympics were in Calgary in 1988 \u2014 the first time speedskating was held indoors. \u201cThat gave us some advantages because we didn\u2019t have to worry about the weather, wind blowing or rain,\u2019\u2019 he said. Now he is upping the challenge by becoming the first ice master to build a temporary rink for the Olympics.",
      "Before Messer arrived in Italy, workers spent weeks setting up insulation to level the floor and then a network of pipes and rubber tubes that carry glycol \u2014 an antifreeze \u2014 that is brought down to minus 7 or minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 to 19.4 degrees Fahrenheit) to make the ice.",
      "Water is run through a purification system \u2014 but it can\u2019t be too pure, or the ice that forms will be too brittle. Just the right amount of impurities \u201cholds the ice together,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The first layers of water are applied slowly, with a spray nozzle; after the ice reaches a few centimeters it is painted white \u2014 a full day\u2019s work \u2014 and the stripes are added to make lanes.",
      "\u201cThe first one takes about 45 minutes. And then as soon as it freezes, we go back and do it again, and again and again. So we do it hundreds of times,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "As the ice gets thicker, and is more stable, workers apply subsequent layers of water with hoses. Messer attaches his hose to hockey sticks for easier spreading.",
      "What must absolutely be avoided is dirt, dust or frost \u2014 all of which can cause friction for the skaters, slowing them down. The goal is that when the skaters push \u201cthey can go as far as possible with the least amount of effort,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The Zamboni ice resurfacing machine plays a key role in keeping the track clean, cutting off a layer and spraying water to make a new surface.",
      "One challenge is gauging how quickly the water from the resurfacing machine freezes in the temporary rink.",
      "Another is getting the ice to the right thickness so that the Zamboni, weighing in at six tons, doesn\u2019t shift the insulation, rubber tubing or ice itself.",
      "\u201cWhen you drive that out, if there\u2019s anything moving it will move. We don\u2019t want that,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The rink got its first big test on Nov. 29-30 during a Junior World Cup event. In a permanent rink, test events are usually held a year before the Olympics, leaving more time for adjustments. \u201cWe have a very small window to learn,\u2019\u2019 Messer acknowledged.",
      "Dutch speedskater Kayo Vos, who won the men\u2019s neo-senior 1,000 meters, said the ice was a little soft \u2014 but Messer didn\u2019t seem too concerned.",
      "\u201cWe went very modest to start, now we can start to change the temperatures and try to make it faster and still maintain it as a safe ice,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Fine-tuning the air temperature and humidity and ice temperature must be done methodically \u2014 taking into account that there will be 6,000 spectators in the venue for each event. The next real test will be on Jan. 31, when the Olympians take to the ice for their first training session.",
      "\u201cEighty percent of the work is done but the hardest part is the last 20 percent, where we have to try to find the values and the way of running the equipment so all the skaters get the same conditions and all the skaters get the best conditions,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

    "story": [
      "Doctors fear this week\u2019s unprecedented changes to federal vaccine recommendations will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents and ultimately lead to more illness and death among children",
      "Dr. Molly O\u2019Shea has noticed growing skepticism about vaccines at both of her Michigan pediatric offices and says this week's unprecedented and confusing changes to federal vaccine guidance will only make things worse.",
      "One of her offices is in a Democratic area, where more of the parents she sees are opting for alternative schedules that spread out shots. The other is in a Republican area, where some parents have stopped immunizing their children altogether.",
      "She and other doctors fear the new recommendations and the terminology around them will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents that make it harder for kids to get shots, and ultimately lead to more illness and death.",
      "The biggest change was to stop blanket recommendations for protection against six diseases and recommend those vaccines only for at-risk children or through something called \u201cshared clinical decision-making\u201d with a health care provider.",
      "The phrase, experts say, is confusing and dangerous: \u201cIt sends a message to a parent that actually there\u2019s only a rarefied group of people who really need the vaccine,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s creating an environment that puts a sense of uncertainty about the value and necessity or importance of the vaccines in that category.\u201d",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years, said in announcing the changes that they better align the U.S. with peer nations \u201cwhile strengthening transparency and informed consent.\u201d",
      "But doctors say they are sowing doubt \u2014 the vaccines have been extensively studied and proven to be safe and effective at shielding kids from nasty diseases \u2014 at a time when childhood vaccination rates are already falling and some of those infectious diseases are spreading.",
      "On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics and more than 200 medical, public health and patient advocacy groups sent a letter to Congress about the new childhood immunization schedule.",
      "\u201cWe urge you to investigate why the schedule was changed, why credible scientific evidence was ignored, and why the committee charged with advising the HHS Secretary on immunizations did not discuss the schedule changes as a part of their public meeting process,\" they wrote.",
      "O\u2019Shea said she and other pediatricians discuss vaccines with parents at every visit where they are given. But that\u2019s not necessarily \u201cshared clinical decision-making,\u201d which has a particular definition.",
      "On its website, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says: \u201cUnlike routine, catch-up, and risk-based recommendations, shared clinical decision-making vaccinations are not recommended for everyone in a particular age group or everyone in an identifiable risk group. Rather, shared clinical decision-making recommendations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian.\u201d",
      "In this context, health care providers include primary care physicians, specialists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and pharmacists.",
      "A pair of surveys conducted last year by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggested that many people don\u2019t fully understand the concept, which came up last year when the federal government changed recommendations around COVID-19 vaccinations.",
      "Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults knew that one meaning behind shared decision-making is that \u201ctaking the vaccine may not be a good idea for everyone but would benefit some.\u201d And only about one-third realized pharmacists count as health care providers to talk with during the process, even though they frequently administer vaccines.",
      "As of this week, vaccines that protect against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, RSV, flu and meningococcal disease are no longer universally recommended for kids. RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended for certain high-risk populations; flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended through shared decision-making \u2014 as is the COVID-19 vaccine, although that change was made last year.",
      "Shortly after the federal announcement Monday, Dr. Steven Abelowitz heard from half a dozen parents. \u201cIt\u2019s causing concern for us, but more importantly, concern for parents with kids, especially young kids, and confusion,\u201d said Abelowitz, founder of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California.",

      "Though federal recommendations are not mandates \u2014 states have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren \u2014 they can affect how easy it is for kids to get shots if doctors choose to follow them.",
      "Under the new guidelines, O'Shea said, parents seeking shots in the shared decision-making category might no longer bring their kids in for a quick, vaccine-only appointment with staff. They'd sit down with a health care provider and discuss the vaccine. And it could be tougher to have a flu clinic, where parents drive up and kids get shots without seeing a doctor.",
      "Still, doctors say they won\u2019t let the changes stop them from helping children get the vaccines they need. Leading medical groups are sticking with prior vaccine recommendations. Many parents are, too.",

      "She plans to keep having the same conversations she\u2019s always had with O\u2019Shea before getting vaccines for Zackary.",

Cisco argues it isn\u2019t liable under those laws, the 18th-century Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), first enacted in 1991.",
      "In recent years, the Supreme Court and presidential administrations of both parties have been skeptical of lawsuits seeking to use U.S. courts as a venue to seek justice over the acts of foreign governments, especially those that took place abroad. To try to overcome that skepticism, Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco\u2019s activities involving China took place in the United States.",

      "DeepSeek, a Chinese tech startup, is gaining traction in developing nations, narrowing the AI adoption gap with advanced economies",
      "HONG KONG -- DeepSeek, the Chinese tech startup that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT, has been gaining ground in many developing nations in a trend that could narrow the gap of artificial intelligence adoption with advanced economies, a new report suggested.",
      "In the Thursday report, researchers from Microsoft said global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world\u2019s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the previous three months.",
      "Yet the divide of AI adoption in developed and developing countries is widening, the report noted, with AI adoption across advanced economies growing nearly twice as fast as developing nations.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing a divide and we are concerned that that divide will continue to widen,\u201d said Juan Lavista Ferres, chief data scientist for Microsoft's AI for Good Lab, which used anonymized \u201ctelemetry\u201d to help track global device usage.",
      "Countries that invested early and consistently in digital infrastructure and AI led in terms of shares of users, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, France and Spain, according to the report. Some of Microsoft's figures overlapped with the findings of a Pew Research Center survey published in October that mapped which countries are more excited than concerned about AI. In both reports, for instance, South Korea stood out in its embrace of AI.",
      "Microsoft has a vested interest in AI adoption \u2014 its business and much of the tech industry and stock market is staking its future on AI tools becoming more widely used and profitable \u2014 but Lavista Ferres said his lab is looking more broadly at the topic.",
      "His researchers found that the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which was founded in 2023, has fueled wider AI adoption across the developing world given its free and \u201copen source\u201d models \u2013 with key components available for anyone to access and modify.",
      "When DeepSeek released its advanced reasoning AI model called R1 in January 2025, which it said was more cost-effective than OpenAI\u2019s similar model, it raised eyebrows in the global technology industry and many were surprised by how China is catching up with the U.S. in technological advancements. Leading science journal Nature published peer-reviewed research co-authored by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng in September, describing it as a \u201clandmark paper\u201d from the Chinese startup.",
      "Lavista Ferres said DeepSeek is a \u201cgood model\u201d for tasks like math or coding, but it operates differently from U.S.-based models on topics like politics.",
      "\u201cWe have observed that for certain type of questions, of course, they follow the same type of access to the internet that China has,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means that there will be questions that will be answered very differently, particularly political questions. In many ways that can have an influence on the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek offers a free\u2011to\u2011use chatbot on web and mobile, and has also given developers global access to modify and build on its core engine. Its lack of subscription fees has \"lowered the barrier for millions of users, especially in price\u2011sensitive regions,\u201d Microsoft's report said.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday indicated a jury will be allowed to decide whether artificial intelligence trailblazer OpenAI hoodwinked its billionaire co-founder Elon Musk during its evolution from a nonprofit research lab into a capitalistic enterprise now valued at $500 billion.",
      "Without issuing an official ruling, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers made it clear that she intended to reject OpenAI's motion to dismiss a 17-month-old case that Musk filed against a San Francisco startup that he helped create in 2015.",
      "\u201cThis case is going to trial,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said emphatically during an occasionally testy 90-minute hearing held in Oakland, California.",
      "The judge said she still needed to figure out some of the logistics of how the trial will be set up, as well as whether to dismiss unjust enrichment allegations that Musk has made against Microsoft, which has accumulated a $135 billion stake in OpenAI since investing $1 billion in a for-profit subsidiary that the startup created in 2019.",
      "But the judge told lawyers that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to consider in a legal showdown pitting Musk \u2014 the world's richest man with an estimated fortune of $713 billion \u2014 against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose fortune is currently pegged at $2 billion. Both billionaires would likely be summoned to court to testify under oath if the trial proceeds.",
      "\u201cPart of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said.",
      "It's unclear when the judge will schedule the trial.",
      "The case revolves around OpenAI's origins as a nonprofit research lab that Musk and Altman launched to develop artificial intelligence designed primarily for the good of humanity. That mission, the two founders believed, could serve as a foil to AI being developed by Google and other profit-driven companies that, they claimed, could deploy the technology recklessly as they strived to make more money.",
      "Musk contributed $40 million, mostly funneled through donor-advised funds that he had set up, in addition to four Tesla vehicles. Then he and Altman had a falling out over OpenAI's future, according to evidence that has surfaced so far.",

      "At that point, Musk began to suspect that Altman and another OpenAI executive, Greg Brockman, might be plotting to transform the research lab into a profit-seeking company, according to evidence submitted to the the judge.",
      "Although Altman sought to reassure Musk he remained committed to OpenAI's non-profit mission, Musk decided to cut ties with the startup and eventually launched a rival, xAI, that was valued at $230 billion in a just-completed fundraising.",
      "A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.",
      "In the diary, Brockman mused about his desire to become a billionaire and wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking that maybe we should just flip to a for profit. Making the money for us sounds great and all,\u201d according to court filings.",
      "At one point, OpenAI's own board of directors had serious enough misgivings about Altman's motives to trigger his firing in 2023 before quickly bringing him back as CEO in a comeback that Microsoft helped orchestrate.",
      "One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred. That's because there's a three-year statute of limitations on his fraud claims.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred. The trial then would be allowed to proceed to the fraud phase if it's determined that the suspected deceit began less than three years before Musk's August 2024 filing of his lawsuit.",

      "He said it is too early to tell if Mayon\u2019s restiveness would worsen and lead to a major and violent eruption given the absence of other key signs of unrest, like a spike in volcanic earthquakes and high levels of sulfur dioxide emissions.",

      "After declaring Iran was in \"big trouble\" and close to crossing a red line over its crackdown on anti-government protests, members of President Donald Trump's national security team were expected to meet at the White House on Tuesday to discuss his options for intervention in the Islamic Republic.",
      "One U.S. official tells ABC News that among the options under consideration are new sanctions against key regime figures or against Iran\u2019s energy or banking sectors.",
      "In an online post Monday, Trump said he was already prepared to impose a 25% tariff against \"any country doing business with Iran\" on \"any and all business being done with the United States of America.\"",
      "Former U.S. officials say other options likely to land on the president\u2019s desk would range from large-scale military attacks to more targeted strikes on specific Iranian leaders or police infrastructure that have helped the Iranian government allegedly violently put down protests.",
      "The U.S. also is likely to consider cyberattacks against the government, as well as online \"influence operations\" aimed at boosting the messaging of protesters online and undermining the Iranian government.",
      "\"I think one thing President Trump is very good at is always keeping all of his options on the table and air strikes would be one of the many, many options on the table for the commander in chief. Diplomacy is always the first option for the president,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday.",
      "At the same time, Leavitt said the Iran regime\u2019s public messaging is different from the private messaging being communicated to the White House. \"I think the president has an interest in exploring those messages. However, with that said, the president has shown he's unafraid to use military options if and when he deems necessary,\" Leavitt added.",
      "Mick Mulroy, an ABC News contributor who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East at the Pentagon, said the president will likely receive an intelligence assessment on the impact of a direct military strike and whether it could lead to regime change.",
      "\"I believe if they chose to move forward [on a military strike] it will be focused on regime targets specific to controlling, or oppressing, the protests,\" he said. That would include the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019\u00a0Basij forces or other internal security elements, he said, which have been blamed for the deaths of the protestors.",
      "Leavitt said Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, is negotiating directly with Trump\u2019s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. Araghchi on Monday had said Iran is \"prepared\" for war with the United States but also open to diplomatic negotiations.",
      "Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said the communication channel between Araghchi and Witkoff \"remains open\" and \"whenever necessary, messages are exchanged through that channel,\" in remarks made during a televised meeting in Tehran.",
      "He added that \"certain points and ideas have been presented by the other side,\" referring to the U.S. Last Friday, amid reports of protesters being killed in Iran, Trump told reporters that Iran was in \"big trouble\" and that the government in Tehran \"better not start shooting because we\u2019ll start shooting, too.\u201c",

      "Aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, Trump said Iranian officials had called him over the weekend to negotiate and indicated a potential meeting is in the works. \"They want to negotiate. I think they're tired of being beat up by the United States,\" he added. \"We may meet with them. I mean -- a meeting is being set up, but we may have to act because of what's happening, before the meeting, but a meeting is being set up,\" Trump said.",
      "Among those expected to be in attendance on Tuesday are Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The State Department said Rubio spoke by phone this weekend to his counterparts in France and Cyprus to discuss the ongoing protests in Iran. Rubio also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the events unfolding in Iran, an Israeli official told ABC News.",
      "The State Department has been posting in Farsi in recent days on X, including one post warning Tehran: \"Don't play games with President Trump.\" But another major military operation in Iran is considered by experts to be less likely by Trump than other options because of the risks involved.",
      "There are currently 30,000 U.S. troops deployed to the Middle East and Persian Gulf region, including 2,500 in Iraq and 1,000 in Syria. The Pentagon would likely want to move additional assets to the area to help protect those troops against possible retaliatory strikes.",
      "There are six Navy ships in the region, including three guided missile destroyers, which would be capable of defending troops against ballistic missile threats.",
      "Currently, there is no aircraft carrier in either the Middle East or Europe, with the USS Gerald Ford and its strike group currently in the Caribbean Sea after being moved there from the Mediterranean to help conduct operations in Venezuela.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\u201cVery soon we will have the world\u2019s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech at Musk\u2019s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",

      "Hegseth\u2019s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \u201cWe need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Inflation likely remained elevated last month as the cost of electricity, groceries, and clothing may have jumped and continued to pressure consumers' wallets.",
      "The Labor Department is expected to report that consumer prices rose 2.6% in December compared with a year earlier, according to economists' estimates compiled by data provider FactSet. The yearly rate would be down from 2.7% in November. Monthly prices, however, are expected to rise 0.3% in December, faster than is consistent with the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation goal.",
      "The figures are harder to predict this month, however, because the six-week government shutdown last fall suspended the collection of price data used to compile the inflation rate. Some economists expect the December figures will show a bigger jump in inflation as the data collection process gets back to normal.",
      "Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, are also expected to rise 0.3% in December from the previous month, and 2.7% from a year earlier. The yearly core figure would be an increase from 2.6% in November.",
      "In November, annual inflation fell from 3% in September to 2.7%, in part because of quirks in November's data. (The government never calculated a yearly figure for October). Most prices were collected in the second half of November, after the government reopened, when holiday discounts kicked in, which may have biased November inflation lower.",
      "And since rental prices weren't fully collected in October, the agency that prepares the inflation reports used placeholder estimates that may have biased prices lower, economists said.",
      "Inflation has come down significantly from the four-decade peak of 9.1% that it reached in June 2022, but it has been stubbornly close to 3% since late 2023. The cost of necessities such as groceries is about 25% higher than it was before the pandemic, and other necessities such as rent and clothing have also gotten more expensive, fueling dissatisfaction with the economy that both President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden have sought to address, though with limited success.",
      "The Federal Reserve has struggled to balance its goal of fighting inflation by keeping borrowing costs high, while also supporting hiring by cutting interest rates when unemployment worsens. As long as inflation remains above its target of 2%, the Fed will likely be reluctant to cut rates much more.",

      "Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020.",
      "In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

      "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025.",

      "For thousands of Venezuelans living in the U.S., the days since the Trump administration ousted Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro have brought a mixture of joy and trepidation",
      "NEW YORK -- In the days since the Trump administration ousted Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a late-night military raid, Alejandra Salima has spoken to fellow Venezuelan migrants in her role as an advocate. Like her, most voice feelings that seesaw between joy and trepidation, she said.",
      "The removal of Maduro is \u201ca first step, but we\u2019re nervous,\u201d said Salima, who fled to the U.S. three years ago with her 7-year-old son and assists other Venezuelans at the Miami office of the National TPS Alliance. With the regime that Maduro led still in place, \u201cat this moment, returning would put me and my son at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "For more than 770,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S., reactions to Trump's forceful moves in the country they left behind \u2014 and the one that has taken them in \u2014 are as intense as they are complicated.",
      "Many are thrilled by the removal of Maduro, who harassed and jailed political opponents while presiding over an economic collapse, driving millions of Venezuelans from the country. But as they try to figure out what\u2019s next for them and for families and friends still in Venezuela, many share Salima\u2019s conflicted feelings.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s move to deport Venezuelans without permanent residency has increased worry. Many were allowed to stay in the U.S. after they were granted Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, a designation Trump revoked after taking office. At the same time, the fear instilled by the government Maduro left behind makes many wary of returning.",
      "\u201cFirst, they grabbed Maduro, and I feel happy, happy, happy, grateful to the Trump administration,\u201d said Manuel Coronel, a lawyer who left Venezuela in 2017 and now lives just north of Salt Lake City. But he worries the change will be too limited.",
      "\u201cThey got him, but the criminals are still there,\u201d said Coronel, who is 54 and works at an immigration law practice. \u201cThere\u2019s no new government. Everything\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d",
      "The tensions belie assurances by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who asserted that \u201coverwhelmingly the Venezuelans that I\u2019ve heard from or talked to are excited about the changes.\u201d",

      "A new analysis of railroad accident data reveals a recurring cycle of industry opposition and federal inaction to attempts to improve safety",
      "Human errors and track defects caused more than 3,000 rail accidents over the last decade, killing 23 people and injuring nearly 1,200. Yet federal railroad regulators failed to implement most of the safety recommendations that emerged from accident investigations.",
      "That\u2019s according to an original analysis by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland.",
      "Behind those numbers, the Howard Center found, is a powerful industry that uses its money and influence to stymie federal safety reforms. It\u2019s actively lobbying President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to further reduce track inspection and repair requirements and loosen rules aimed at preventing crew fatigue.",
      "The center\u2019s analysis of data from the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates major accidents and recommends safety improvements, found it gave federal railroad regulators 81 recommendations from 2015 through 2024. The Federal Railroad Administration has only fully implemented five of them \u2014 the lowest rate of any regulatory agency in the Department of Transportation.",
      "Three of the lingering safety recommendations came out of a 2021 derailment of Amtrak\u2019s Empire Builder passenger train in Joplin, Montana.",
      "Zach Schneider, 28, was watching Montana\u2019s Great Plains roll by from the observation car of the long-distance train. Margie and Don Varnadoe, on a trip to celebrate their 50th anniversary, were walking between cars. All three were thrown to their deaths just before 4 p.m. on Sept. 25, when the train derailed, injuring 49 people.",
      "An investigation by the safety board blamed the tragedy in part on worn-down rail and other defects in the tracks owned by BNSF Railway \u2014 defects the company inspector likely missed due to his workload, according to the NTSB.",
      "But board officials went further, citing the FRA\u2019s failure to set rules for track replacement or workloads. The safety agency had already recommended both measures repeatedly after previous rail accidents.",
      "FRA spokesperson Warren Flatau said in late September that the agency currently has 102 open safety board recommendations, some dating back as far as 1998, and \u201cis currently taking action or planning to take action\u201d on more than 70% of them.",
      "He said the agency plans no immediate action on the rest, generally because officials have determined they are infeasible or can be addressed with existing regulations.",
      "The FRA didn\u2019t respond to requests for additional information on what actions it is taking.",
      "To understand why rail safety initiatives have fared so poorly, the Howard Center examined the fate of safety reforms recommended repeatedly by investigators following major accidents over years, even decades.",
      "The analysis revealed a recurring cycle of industry opposition, FRA inaction, congressional capitulation and tragedy.",
      "The three major American freight railroads included in this story \u2014 BNSF, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific \u2014 did not dispute any of the facts or findings. All sent statements saying they are committed to safety.",
      "In 1980, a train carrying vinyl chloride \u2014 the same cancer-causing chemical at the center of the 2023 East Palestine, Ohio, train disaster \u2014 derailed in Muldraugh, Kentucky, causing two carloads of the flammable gas to spill and catch fire, and a third to vent toxic fumes. Four crew members were injured and about 6,500 people were evacuated.",
      "Investigators concluded the accident was caused in part by dangerously worn-down rail, one of several types of track defects that, collectively, contribute to about a quarter of the rail accidents in the United States.",
      "The safety board called on regulators to set a limit on how much wear a rail can sustain before it has to be replaced. But the FRA never addressed the issue. An FRA-sponsored study in 1998 found such limits would improve safety, but still it took no action.",
      "In the 45 years since the Muldraugh derailment, 44 people have died and another 2,300 have been injured in nearly 15,000 main-line accidents blamed on track defects, according to the Howard Center\u2019s analysis of FRA accident data.",
      "The fatal Montana derailment occurred on one of the busiest long-distance tourist routes in the U.S., carrying more than 300,000 passengers each year between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest.",
      "NTSB officials found the rail wear limits they recommended in the 1980s would have required BNSF to replace the rail involved in the accident.",
      "A BNSF inspector had driven over the track in a company vehicle twice the week of the derailment and documented concerns about that section of track. But the inspector didn\u2019t get out to walk the tracks, something the NTSB said likely would have identified defects. There had been no reported walking inspection in nearly a year.",
      "In a statement, BNSF said it inspects its tracks in excess of federal requirements.",
      "\u201cThis tragedy is a powerful reminder that there\u2019s no substitute for robust track inspection practices,\u201d NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a statement after the investigation, imploring track owners to provide inspectors the time and resources to do their work effectively.",
      "The safety board recommended again in July 2023 that the FRA regulate rail wear. A month later, the agency said it was \u201ccommitted to working with NTSB to prevent future accidents and save lives\u201d and that it \u201cwelcomes and will consider all recommendations that will further that goal.\u201d The NTSB website showed no further response as of Dec. 18 from the FRA.",
      "Meanwhile, the industry\u2019s largest trade group is pushing to reduce human inspection requirements. In May, the Association of American Railroads, the trade group that represents the largest and wealthiest North American railroads, suggested reducing the frequency of required human track inspections in favor of additional automated inspections \u2014 a move it argued would \u201cimprove safety and reduce regulatory costs.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 5, federal regulators granted AAR\u2019s request to let railroads do just that. The FRA approved a waiver that will allow participating railroads to cut weekly visual inspections in half, provided they comply with a number of new safety and reporting requirements.",
      "The NTSB says automated inspections are a supplement to human inspections, not a replacement for them, in part because neither method is 100% effective.",
      "BNSF said use of automation allows the company to detect and repair defects more quickly.",
      "Lance Marston, a rail inspector for Norfolk Southern, said the technology excels at identifying certain track defects not always visible to the human eye, such as the rails being too far apart. But it isn\u2019t designed to detect over two-thirds of rail issues human inspectors are trained to look for, including broken rails, according to data from the AAR and rail workers\u2019 unions.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just no replacement for getting out there and putting boots on the ground,\u201d Marston said.",
      "Norfolk Southern said in a statement that automated inspection is just one part of its process and human inspectors play a \u201ccritical role\u201d in evaluating the technology\u2019s assessments.",

      "An inspector in a BNSF maintenance vehicle rode over the accident site in Joplin two days before the derailment and noted some track anomalies. But he didn\u2019t stop to look closer and missed critical defects that led to the derailment, the NTSB found.",
      "Safety board investigators surmised he probably didn\u2019t have the time. That day, he had worked 16 hours inspecting 127 miles of track \u2014 \u201can excessive amount,\u201d the NTSB said. Investigators faulted BNSF\u2019s safety culture, finding the railroad hadn\u2019t done enough to manage employee workloads.",
      "Fatigued workers, the NTSB reminded the company, make mistakes. It was a message the board had repeated since at least 2004.",
      "In the pre-dawn hours of June 28, 2004, a Union Pacific engineer was operating on less than two hours\u2019 sleep when he blew through a signal light and hit a BNSF train in Macdona, Texas. Over 9,000 gallons of liquid chlorine escaped from a punctured tank car, engulfing the area in a cloud of chlorine gas that suffocated the conductor and two local residents, and left 30 people in severe respiratory distress.",
      "The engineer went to bed late the previous night after visiting his daughter and playing cards with a friend. His first shift that weekend had ended Saturday afternoon, but only 9\u00bd hours later, he\u2019d reported for a 12-hour overnight shift, which ended just before noon Sunday. At 2:45 a.m. Monday, he was called in to operate the locomotive that would crash less than three hours later.",
      "The NTSB\u2019s investigation found the engineer\u2019s fatigue \u2014 triggered by a chronic lack of sleep, disrupted sleep cycle and long work shifts \u2014 led to the fatal mistake that caused the collision.",
      "Like many freight train employees, the Union Pacific crew worked on-call, not on set schedules. Regulators give railroads broad discretion over crew scheduling, and employees are expected to adapt.",
      "In a statement, the AAR said the \u201cdynamic\u201d nature of railroad operations \u201cpresents unique scheduling challenges.\u201d The industry, it said, \u201ccontinues to invest in tools, technology, and collaboration to support employee well-being and operational safety.\u201d",
      "But in its request to the Trump administration to roll back regulations, the AAR argued regulatory mandates aimed at preventing fatigue-related accidents are overly burdensome. The mandates, it said, create opportunities for employees to abuse fatigue-related protections.",
      "The AAR declined repeated requests to provide examples of abuse or potential abuse of fatigue-related protections by employees.",
      "\u201cIf I go back through my career as an engineer and I think about mistakes that I made, I can almost attribute all of them to fatigue,\u201d said Scott Bunten, a general chairman for the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, one of the two major rail unions.",
      "In 2006, the safety board recommended the FRA better regulate crew scheduling practices. But the agency didn\u2019t take action.",
      "Less than two years later, as part of the Rail Safety Improvement Act, Congress mandated implementation of fatigue risk management plans in the freight rail industry. It also said railroads were responsible for screening employees for sleep disorders and providing fatigue training.",

      "Fatigue-related accidents killed at least nine people and injured over 300 from 2015 through 2024, the Howard Center\u2019s analysis of NTSB investigation reports found.",
      "Railroad workers have the option to take personal rest days to avoid fatigue, but the unions argue punitive attendance policies discourage this. Crew members told the FRA as part of a 2022 study that they often don\u2019t report fatigue because they fear railroads\u2019 retribution.",

Congress eventually stepped in following a rapid succession of tragedies in the early 2000s, including one in California that killed 25 and two in Arkansas and South Carolina that released clouds of poisonous gas, killing a total of 10.",

      "Stocks of credit card companies are dropping after President Donald Trump threatened moves that could eat into their profits",
      "NEW YORK -- Stocks of credit card companies are dropping Monday after President Donald Trump threatened moves  that could eat into their profits. The rest of Wall Street, meanwhile, is showing only modest signs of concern after tensions ramped to a much higher degree between the White House and the Federal Reserve.",
      "The S&P 500 erased a small loss from the morning and was inching up by 0.1% from its all-time high set on Friday, as U.S. stocks drifted through mixed trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 81 points, or 0.2%, as of noon Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.3%.",
      "Some nervousness was still evident in the market, amid concern that the Fed may be on the path to less independence in setting interest rates to keep inflation under control. Prices for gold and other investments that tend to do well when investors are nervous rose, while the value of the U.S. dollar also dipped against other currencies.",
      "On Wall Street, the sharpest drops hit credit card companies, as Synchrony Financial fell 8.2%, Capital One Financial sank 6.4% and American Express fell 4.5%. They weakened after Trump said he wanted to put a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for a year. Such a move could eat into profits for credit card companies.",
      "But it was a separate move by Trump that grabbed the most attention across financial markets. Over the weekend, the Federal Reserve\u2019s chair said the U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed the Fed and threatened a criminal indictment over his testimony about renovations at its headquarters.",
      "With an unusual video statement released on Sunday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said his testimony and the renovations are \u201cpretexts\u201d for the threat of criminal charges, which is really \u201ca consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.\u201d",
      "The Fed has been locked in a feud with Trump, who has loudly called for lower interest rates to make borrowing cheaper for U.S. households and companies and give the economy a kickstart. The Fed did lower its main interest rate three times last year and indicated more cuts may arrive this year, but it\u2019s moved deliberately enough that Trump has nicknamed Powell \u201cToo Late.\u201d",
      "In a brief interview with NBC News Sunday, Trump insisted he didn\u2019t know about the investigation into Powell. When asked if the investigation is intended to pressure Powell on rates, Trump said, \u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t even think of doing it that way.\u201d",
      "The Fed has traditionally operated separately from the rest of Washington, making its decisions without having to bend to political whims. Such independence, the thinking goes, gives it the freedom to keep interest rates high when necessary to drive down high inflation, even if it slows the economy and frustrates politicians looking to please voters.",
      "In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly rose to 4.21%, up from 4.18% late Friday, amid concerns that a less independent Fed could lead to higher inflation over the longer term. But it later eased back to 4.18%.",
      "The worries also hit the value of the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.3% against the euro and 0.4% against the Swiss franc.",
      "Financial markets could be shaking off concerns about the Fed's independence for a couple reasons. Traders could see \u201ca limitation to the White House\u2019s success in getting its way,\u201d according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie Group, because Congress could deny confirmation of any nominees for the Fed from the White House.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A Minneapolis church opened its doors for a special Sunday service \u2014 called a service of \u2018Lament and Hope\u2019 \u2014 in recognition of the tumultuous week in a city on edge after the fatal shooting of a woman by an immigration officer.",
      "\u201cThank you for being here this morning. Gathering is such a critical, critical thing to do, especially in these times. It\u2019s been a difficult week,\" the Rev. Hierald Osorto, pastor at St. Paul's-San Pablo Lutheran Church, told a crowd seated on wooden benches.",
      "The service comes as Minneapolis has the spotlight as the latest flashpoint in President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. The Department of Homeland Security has sent roughly 2,000 agents and officers to the region in a show of force, sparking fear in the city's immigrant communities and strong opposition among activists who are pushing back loudly against enforcement.",
      "The church, which actively ministers to a largely immigrant congregation, is located in a neighborhood that has seen heavy immigration enforcement activities since Homeland Security targeted the city. It's also just 1 1/2 miles (2.4 kilometers) from the block where Renee Good was shot Wednesday by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, sending tensions even higher.",
      "In many ways it was a typical Sunday service. Candles were lit, hymns sung, and communion offered.",
      "But outside, immigration enforcement officers were actively driving through in the neighborhood, detaining people while activists blasted away on whistles and beat drums, hoping to stop them.",
      "Church security stood guard by the doors and controlled who came in.",
      "Inside St. Paul\u2019s, worshippers lit candles and greeted each other with smiles and hugs. A statute of Our Lady of Guadalupe stood at the front of the church.",
      "Church volunteers handed out pamphlets that included information on the service, the songs to be sung and the prayers that would be offered. On the front was a drawing of a woman holding a sack with the words, \u201cJustice is for Everyone: Immigrant Rights Now!\u201d",
      "The church has long been part of the community. Osorto says it began with a predominantly Swedish congregation with services held in Swedish. As times changed, the services shifted to Swedish and English, then just English. Nowadays, it's a mixture of Spanish and English with Osorto seamlessly switching between the two languages.",
      "During the service Sunday, Osorto said a prayer for Good. He said he noticed a slight dip in attendance Sunday but still, he was pleased with the turnout given all the congregation is going through.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s important for folks to realize that what\u2019s happened here in the Twin Cities has changed us for the rest of our lives,\u201d he said after the service.",

This community is important to people, and I think that you can kind of see that,\" she said. \"People in our congregation are scared.\u201d",

She said she knows people who have been picked up by ICE. She said she came here nearly two decades ago with her then 2-year-old daughter. She worries about both of them.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's photo portrait display at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has had references to his two impeachments removed, the latest apparent change at the collection of museums he has accused of bias as he asserts his influence over how official presentations document U.S. history.",
      "The wall text, which summarized Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \u201cAmerican Presidents\u201d exhibition. The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Trump taken during his first term. Now, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though the text was available online. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen Sunday, did not include any extended text.",
      "The White House did not say whether it sought any changes. Nor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions. But Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4. The Republican administration said the effort would \u201censure alignment with the president\u2019s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\u201d",
      "Trump's original \u201cportrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines. That section concludes: \u201cImpeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\u201d",
      "Then the text continues: \u201cAfter losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\u201d",
      "Asked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Trump's \u201cunmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\u201d",
      "The portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Trump is the 45th and 47th president. Similar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries such as what had been part of Trump's display.",
      "Sitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.",
      "Ingle did not answer questions about whether Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.",
      "The gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.",
      "\u201cThe museum is beginning its planned update of the America\u2019s Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\u201d the gallery statement said. \u201cFor some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist\u2019s name.\u201d",

      "Trump has made clear his intentions to shape how the federal government documents U.S. history and culture.

      "The 2026 awards season kicked off Sunday night with the star-studded Golden Globes \u2014 a ceremony known for its lively atmosphere. The 83rd Golden Globes were hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser, who returned to helm the show for a second year in a row.",
      "\"Hamnet\" won Best Motion Picture - Drama, and \"One Battle After Another\" won Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. (See a full list of this year's winners here.)",
      "Here are the highlights and memorable moments from the Golden Globes, from historic wins to powerful speeches.",
      "Nikki Glaser returns as host",
      "Glaser made history last year as the first woman to host the Golden Globes solo. This year, she took it upon herself to hand out an award for Best Editing to the Justice Department during her opening monologue, alluding to the redactions and delayed release of the Epstein files.",
      "\"I cannot believe the amount of star power we have in this room tonight. It's insane,\" Glaser said. \"There are so many A-listers, and by A-list I do mean 'a list that has been heavily redacted.' And the Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department. Yes. Congratulations.\"",
      "The comedian, who stole the show at 2024's \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" also cracked jokes about Kevin Hart's height and Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriends, and asked George Clooney to fix her Nespresso machine, poking fun at one of the actor's endorsement deals.",
      "Glaser closed out the night wearing a \"Spinal Tap\" hat and referencing several famous lines from the film directed by the late Rob Reiner.",

      "\"To my Brown sisters and little Brown girls watching tonight, our softness is not a liability,\" she said. \"Our depth is not too much. Our light does not need permission to shine. We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter, and our dreams deserve space.\"",
      "Golden Globes get political",
      "Several stars attended Sunday's award show with pins protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

      "\"Let's all do the right thing,\" Smart said. \"I think everybody in their hearts knows what the right thing is to do.\"",
      "Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne also wore pins protesting ICE.",
      "Director Judd Apatow, while presenting an award, said \"I believe we're a dictatorship now,\" and then joked that he was still angrier about losing the Best Comedy award to Ridley Scott a decade ago.",
      "New award for best podcast",
      "For the first time, an award for best podcast was handed out. The nominees were: \"Armchair Expert,\" \"Call Her Daddy,\" \"Good Hang With Amy Poehler,\" \"The Mel Robbins Podcast,\" \"SmartLess\" and \"Up First.\"",
      "Amy Poehler took home the win.",
      "\"This is an attempt to try to make a very rough and unkind world filled with a little bit more love and laughter,\" Poehler said.",
      "She also praised her fellow nominees.",
      "\"I'm fans of all of you, except for NPR. Just a bunch of celebs phoning it in. So, try harder,\" Poehler joked.",
      "K-pop takes home a win",
      "Best original song went to \"Golden\" from \"KPop Demon Hunters.\" Ejae, who wrote the lyrics and provided the singing voice for the film's character Rumi, accepted the award. As a child, she'd trained for years in hopes of becoming a K-pop star, only to face rejection, she said.",
      "\"I leaned on songs and music to get through it,\" Ejae said. \"Now I'm here, as a singer and a songwriter. It's a dream come true to be part of a song that's helping other girls, other boys and everyone from all ages to get through their hardships and accept themselves.\"",
      "\"KPop Demon Hunters\" also won Best Animated Motion Picture and was nominated for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.",
      "\"I really wanted to depict female characters the way that we know women, which is really strong and bold, really silly and weird and really hungry for food, and sometimes a little thirsty,\" director Maggie Kang said after winning Best Animated Motion Picture.",
      "What did Snoop Dogg say?",
      "The sound dropped out for several seconds when Snoop Dogg, who was on stage to present the award for Best Podcast, said he was \"high as a motherf*****.\"",
      "Teyana Taylor and Erin Doherty were also briefly censored for cursing while accepting their awards.",
      "Wanda Sykes accepts award for Ricky Gervais",
      "Wanda Sykes, who was presenting the award for Best Stand-Up Comedy, said she hoped Gervais, who was not in attendance, would win.",
      "\"If you win, I get to accept the award on your behalf,\" she added. \"And you're gonna thank God \u2014 and the trans community.\"",
      "Gervais did win in the category, and Sykes followed through on her promise.",
      "Julia Roberts gets standing ovation",
      "Julia Roberts, who was nominated for, but didn't win, Best Actress in a Drama, received a standing ovation when she presented the award for Best Motion Picture \u2014 Musical or Comedy.",
      "\"I'm going to be impossible for at least a week,\" she said. \"I appreciate that.\"",
      "George Clooney and Don Cheadle, who came onstage to present the final award for the night, joked about the standing ovation, with Cheadle noting Clooney did not receive one.",

    "summary": "The star of \"The Gilded Age\" and \"The White Lotus\" has returned to Broadway in \"Bug,\" written by her playwright-actor husband. The two talk about their on- and off-stage partnership.",
    "story": [
      "Safe to say, after recent star turns in \"The Gilded Age\" and the monologue of the year about friendship in \"The White Lotus,\" Carrie Coon is having a moment.",
      "I asked her, \"Would you agree with me that where you used to say you're at the bottom of the A-List \u2026\"",
      "\"I think I used to say, 'The bottom of the B-List,' but yeah,\" she corrected.",
      "\"But don't we need to revise our assessment as where you are?\"",
      "\"Maybe,\" said Coon. \"But the thing that's changed for me is that I was on 'The White Lotus,' and now I can be in a Broadway play. That wasn't true for me five years ago.\"",
      "The play is \"Bug,\" which opened just this past week. Coon is leveraging her newfound star power to play the demanding, harrowing lead role in this examination of paranoia, conspiracy, and loneliness. And she is adamant that her success should not obscure a larger, sadder reality of the theater these days: \"We live in a country that is fundamentally unsupportive of the arts. So now, in order to do a play on Broadway, you have to do 'The White Lotus,' or else you're not allowed. They have to replace you with somebody more famous.\"",
      "\"Hang on, if you hadn't done 'White Lotus' and 'Gilded Age' and hadn't sort of blown up as a star \u2026\"",
      "\"Yeah. We wouldn't be sitting here, absolutely not,\" Coon said.",
      "\"Your acting ability, what you do on stage, not enough?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, that's not how we make those decisions anymore,\" she said. \"And you can ask all these extraordinary theater actors who don't do plays anymore because celebrities are doing plays. It's just a different world that we're living in now.\"",
      "Tracy Letts is the playwright of \"Bug.\" He's in love with Coon's fearlessness. \"She has ice water in her veins,\" he said. \"In another life, she'd make a great assassin.\"",
      "He's in love with her acting chops. \"She's a great stage actress,\" he said. \"For the people who've only seen her do 'Gilded Age' or 'White Lotus,' they just don't know what a stage animal she is.\"",
      "Letts is in love with her. He and Coon have been married for the last dozen years.",
      "I asked, \"Your partners, your life partners, they had to be theatre people, right? Because it's such a consuming world?\"",
      "\"I came to that conclusion a long time ago that, whoever my partner was had to be in the profession; civilians just don't get it,\" Letts laughed. \"They just don't get it. It's a hard life.\"",
      "A couple of Midwesterners (Coon is from Ohio, Letts from Oklahoma), they met in 2010 doing \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago. Letts said, \"We had a palpable attraction to each other. We just wanted to be with each other.\"",
      "Coon said, \"When we confessed to our director and our castmates that we were officially together, they were like, 'Yeah. Of course.' We thought it was shocking, this shocking revel \u2013 [and they're] like, 'Yeah, hello! We've been here the whole time.'\"",
      "When the show got to Broadway in 2013, Letts won a best actor Tony. That's some impressive artistic range, considering his Pulitzer Prize for writing the play \"August: Osage County\" in 2008, and his steady presence in film and TV for the last several decades, from \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Big Short\" to \"A House of Dynamite.\"",
      "He's been around a while. Coon noted, \"Tracy's entering into sort of this \u2026\"",
      "\"Oldness?\" Letts offered.",
      "Letts is now 60; Coon is 44.",
      "\"He always gave me room to grow, because I was not in the same place in my life as him,\" Coon said. \"Like, what you're sitting in contemplation of at this stage in your life is different than where I am in mine.\"",
      "So, how does that meld? \"Oh, a lotta jokes,\" said Coon. \"Like, 'Your second husband's gonna love this couch.'\"",
      "Whether playwright and actor, or husband and wife, what makes this partnership work, they told us, is honest feedback and mutual respect. Letts said, \"She knows I'm gonna tell her the truth. She'll put on a dress and say, 'How does this look?' And I'll say, 'It doesn't look good.'\"",
      "\"No, no, no, no\u2026.\" I said.",
      "\"It's true!\" Letts reiterated. \"And she appreciates it, because she knows I'm not lying to her.\"",
      "\"Isn't rule number one of husbanding, Not bad? Which we all know means\u2026 \"",
      "\"No. We don't do that,\" Letts said. \"So when she puts on something and I go, 'You look fantastic,' or when she's in this play and I say, 'My God, you're a great actress,' she knows I'm not bulls****ing her.\"",
      "Later, I asked Coon, \"If you have something to say, whether it's praise or criticism, you know it's the truth?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Even with things I wear.\"",
      "Letts smiled. \"See?!\"",
      "While any couple might recognize that trust required to navigate life's challenges, Letts and Coon's \"moment\" is providing some uncommon tests. Take Coon landing the \"White Lotus\" role: \"I turned to Tracy and I said, 'There's no way I can go away to Thailand for six months.' We had a three-year-old and a six-year-old. And Tracy was the one who turned to me and he said, 'We're gonna figure this out.'",
      "\"Tracy was doing every morning. He was doing dinner and bedtime every night, and bath time by himself. So that was a really hard six months.\"",
      "\"I wasn't doing anything extraordinary; I was taking care of the kids while she was gone doing a job,\" he said.",
      "\"We know when the undeniable thing comes along, and we'll both make room for that to happen,\" Coon said.",
      "Which is why this chance to collaborate on Broadway is so important for them. The best way to handle a whirlwind is to find a place to anchor. For these two, that's always been the theater.",
      "\"This is where we're most comfortable,\" Letts said, \"in a rehearsal room preparing this on a stage, doing this in a theater. This is what we know. You just have a sense of accomplishment and gratification in the theater. You've told a story over the course of the night. You don't get to do that when you make a film or TV show.\"",
      "Carrie Coon and Tracy Letts are a couple now living in some of the culture's brightest lights.\u00a0 But they're theater people \u2013 bright lights don't faze them.\u00a0 \"I got my first credit card at 43,\" Letts laughed. \"It's a tough gig!\"",
      "Besides, they have work to do, the kind that's most affirming for them: Work they can do together.",
      "Letts said, \"I needed somebody who understood what it means to be an artist in America.\"",
      "\"And I needed somebody who reminded me that it was important to be an artist,\" Coon said, \"and that it was powerful, and necessary.\"",

      "Our first question to Oprah Winfrey: \"You always wear really beautiful clothes. Always have. And I wonder if it's a joy to get dressed now?\"",
      "\"I can tell you what a joy it is to actually pack clothes that you know are gonna fit and you're gonna feel good in them,\" Winfrey replied. \"I mean, it is a joy to get dressed. That is such a powerful first question, Jane Pauley, really!\"",
      "Powerful is one of the superlatives befitting Oprah Winfrey, one of the best-known and most-admired people on the planet, and one of the richest. But for all her success, she seemed powerless against a weight problem, a deeply personal struggle she has waged publicly and openly.",
      "In 1985, when her talk show, \"AM Chicago,\" was getting national attention, Oprah appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with guest host Joan Rivers.",
      "\"And I'm sitting there, and we're toward the end of the interview, and Joan turns to me and, 'So, tell me, you know, how'd you gain the weight?'\" Oprah recalled. Her response? \"I ate a lot.\"",
      "\"I was stunned in that moment, when I look back and I see that moment. But I left feeling humiliated and embarrassed, but not the least bit anger, not the least bit of anger or being upset about it,\" she said.",
      "Why? \"Because I thought, 'She's right.'\"",
      "Over the next 40 years, Oprah would gain and lose hundreds of pounds. In the fall of 1988, after a strict four-month liquid diet, a new svelte Oprah appeared wearing size 10 Calvins, weighing 145, and pulling a wagon with 67 pounds of animal fat",
      "It was all back, plus 25 more, when she went to the Daytime Emmy Awards four years later. \"And I go to the Emmys praying not to win, literally praying not to win, because I don't want to have to get up out of my seat and have everybody watch me do that walk to the stage,\" she said.",
      "She started over again the next day, working out with an on-call personal trainer this time. In 1994 she even ran a marathon.",
      "Oprah knew how to lose weight \u2026 she did it over and over. She says her body was seeking a range of 211 to 218. \"So usually, by the time I would hit 211 when I first went on the diet for the wagon of fat and pulled out the wagon of fat, when I did my first marathon, once I get to 211, I go, 'Oh, I gotta do something.' But now I understand that the biology of me, which is different than the biology of you and everybody else \u2013 every body, all of us, has our own \u2013 but no matter what I did, no matter how hard I worked, no matter what, it was always trying to get my body back to 211.\"",
      "Not because 211 is her ideal weight, but rather a \"set point\": a genetically-influenced weight range. Oprah calls it the \"enough point.\"",
      "\"Enough\" is also the title of a new book she co-wrote with Dr. Ania Jastreboff from the Yale School of Medicine, who says, for most people, an enough point is \"the weight that they kind of always gravitate to.\"",
      "So, to lose weight, you cut back on calories, and start craving high-fat food , or you eat less \u2013 but nothing changes. \"Our body's like, 'Well, if you're gonna eat less, then I'm gonna make you more efficient. I'm gonna make you burn less,'\" said Jastreboff. \"So what happens is, together, collectively, we end up eating more, and burning less.\"",
      "\"It's the enemy within, which is in our brains,\" I said. \"So, now that we know what the problem is, the hormones that drive people, why don't people just stop obeying it?\"",
      "\"That would be like trying to control something that is not in your control,\" Jastreboff said. \"That would be like holding your breath for the rest of your life. Every time somebody says, 'Just eat less, move more,' we're asking our patients to control their biology and hold their breath. And it's just not possible. And why would we do that? We don't do that for any other disease.\"",
      "And that's what the American Medical Association says obesity is \u2014 a disease. A treatable disease. But the good news is that, if it's a disease, it's not your fault.",
      "\"It's not my fault, Jane! It's not my fault,\" Oprah said. \"And I could weep right now, could weep right now. I'm not going to! But I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I journaled about this being my fault, and why can't I conquer this thing?\"",
      "In the last decade, nearly a dozen weight management drugs have been approved for chronic weight management.\u00a0 And for millions, drugs like GLP--1s are the answer to their prayers. Finally, a scientifically-supported, medically-approved weight-loss strategy that worked. And yet, Oprah resisted. \"I was so motivated by shame that I felt I could not take the drug,\" she said, \"because if I took the drug \u2013 I, who had been the poster child for I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, willpower, willpower, let's just get more willpower \u2013 if I couldn't do it, then I would be shamed, and ashamed of myself for not being able to do it myself.\"",
      "The medications don't work for everyone, and some can't tolerate side effects ranging from nausea to gallstones. But it's been two years since Oprah finally started medication, and it's working for her. She says she is now down to her marathon weight of 155. \"And so, that's it for me. I'm gonna just try to maintain,\" she said.",
      "\"Well done. Because I thought 160 was your goal weight?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, it was,\" Oprah said, \"but as I continue to work out here the combination of the medication and hiking every day and resistance training has given me the body that I had when I was running a marathon. So, I was 40 and feeling really good, but to be able to be 71 and feel that I am in the best shape of my life feels better than it did when I was 40.\"",
      "\"I would submit that you would have been a phenomenal success, but I don't think you would have become 'Oprah' if you hadn't had the weight issue and been open about it and shared it,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. I would agree with that,\" she said. \"And that's why I don't have any regrets about it. There's a wonderful spiritual, African American spiritual, called, 'I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now.'",
      "I wouldn't take nothing for my journey nowfor my journey nowfor my journey nowI wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.",
      "\"I wouldn't change the journey,\" she said. \"because I think the struggle with the weight actually helped me be more relatable and relate more to other people who were in their own struggles. But I'm glad now to be in a position where I feel the healthiest and strongest I have ever been.\"",
      "READ AN EXCERPT:\u00a0\"Enough\" by Dr. Ania Jastreboff and Oprah Winfrey",
      "\"I feel free\"",
      "Oprah Winfrey grew up riding on dirt roads. Now, on her sprawling Montecito estate near Santa Barbara, California, she owns the road.\u00a0 She took me for a ride: \"This used to belong to my neighbor,\" Oprah said. \"So, this is 23 acres. Her house used to be right there. We took this fence down, so this became my whole backyard, this.\"",
      "Around here, all of the views are spectacular, especially the one looking back.",
      "Born in Mississippi in 1954, Oprah Winfrey was a teen beauty queen who became a local TV reporter in Nashville, and then an anchor in Baltimore. \"The beautiful thing about my life was that I started out in local television, as you did,\" Oprah said. \"And when you start out locally, you get this, like, little teeny-tiny thing. But I failed. I failed in Baltimore.",
      "\"They brought me in as a 22-year-old with an anchor guy, white-haired Jerry Turner, who was the most popular local anchor in the country, not just Baltimore. And he totally hated me. He resented me. He would do everything he could to condescend to me any way. I remember one time we were on the set and he said to me, 'So, you're from Mississippi? Can you name all the tributaries of the Mississippi River?'",
      "\"And I was, like, 'All the tributaries of the Mississippi River? No, I can't.' He goes, 'Well, what school did you go to?' 'Well, I went to Tennessee State.' 'Was that an accredited school? So, you got a degree?' I mean, that kind of thing. This is in-between the commercial breaks.\"",
      "\"Boy, that happened to me in Chicago,\" I said. \"Started in September, basically was taken off the late news in the spring.\"",
      "Maybe we share a few things. I was a shy kid from Indiana who started as a local reporter in Indianapolis, and wound up on national TV \u2013 and Oprah was watching. \"You were such an inspiration. I remember calling Gayle that morning, 'Oh my God.' It just, it was unbelievable.\"",
      "\"Well, that I inspired you!\"",
      "But Oprah famously went on to build her worldwide media empire, and a following that some world leaders can only dream of.",
      "I asked, \"You have such power. Now that you are this woman undeterred by weight \u2013 'weight noise' \u2013 what are you gonna do?\"",
      "\"That's a beautiful question, but I don't feel compelled to do anything,\" Oprah replied. \"I don't know what it means actually, other than I feel free.\"",
      "And what about her name being credibly bandied about for the presidency? \"No, it's not gonna happen,\" she said. \"What I really want to do is to continue to use who I am and what that represents as a force in the world, as a force for good, and to allow people to not let the noises of the world steal their joy.\"",
      "\"You are such a person of positivity!\"",
      "\"I am indeed,\" she agreed.",
      "For all of her astonishing success, it seems that Oprah is still always aware of how far she's come \u2013 how she became something so much bigger than television. \"I have to say, there's a wonderful poem by Countee Cullen called 'Yet Do I Marvel.' And I would have to say, yet do I marvel at that, myself,\" she said.",
      "\"Sometimes in the early spring, the frogs are in the pond, and I can open the door and I can hear the frogs out at night. And it sounds just like Mississippi, being on the porch in Mississippi. But the distance from Mississippi to Montecito cannot be measured. It just cannot be measured. And I marvel at, how did this happen? How did it happen that I was able to navigate the waters of racism and sexism and misogynism and all the things that we had to endure? Yet do I marvel!\"",
      "And marvelous, it is.",
      "I said, \"We have little bits of things in common, I'm happy to say. Little bits of things.\"",
      "\"Yes. A lot,\" Oprah said, \"because we were women of this business at a time when it was really tough to be in this business. And now it's become something else. It's become something completely new.\"",
      "\"But both. It was a time that was tough to be a woman in the beginning. But boy, was the timing good!\"",
      "\"Boy, was the timing good! We made the best of it. Yes, we did.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-art-of-anselm-kiefer-becoming-the-sea/",
    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:28:07 -0500",
    "summary": "One of the world's most prolific living artists is now the subject of a retrospective in St. Louis. He talks about how rivers cutting through America's Midwest, and a Beat Generation poet, inspired his three-story-tall abstract canvases.",
    "story": [
      "Even on a casual walk, German artist Anselm Kiefer is always searching for inspiration. \"Look at this tree,\" he said walking alongside the Mississippi River. \"This is a fantastic tree, you know?\"",
      "And here in St. Louis, Missouri, it's an American river that's fired his imagination. He said, \"This river goes through America, and so with this conscience I have an inner overview of America, of the continent, of the world.\"",
      "Kiefer has turned those reflections into a series of paintings, each three stories tall. They are now holding court at the Saint Louis Art Museum, home to an Anselm Kiefer retrospective. Dozens of Kiefer works are on display, but it's these monumental canvases that are the showstoppers.",
      "The paintings depict the Mississippi and Europe's Rhine River \u2013 waterways brimming with history, symbolizing the cycle of life. Kiefer said the inspiration for their name, \"Becoming the Sea,\" came from Beat Generation poet Gregory Corso: \"Spirit is life \u2026 like a river unafraid of becoming the sea.\"",
      "\"You know, a river is something special; a river dissolves itself in the sea,\" he said. \"And it's not afraid of this. As I am not afraid of my death, you know?\"",
      "Mortality is a common theme for Kiefer. Born in 1945 in Germany, he grew up in the ruins of World War II, and the aftermath of the Holocaust. It's a chapter many Germans tried to forget. \"You know, after the war, there was not so much knowledge about what happened,\" he said. \"The Germans, they put it underneath the carpet. Nobody spoke about [it].\"",
      "Kiefer spent his career breaking through that silence, like when, as a young art student, he photographed himself giving the Nazi salute, not as an endorsement, but as a reckoning.",
      "Asked about the role of the artist in society, he said, \"If the artist is in the world, like I am in the world, as I look what happens, then automatically you have a role.\"",
      "Over the decades, Kiefer continued to explore themes of memory and loss \u2013 mostly with abstract landscapes, and materials. As Kiefer showed \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, at his studio outside of Paris, melted lead and fire are normal sightings in his work. So is a bit of chemistry, creating unexpected colors.",
      "Today, Kiefer is one of the most prolific living artists, at the peak of his career, with works selling for millions, and in museums around the world. It would be a proud moment for most, but Anselm Kiefer has always had his own way of seeing things.",
      "I asked him, \"So at 80, what are you most proud of in terms of the work you've done?\"",
      "\"You ask strange questions! I am not proud. I am disappointed!\" he laughed. \"I'm really disappointed. Because every morning I go in the studio and say, 'Oh, what I have done yesterday?' You know, and then I continue. I continue. Proud? No, no. I don't know this word for me, proud.\"",

    "story": [
      "Bob Weir, a founding member of the legendary rock band the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Saturday.",
      "\"It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\" his family wrote in a post to his Instagram page. \"He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\"",
      "In the statement, the family disclosed that Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July.",
      "\"As we remember Bobby, it's hard not to feel the echo of the way he lived,\" his family wrote. \"A man driftin' and dreamin', never worrying if the road would lead him home. A child of countless trees. A child of boundless seas.\"",
      "Weir formed the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia after the two met in 1963 as teens in Palo Alto, California. The band, with its unique mix of blues, folk and jazz, became a touring powerhouse for decades until Garcia's death in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
      "The group eventually reformed a few years after Garcia's death and took many iterations over the years, the latest as Dead & Company.",
      "\"For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\" his family's statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music. His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them.\"",
      "Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concert's for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but had a long beard like Garcia's in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",
      "\"Longevity was never a major concern of ours,\" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' Musicares Person of the Year honor last year. \"Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\"",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \"ain't no time to hate\" and \"not all who wander are lost.\"",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \"Touch of Grey,\" the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\"I venture to say they are the great American band,\" TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \"What a wonder they are.\"",

The acts allegedly occurred on the set of \"The Cleaning Lady,\" a TV series that Busfield directed and acted in.",

      "Busfield's attorney and agent did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment late Friday.",
      "The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge is for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",

    "summary": "The comic sold for 10 cents when it came out in 1938, and introduced the world to Superman.",
    "story": [
      "A rare copy of the comic book that introduced the world to Superman \u2014 and was also once stolen from the home of actor Nicolas Cage \u2014 has been sold for a record $15 million.",
      "The private deal for \"Action Comics No. 1\" was announced Friday. It eclipses the previous record price for a comic book, set last November when a copy of \"Superman No. 1\u2033 was sold at auction for $9.12 million.",
      "The Action Comics sale was negotiated by Manhattan-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous.",
      "The comic \u2014 which sold for 10 cents when it came out in 1938 \u2014 was an anthology of tales about mostly now little-known characters. But over a few panels, it told the origin story of Superman's birth on a dying planet, his journey to Earth and his decision as an adult to \"turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind.\"",
      "Its publication marked the beginning of the superhero genre. About 100 copies of Action Comics No. 1 are known to exist, according to Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect President Vincent Zurzolo.",
      "\"This is among the Holy Grail of comic books. Without Superman and his popularity, there would be no Batman or other superhero comic book legends,\" Zurzolo said. \"Its importance in the comic book community shows with his deal, as it obliterates the previous record.\"",
      "The comic book was stolen from Cage's Los Angeles home in 2000, but was recovered in 2011 when it was found by a man who had purchased the contents of an old storage locker in Southern California. It eventually was returned to Cage, who had bought it in 1996 for $150,000. Six months after it was returned to him, he sold it at auction for $2.2 million.",
      "Stephen Fishler, CEO of Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, said the theft eventually played a big role in boosting the comic's value.",
      "\"During that 11-year period (it was missing), it skyrocketed in value,\" Fishler said. \"The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it.\"",
      "Fishler compared it to the theft of Mona Lisa, which was stolen from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911.",
      "\"It was kept under the thief's bed for two years,\" Fishler noted. \"The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon \u2014 and that's what Action No. 1 is \u2014 an icon of American pop culture.\"",

    "story": [
      "The largest nurses strike in New York City history is underway after negotiators for five major hospitals and the state nurses union failed to agree\u00a0to a new contract by Monday's deadline.",
      "The New York State Nurses Association said\u00a0nearly 15,000 nurses are now walking off their jobs at five privately-run hospitals, including Mount Sinai Hospital, Mount Sinai Morningside, Mount Sinai West and NewYork-Presbyterian in Manhattan, and Montefiore Einstein in the Bronx.",
      "NYSNA said nurses at Mount Sinai started the strike at 6 a.m., while nurses at the remaining hospitals started picketing an hour later.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the strike amid worries it could jeopardize critical care for thousands of patients in the city.",
      "Montefiore said it was preparing for the strike to last multiple weeks.",
      "\"NYSNA's leaders continue to double down on their $3.6 billion in reckless demands, including nearly 40% wage increases, and their troubling proposals like demanding that a nurse not be terminated if found to be compromised by drugs or alcohol while on the job. We remain resolute in our commitment to providing safe and seamless care, regardless of how long the strike may last,\" Montefiore Senior Vice President Joe Solmonese said.",
      "A Mount Sinai spokesperson said, \"Unfortunately, NYSNA decided to move forward with its strike while refusing to move on from its extreme economic demands, which we cannot agree to, but we are ready with 1,400 qualified and specialized nurses -- and prepared to continue to provide safe patient care for as long as this strike lasts.\"",
      "Some nurses, however, did report to work despite the strike. Mount Sinai said 20% showed up on Monday.",
      "A statement from NewYork-Presbyterian said, \"While NYSNA has told nurses to walk away from the bedside, we remain focused on our patients and their care. This strike is designed to create disruption, but we have taken the necessary steps so our patients continue to receive the care they trust us to provide ... We're ready to keep negotiating a fair and reasonable contract that reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play, and also recognizes the challenging realities of today's healthcare environment...We have proposed significant wage increases that keep our nurses among the highest paid in the city, enhancements to their outstanding employer-funded benefits and new measures that reflect our shared commitment to safe staffing and workplace safety. However, good faith bargaining requires compromise from both sides.\"",
      "Mamdani joins picket line",
      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani joined picketers outside NewYork-Presbyterian in Washington Heights.",
      "\"In every one of our city's darkest periods, nurses showed up to work. Their value is not negotiable and there worth is not up for debate,\" Mamdani said. \"They show up and all they are asking for in return is dignity, respect and the fair pay and treatment that they deserve. They should settle for nothing less.\"",
      "Mamdani released a similar statement the night before the strike on X.",
      "\"This city can and must ensure the continuity of care. FDNY, Emergency Management, the public health system and all of my senior leadership are working tirelessly to ensure nurses' demands for dignity can be heard and care is still received,\" the mayor said.",
      "Mamdani urged both sides to meet at the bargaining table.",
      "\"They must bargain in good faith and they must arrive at a deal that is satisfactory to all, that allows the nurses who work in this city to live in this city,\" he said.",
      "Hochul also said she wants a deal made as soon as possible.",
      "Why are nurses on strike?",
      "Both sides bargained\u00a0throughout the weekend, but were unable to reach a deal.",
      "NYSNA has accused Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian  of putting profits over safe patient care. The union said the wealthiest hospital systems in the city are refusing to compromise on issues like pay raises, safe staffing levels, full health care coverage, pensions, and workplace protections against violence.",
      "\"Health care workers are being stretched to their limits, and as workplace violence in hospitals is on the rise, nurses are asking simply for the basics,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said at the news conference with Mamdani.",
      "Cecilia Barreto, a registered nurse picketing outside Mount Sinai West, said striking was a last resort.",
      "\"I have been here two years and I've made such great bonds with the nurses here, and I know that there are nurses who have battled cancer and depend on their health care. So we need to make sure that the health care we receive stays intact because their lives depend on it,\" Barreto said.",
      "\"Instead of guaranteeing health care for nurses, these wealthy hospitals are pushing to cut health benefits for nurses who put their own health on the line to care for New Yorkers,\" Nancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, said on Saturday.",
      "An earlier statement from Montefiore called some of the demands \"reckless and irresponsible.\" All of the hospitals impacted called the strike \"reckless\" in a joint statement, accusing the nurses of abandoning patients.",
      "\"NYSNA leadership has chosen to abandon patients in their time of need, but Montefiore Medical Center, Mount Sinai, and NewYork-Presbyterian will not. Their decision to walk out on our patients can only be described as reckless,\" the hospitals said.",
      "Some hospitals in the area were able to\u00a0reach a deal\u00a0with NYSNA, including all of Northwell Health facilities in Nassau County, while others previously pulled back their\u00a0strike notices.",
      "What the strike means for patients",
      "Gov. Hochul last week signed executive orders to ensure the state Department of Health has staff at the impacted hospitals for the duration of the New York City nurses strike, ensuring patient safety and continuity of care.",
      "Montefiore said that emergency rooms will remain open.",
      "Hospital officials said no one should delay treatment or put off appointments, but patients should be alert for any direct updates from their health care providers.",
      "NYSNA also said patients should continue to seek care, with leaders at a news conference Sunday saying going to get care is not crossing a strike line.",
      "The bottom line for patients is that the hospitals will remain open and care will continue during the strike.",
      "Some family members of patients are concerned as the strike continues on Monday night.",
      "Nurses can't pick up prescriptions at Montefiore Hospital",
      "A video shows one nurse being denied access to the Montefiore Weiler Hospital while trying to pick up prescriptions.",
      "The nurse said employees' health insurance is through Montefiore, and they can only pick up medications from a Montefiore pharmacy.",
      "\"Additionally, many nurses live in the Bronx, and their families get their care from Montefiore. If their family goes to the ER or is admitted, they're saying we can't go visit them,\" the nurse said in a statement.",
      "The woman in the video tells the security guard she is contracted to receive medications only through this pharmacy.",
      "The guard says they should've made arrangements to pick up the medication before, as they knew the strike was happening on Monday.",
      "A Montefiore spokesperson said nurses who are on strike can request their prescriptions be delivered directly to their homes.",
      "\"NYSNA nurses are able to attend any medical appointments scheduled at the medical center during the strike, as well as visit any family members who are inpatients, as long as they can provide proper documentation,\" a statement read.",

    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

      "Enough Shame and Blame",
      "My patient Alice began experiencing self-blame in childhood. Her well-intentioned mom put her on diets when she was in her early teens. Even before that, she had started to develop what she eventually called the \"self-hatred voice.\" She vividly remembers when she was ten years old, sitting in the front yard with her legs bent, seeing the inside curvature of her leg and wanting it to be smaller. \"This is the line where your muscle is, and on the inside is a curve. That's the fat and the extra skin. I thought, 'Oh, if I could just cut that off, then my leg would be perfect.' I had a pen, and I drew the line where I thought my legs should be and where the fat should be cut off. I just knew that I was larger than I wanted to be.\" Alice lived in Vermont at the time, and her mother had a garden where she grew all sorts of vegetables\u2014lettuce, carrots, cucumbers. \"I just remember eating salad, so much salad!\" Alice recalls. At thirteen, she sat at the table, thinking, \"Here's a plate with three pieces of lettuce and a carrot,\" and wondering how she was going to get through basketball practice or soccer without passing out or blowing the game for her teammates.",
      "A few years later, her mother put herself and Alice on a no-carb diet. \"Atkins was kinda big,\" Alice says. Her father and two younger brothers were exempt; it was only for the girls of the family. Which basically meant Alice and her mother were still eating everything from the garden, except no turnips, because turnips had \"too many carbs.\"",
      "After three days, Alice revolted. She reached for some crackers in the cupboard: \"Mom, I just ate an entire sleeve of saltines!\" Hearing this, her mother was not upset with her. Alice shared, \"She was desperate for carbs, too, and ate three saltines herself. And then dutifully returned to her no-carb diet.\"",
      "At sixteen, Alice started tracking her weight for sports. The self-hatred voice in her mind began to be very specific and explicit. \"The cupcake you just ate\u2014what is the number of calories in it? What is the number of carbs?\" She described that it wouldn't let up, not even for just one tiny-teeny bite. It was unrelenting.",
      "Fast-forward more than thirty years, and by the time Alice was nearly fifty, she had tried every diet and workout program under the sun: forty-seven of them, to be exact. Atkins, keto, South Beach, the Zone, low carb, no carb, ultra-low fat, liquid only, Jillian Michaels, Jane Fonda, Suzanne Somers, full-body HIIT workouts, gym memberships, a YMCA weight coach, DietBet, StepBet, a Mediterranean diet, a vegetarian diet, the raw food diet, intermittent fasting. She'd even tried hypnosis. She had three teenagers, a fulfilling job in communications, and a loving boyfriend. She struggled with obesity despite spending much of her adult life tracking every morsel of food, eating mostly healthful meals, and exercising every day. She had successfully lost weight countless times. That wasn't the issue. The problem was that she always gained it back. She always blamed herself for having obesity. She did not know about the biology of obesity, yet.",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:19:39 -0500",
    "summary": "As millions of Americans struggle with paying for health care, doctors and health experts discuss how medical care is being eroded by insurers denying necessary tests and treatment, making it \"more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
    "story": [
      "Traci Hurley says watching her husband battle cancer in late 2021 was harrowing. \"It was heartbreaking, and it was awful,\" she said. \"I lived in fear every day.\"",
      "A battle made worse, she says, because so many of the skirmishes were with their insurance company. \"No family should have to go through having to fight to get treatment recommended by their physician covered, while fighting for their lives,\" she said.",
      "Millions of Americans say they are struggling to get medical care: either unable to pay sky-high deductibles, or, like Dan Hurley, denied coverage for tests and treatment by health insurance companies. Not only were both the Hurleys doctors; Dan, an ear, nose and throat surgeon, was also skilled in cutting through insurance red tape for his patients.",
      "\"And yet, we still ran into issues a lot,\" Traci said. \"If we, as two physicians, had to struggle the amount that we had to struggle to get care approved, what about people who do not have medical knowledge? What's happening to them every day?\"",
      "Dan was an avid hiker, until a nagging backache turned out to be cancer. He was diagnosed with chondrosarcoma, an ultra-rare bone tumor. To try to save his life, the tumor, along with Dan's hip, had to be removed. Insurance only covered a portion of the costs.",
      "Traci said, \"Many of his treatments were denied. We had PET scans, we had CT scans denied. We had chemotherapy, we had radiation, we had certain medications that required prior-authorization, and were denied.\"",
      "The basis for the insurers' denials, Traci said, was that they were \"not medically indicated.\"",
      "\"Make their lives as difficult as possible\"",
      "Ron Howrigon, now a consultant, spent two decades working for health insurance companies. \"Health insurance companies know that five percent of their members account for 50 percent of all the costs,\" he said. \"So, I have this huge financial incentive to make their lives as difficult as possible.\"",
      "Howrigon says the business model is unlike other industries: \"The more your customers use your product, the less money you make. Your incentive is to keep them from using your product.\"",
      "How often do insurance companies refuse to cover the cost of medical treatments? It's hard to tell; health insurance companies are only required to report denial data for plans purchased through healthcare.gov.",
      "A CBS News analysis of about 1.3 billion federal health insurance claims across three years shows that, in 2024, insurers denied 19% of in-network claims \u2013 about 1 in 5.",
      "But for the biggest insurer, United Healthcare, that was a steep drop from the preceding two years, when it denied as many as one-third of its federal claims.",
      "While it did not provide data to support it, United Healthcare says that, across all its plans, their initial denial rate is 10%. They also point out that when employers are self-insured, the plans they choose for their employees dictate coverage decisions.",
      "\"About 165 million Americans are enrolled in employer-sponsored health care plans, and 65% of them are enrolled in what's called a self-insured plan,\" United said in their statement. \"The health insurance company they select provides administrative services such as handling calls from members and paying claims. But as the phrase 'self-insured' suggests, it's the employer's funds that cover claims payments. \u2026",
      "\"Self-insured employers can design their health plans and determine what will and won't be covered for their employees,\" United continued. \"It's important to remember that your health insurer probably isn't the one that designed it that way. Your employer did.\"",
      "\"Insurance is out of control\"",
      "Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a surgeon who sees as many as 60 patients with breast cancer each week at her RedBud surgery center in Austin, Texas, said, \"The insurance companies have, honestly, made it more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
      "She says insurance denials actually add to costs: \"I have two employees who spend almost all day navigating insurance. It seems that everywhere we turn, there's an issue, whether it's an insurance company saying, 'You know, we won't cover your surgery at that surgery center,' or 'We won't pay for that medication, we want you to be on a different medication.'\"",
      "Case in point: On an early morning this past Fall, Jeannie Lee, a 40-year-old mother with breast cancer, was being prepped for a procedure \u2013 a lymphovenous bypass \u2013 that could have been done two weeks earlier during her double mastectomy, but both her and her husband's insurance companies refused to cover the cost.",
      "Lee is at high risk for developing a condition known as lymphedema where, Potter said, \"It becomes very difficult to just use your arm. It can be painful. It's swollen. It's also deforming.\"",
      "Lee said, \"I'm 40 years old. I have three young kids. It's very necessary to do this procedure.\"",
      "Once Lee was able to obtain financial assistance through a new non-profit set up by Dr. Potter, she was back in surgery. \"This patient is having an extra surgery, a separate general anesthetic, because her insurance company wouldn't cover the surgery,\" Potter said. \"We could have done this very easily at the same time [as her mastectomy ].\"",
      "When she isn't in surgery, Potter is often on the phone defending her treatment decisions to insurance company medical directors who, she says, often know little about her area of medicine. \"Sometimes I get, you know, an ophthalmologist, an eye doctor. It was just completely absurd,\" she said.",
      "She sometimes posts her side of those conversations online.",
      "Potter: \"So, we're speaking about lymphedema of the arm. So, this is not an area that you're familiar with, correct?\"",
      "But a video she posted in early January 2025, she says, ended up putting her entire medical practice at risk. While she was in the operating room, Potter says she got a call from United Healthcare. That \"urgent\" call, she says, was to question why her patient needed an overnight stay in the hospital.",
      "\"It's never happened before. I didn't know what was going on, but they said it was urgent and I needed to call, and so I did,\" she said. \"I am operating. I'm doing the right thing for the patient. I'm going to keep her overnight. I walked out of the hospital and I just filmed myself in my unfiltered, you know, moment.\"",
      "Potter: \"It's out of control. Insurance is out of control.\"",
      "Shortly after she posted that video, she got a letter from the insurance company threatening to sue her for defamation. \"I'm taking great care of patients. They're just trying to scare me into being quiet,\" Potter told us.",
      "I asked, \"And weren't you scared?\"",
      "\"I was scared,\" she replied.",
      "United Healthcare has not taken Dr. Potter to court. They declined an on-camera interview, but a company spokesperson says the call was due to an erroneous order, and a doctor would never be asked to leave surgery for a call about an insurance matter.",
      "\"It was such a gut punch\"",
      "Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, says insurance companies know that only a small percentage of people will actually appeal claim denials.",
      "\"All of us are vulnerable to being denied,\" she said. \"Not all of us can weather the storms easily when it comes to appealing and overcoming these barriers.\"",
      "Yaver calls it \"rationing by inconvenience.\"",
      "\"A lot of people don't know that they even can appeal,\" Yaver said.",
      "I asked, \"You're saying that it's not really the denial that ends up keeping people from getting care, it's that people give up? \"",
      "\"Fewer than one percent of those in-network claim denials result in appeal, even though people were winning roughly half the time,\" Yaver said.",
      "Clearly, it does pay to appeal, but some patients, like Dr. Dan Hurley, fighting an aggressive cancer, run out of time. Much of his last months were spent, says his wife Traci, on the phone with insurance company personnel: \"He would go line by line with them and they'd say, 'Okay, yeah, we need to get a supervisor involved. We'll call you back.' And then they don't.\"",
      "Dan's goal, she says, was to see insurance companies held to a standard similar to doctors, making them liable for malpractice when they deny lifesaving care. \"The act of signing that denial is practicing medicine,\" Traci said, \"the same way, if a patient came to me and I made a decision about treatment and that decision went sideways, I'm liable. That's how it works.\"",
      "Dan Hurley died on August 3, 2023. One week later, his wife got a letter from the insurance company asking her to pay $80,000 for a round of chemotherapy that had been pre-authorized, but was suddenly retroactively denied. \"It was such a gut punch to get it that day,\" she said. \"This is unbelievable, right? Almost laughable.\"",
      "Dan Hurley's battle has become his widow's. \"There's a part of me that says, 'Oh, he would be so proud of me,' but there's also part of me that he'd be like, 'Come on, chop, chop, you got this, let's go, pick it up, don't be sad, you know, keep going.' Because that's what he was like.\"",

    "summary": "Three former Fed chairs and other top economic officials decry \"prosecutorial attacks\" on Jerome Powell, saying it undermines the central bank.",
    "story": [
      "Three former chairs of the Federal Reserve and other top former economic officials are rebuking the Department of Justice for launching an\u00a0investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, saying the probe will undermine the central bank's independence and hurt the U.S. economy.",
      "The statement, posted on Substack on Monday, was signed by former Fed Chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, as well as by former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner, Jacob Lew, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin.",
      "\"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,\" the signers of the statement said. \"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly.",
      "President Trump has pushed the Fed to more aggressively cut interest rates, arguing that the U.S. economy would benefit from lower borrowing costs.",
      "A fight over independence",
      "Powell has long defended the central bank's independence\u00a0on the grounds that shielding the Fed from political influence allows monetary policy makers to make objective decisions based on economic data, rather than the interests of elected officials.",
      "Justice Department subpoenas to the Fed threaten a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in\u00a0June 2025, Powell said in a video statement on Sunday.",
      "\"That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" Powell said.",
      "Other former senior economic officials to sign the statement: Jared Bernstein, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under former President Joe Biden; Jason Furman, CEA chair under former President Barack Obama; Glenn Hubbard and Gregory Mankiw, who both led the CEA under former President George W. Bush; Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund; ad Christina Romer, CEA chair under Obama.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve's independence and the public's perception of that independence are critical for economic performance, including achieving the goals Congress has set for the Federal Reserve of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates,\" the signers wrote.",
      "The statement signals that \"folks are unifying against this,\" Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Whether it changes the administration's mind is a tough question because it's a new source of pressure. But at the same time, it might amplify their resolve in seeing that the establishment is against this, so we must be right.\"",
      "Why Powell says he's being targeted",
      "The $2.5 billion project to renovate several Fed buildings, along with Powell's testimony about that effort, came under scrutiny by the Trump administration last year, with Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought accusing Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" project that may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "Powell had called some descriptions of the renovation \"misleading and inaccurate,\" disputing claims by the Trump administration that the overhaul included water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "In his video remarks on Sunday, Powell tied the investigation to Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed to cut interest rates and undermine the central bank's independence.",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role. The Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark rate three times since Mr. Trump's inauguration in January 2025, with Mr. Powell citing easing inflation and a slower labor market as causes for the reductions.",
      "Lawmakers across the aisle spoke out in defense of Powell. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican and member of the Senate Banking panel, said on Sunday that he would oppose any of the Trump administration's nominees for the Fed, including to replace Powell.",
      "\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, called the investigation \"nothing more than an attempt at coercion.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a speech at the National Press Club on Monday that \"Trump is trying to push out the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and complete his corrupt takeover of America's central bank so that it serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends.\"",
      "Powell's future at the Fed",
      "Powell is set to step down as Fed chair in May, but he could continue to serve as a Federal Reserve governor beyond that time. If he remains, the Trump administration would be deprived of the chance to fill another seat on the board.",
      "Powell has declined at several press conferences to answer questions about his plans. Asked on Monday by reporters if Powell planned to remain a Fed governor, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council and a leading candidate to become Fed chair, said he was unaware of Powell's plans.",
      "\"I've not talked to Jay about that,\" Hassett said.",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Trump has also called on another Fed official, Lisa Cook, to step down. Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed\u00a0as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, claimed Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "Cook remains in her position on the Fed Board of Governors after the Supreme Court in October said it would hear arguments in January about whether the president has the authority to fire her.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Monday he's imposing 25% tariffs on goods from all countries that do business with Iran \u2014 a sweeping measure as the Trump administration heaps pressure on the Iranian government amid nationwide anti-regime protests.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that the new tariffs will apply to \"any and all business being done with the United States of America.\" He said the tariffs would take effect immediately.",
      "It's not clear which countries will face the new tariffs. But Iran does billions of dollars' worth of business with one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners \u2014 China \u2014 and with the United Arab Emirates, an American ally in the Gulf region.",
      "As of 2022, the world's largest buyer of Iranian goods was China, which imported some $22.4 billion in goods from Iran, according to World Bank figures. China secretly imports Iranian oil despite tight U.S. sanctions designed to choke Iran's petroleum industry, a CBS News investigation revealed last year.",
      "China is also the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, with Americans buying $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2024, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran imported around $18 billion in goods from the United Arab Emirates in 2022. The country is one of the U.S.'s key security partners in the area, with thousands of U.S. forces stationed there.",
      "Very little trade takes place between Iran and the U.S., due to years of intense sanctions levied on Iran due to the country's nuclear program. But the sanctions on countries that do business with Iran represent a new effort to it from the global economy.",
      "The new tariffs come as Iran is swept by its largest wave of protests in years, fueled in part by the country's spiraling economy. More than 500 people have been reported dead in the protests, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly pledged to intervene if Iran's regime starts cracking down by killing protesters, and he has been briefed on options for military strikes in Iran, a senior U.S. official told CBS News.",

      "Mr. Trump has expressed a desire to cap credit card rates, something that Warren, a progressive Democrat from Massachusetts, has long supported. Late Friday, Mr. Trump proposed capping rates at 10% for one year.

      "\"While I had a chance to talk to him, I raised the question of how we reduce housing costs. We've got a bill that has passed the Senate unanimously to expand the supply of housing, but Republicans over in the House have hung it up. And Donald Trump has not lifted a finger to get that bill passed on through,\" she said.",
      "The president hasn't shared his side of the phone call.",

In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.",
      "The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of President Trump.

      "Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick's experience in global finance, \"combined with her deep relationships around the world,\" made her \"uniquely suited to help Meta\" in its future growth.",

    "summary": "Economists say high home prices and a shortage of available properties may limit how much federal action can lower U.S. housing costs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump last week proposed two policies aimed at reducing the cost of buying a home, as soaring prices and elevated mortgage rates make homeownership increasingly unattainable for many Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump said he plans to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, and is also directing the federal government to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds to drive down mortgage rates for Americans.",
      "\"It is one of my many steps in restoring Affordability,\" Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 8 social media post of the proposed mortgage debt purchase.",
      "Buying a home has become far more expensive in recent years as home prices have surged, driven by a shortage of affordable housing and, since 2022, rising mortgage rates. But because many of those pressures lie beyond the federal government's direct control, it's unclear how much Mr. Trump's proposals could ultimately lower costs, according to experts.",
      "America's housing shortage",
      "Mr. Trump's approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes from institutional investors. Yet experts say these strategies will do little to address one of the housing market's thorniest problems: a shortage of homes for sale.",
      "The supply issue partly reflects years of underbuilding after the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the reluctance of homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during the ensuing recession to relinquish their properties.",
      "\"There is an undersupply of housing in the U.S., and that will take time to resolve,\" Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy for TD Securities, told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address the housing shortage, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of housing and communities at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News that the housing market's supply challenges could be harder to address.",
      "\"Most solutions to create new housing take a long time to come to fruition,\" she said.",
      "For example, high land costs make it hard to add to the housing supply. One solution, \u00a0Ratcliffe said, would be to change local zoning rules so more homes can be squeezed into a given area. Yet such policies are set at the local level, not by the federal government, she noted.",
      "Why lower mortgage rates aren't a panacea",
      "Because Mr. Trump's policies address the demand side of the equation, they could inadvertently drive up home prices, Goldberg said. For instance, a decline in mortgage rates could draw more buyers into the market, pushing home prices higher and exacerbating the supply problem.",
      "\"If consumers are able to afford more homes because monthly payments are lower, home prices tend to rise more quickly,\" the analyst told CBS News. \"So simply lowering the cost of buying a home through the mortgage channel isn't sufficient to fix the problem in the long run.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's plan to ban big investors, such as Invitation Homes and financial giant Blackstone, from hoovering up single-family homes might have only a limited effect on the market, according to Goldberg. The reason: investors that own at least 100 properties account for only roughly 1% of the total single-family housing stock in the U.S., according to the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"That's a relatively small impact,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Mr. Trump also hasn't said whether institutional investors would be required to sell the homes they currently own, he pointed out. If those firms are not forced to put those properties on the market, a ban is unlikely to significantly expand the supply of homes, Goldberg said.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump's policies could make a small difference, some housing market experts said.",
      "\"Mortgages will be a little cheaper, and housing will be a little more affordable,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, told CBS News, adding that banning institutional investors from scooping up homes could \"bring prices down a little.\"",
      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points, which could \"spur more spending activity.\"",
      "The upshot: Meaningful progress will require tackling the shortage of available homes, economists agreed. Unless that issue is addressed, the housing affordability crunch will persist, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "\"We need to either activate the existing supply that is underutilized, or take steps to allow the building of new homes,\" Pinto said. \"We need to come up with supply-side solutions that take effect quickly.\"",

      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Mattel is introducing a Barbie with autism as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity.",
    "story": [
      "Mattel Inc. is introducing a Barbie with autism Monday as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity, joining a collection that already includes Barbies with Down syndrome, a blind Barbie, a Barbie and a Ken with vitiligo, and other models the toymaker added to make its fashion dolls more inclusive.",
      "Mattel said it developed the doll over more than 18 months in partnership with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates for the rights and better media representation of people with autism. The goal: to create a Barbie that reflected some of the ways people with autism may experience and process the world around them, according to a Mattel news release.",
      "That was a challenge because autism encompasses a broad range of behaviors and difficulties that vary widely in degree, and many of the traits associated with the disorder are not immediately visible, according to Noor Pervez, who is the Autistic Self Advocacy Network's community engagement manager and worked closely with Mattel on the Barbie prototype.",
      "Like many disabilities, \"autism doesn't look any one way,\" Pervez said. \"But we can try and show some of the ways that autism expresses itself.\"",
      "For example, the eyes of the new Barbie shift slightly to the side to represent how some people with autism sometimes avoid direct eye contact, he said. The doll also was given articulated elbows and wrists to acknowledge stimming, hand flapping and other gestures that some people with autism use to process sensory information or to express excitement, according to Mattel.",
      "The development team debated whether to dress the doll in a tight or a loose-fitting outfit, Pervez said. Some people with autism wear loose clothes because they are sensitive to the feel of fabric seams, while others wear figure-hugging garments to give them a sense of where their bodies are, he said.",
      "The team ended up choosing an A-line dress with short sleeves and a flowy skirt that provides less fabric-to-skin contact. The doll also wears flat shoes to promote stability and ease of movement, according to Mattel.",
      "Each doll comes with a pink finger clip fidget spinner, noise-canceling headphones and a pink tablet modeled after the devices some people with autism who struggle to speak use to communicate.",
      "The addition of the doll with autism to the Barbie Fashionistas line also became an occasion for Mattel to create a doll with facial features inspired by the company's employees in India and mood boards reflecting a range of women with Indian backgrounds. Pervez said it was important to have the doll represent a segment of the community of people with autism that is generally underrepresented.",
      "Mattel introduced its first doll with Down syndrome in 2023 and brought out a Barbie representing a person with Type 1 diabetes last summer. The Fashionistas also include a Barbie and a Ken with a prosthetic leg, and a Barbie with hearing aids, but the line also encompasses tall, petite and curvy body types and numerous hair types and skin colors.",
      "\"Barbie has always strived to reflect the world kids see and the possibilities they imagine, and we're proud to introduce our first autistic Barbie as part of that ongoing work,\" Jamie Cygielman, Mattel's global head of dolls, said in a statement.",
      "The doll was expected to be available at Mattel's online shop and at Target stores starting Monday for a suggested retail price of $11.87. Walmart stores are expected to start carrying the new Barbie in March, Mattel said.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year that the estimated prevalence of autism among 8-year-old children in the U.S. was 1 in 31. The estimate from the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network said Black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander children in the U.S. were more likely than white children to have a diagnosis, with the prevalence more than three times higher among boys than girls.",

    "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:57:08 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issuers in the U.S. for comment.",
      "Supporters point to trillions in credit card debt",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, the highest level on record, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found in 2023 that credit card rates have soared \"far above the cost of offering credit.\"",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "Opponents argue a credit card rate cap could backfire",
      "Opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "A coalition of groups that represent banks \u2014 including the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute \u2014 argued in a statement to CBS News on Friday that a 10% interest rate cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.\"",
      "The Bank Policy Institute estimated last year that more than 14 million American households that rarely pay their credit card balances in full could have their access to credit eliminated or curtailed by a 10% cap. Millions of people who sometimes pay off their balances could also face new restrictions, the group said.",
      "The American Bankers Association has\u00a0argued in the past that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people who are in need of loans would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" that often charge even higher rates, like payday lenders and pawn shops.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "Ackman later wrote: \"Finding a way to bring down credit card rates without taking credit away from many Americans would have a very positive impact on the most disadvantaged Americans.\"",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "Trump pledges to deal with affordability",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has said Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and sold American oil.\" But the history between the countries is far more complicated, experts note.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife on Saturday, he justified the military operation in part by framing it as a move to recover assets that he claims had been stolen from U.S. companies.",
      "\"Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\"",
      "Who owns Venezuela's oil?",
      "The president's focus on Venezuela's oil is now raising questions about American energy companies' activities in the country, as well as whether U.S. oil giants might now work to revive its floundering petroleum industry. Venezuela's\u00a0constitution\u00a0states that the nation owns all mineral and hydrocarbon deposits \u2014 its oil and natural gas reserves \u2014 within its own territory, including those that lie beneath the country's seabed.",
      "Mr. Trump \"talks about them taking our oil \u2014 the oil itself was never 'our oil',\" Samantha Gross, director of the energy security and climate initiative at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CBS News, adding that the nation's vast crude reserves \"belong to the government of Venezuela.\"",
      "What's also true, however, is that U.S. oil companies had contractual agreements with Venezuela to extract, process and transport its oil, as well as to share in the revenue from oil sales.",
      "Mr. Trump's claims of theft reflect actions by then-Venezuela leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to nationalize the nation's energy sector in 2007 and to confiscate the production assets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips after they left the country, Gross said.",
      "Those seizures have led to years of lawsuits and efforts by the companies to recoup their losses. While a World Bank arbitration panel has ruled in favor of the oil companies, the money has yet to be recovered.",
      "\"It is beyond question that there are a number of U.S. companies and others out there who have claims against Venezuela that have been trying to get those claims satisfied for many years,\" Ted Posner, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former assistant general counsel for international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told CBS News.",

Representatives from Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips attended, including ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance.",
      "\"ConocoPhillips continues to monitor developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,\" the company said in a statement prior to the meeting.",
      "Said a Chevron spokesperson after the meeting on Friday: \"For more than a century, Chevron has been a part of Venezuela's past. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security.\"",
      "Exxon didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's power play \u2014 and corruption",
      "Venezuela's government has a long history of nationalizing its oil sector, with state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, taking over the industry in the 1970s. Exxon and other foreign oil companies continued to operate in the country by signing contracts to provide technical assistance and other expertise to PDVSA.",
      "In the 1990s, Exxon and other large petroleum companies were invited by then-Venezuelan President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez to return in an effort to develop the oil reserves in the Orinoco River Basin, according to \"Energy in the Americas,\" a book published by the University of Calgary Press.",
      "But in 2003, Ch\u00e1vez fired thousands of PDVSA workers after they went on strike. Four years later, he expanded the nationalization push by requiring foreign companies to give majority ownership of their ventures to PDVSA. Exxon and ConocoPhillips failed to strike a deal with Venezuela, while BP, Houston-based Chevron, Norway's Statoil and France's Total signed pacts giving majority stakes to PDVSA, allowing them to remain, Reuters reported in 2007.",
      "\"Some agreed, and some did not, and assets were expropriated,\" Gross said.",
      "Amid widespread corruption under Ch\u00e1vez, as journalist Anne Appelbaum noted in a 2024 book, hundreds of billions of dollars were siphoned off from PDVSA and other Venezuelan companies and subsequently disappeared into private bank accounts around the world.",
      "A 2017 investigation by U.S. and Portuguese authorities found that PDVSA executives had funneled millions of dollars into Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo.",
      "Venezuela owes billions to Big Oil",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's strong-arm tactics led to efforts by Exxon and ConocoPhillips to seek compensation for their assets, with Exxon claiming it had lost $16.6 billion due to the nationalization campaign. A World Bank arbitration panel in 2014 awarded the company one-tenth of what it had sought, but that same body later\u00a0annulled most of that award.",
      "In a separate case, an international tribunal\u00a0ruled that Venezuela owed $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for the 2007 seizure of its assets.",
      "Other industries also had their assets taken away under Ch\u00e1vez's 14-year reign, and companies have filed at least 60 arbitration claims against Venezuela since the 2000s, according to Luisa Palacios, an adjunct senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.",
      "\"The value of these liabilities is estimated at $20 to $30 billion or about 10% to 15% of the almost $200 billion in international debt obligations Venezuela owes,\" she said in an article this week published by Columbia.",
      "\"Venezuela could pay off these claims by inviting investors back to the country,\" she noted. \"That could be done through debt-for-equity swaps or by linking future oil production to repayment of current debts. However, restructuring the country's foreign obligations will likely be needed for Venezuela to fully realize its oil potential.\"",
      "U.S. wasting no time",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves\u00a0are estimated to be the world's largest, with more than 303 billion barrels. That represents about 17% of the world's total oil supply, according to OPEC\u00a0data.",
      "But Venezuela's crude oil production has plunged, with the industry today pumping 800,000 to 1 million barrels per day, down from more than 3 million per day in the early 2000s. That output has nosedived due to chronic underinvestment, government mismanagement, and the impact of U.S. and international sanctions.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at \"market rates,\" with revenue used \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil.",
      "Although Mr. Trump is pushing U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela following Maduro's capture, they may need assurances before committing to new ventures, Gross said.",
      "\"The political situation in Venezuela is really uncertain right now. Before a company is going to realistically invest a lot of money, they will want a stable political situation,\" she added.",

      "\"The labor market has shown continued resiliency, but it's still softening, and the pace of year-to-date overall employment gains has slowed to the dragging pace of growth we saw in 2020,\" said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management, in a Friday email.",

Employers added a total of roughly 584,000 jobs in 2025, down sharply from more than 2 million the previous year and the weakest annual gain outside a recession since 2003, according to Oxford Economics.",

      "Payroll gains averaged about 50,000 per month last year, according to BLS\u00a0data, which is the amount the economy requires to maintain a stable labor market, according to Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, which aligns with the December job gains and the average payroll gains throughout 2025.",
      "Interest rate outlook",
      "Signs of stabilization in the labor market \u2014 particularly a lower jobless rate \u2014 could lead the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes on interest rate cuts for now, according to some experts.",
      "\"For this report, all roads lead to the unemployment rate,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. Economic Research at Fitch Ratings, in an email. \"At 4.4%, it simply reads as relief versus 4.6% and it should douse the Fed's recent urgency to backstop a weakening labor market.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is tasked with maintaining strong hiring while also taming inflation. A weaker labor market picture in 2025 compelled the central bank to cut interest rates three times.",
      "The upshot for 2026, experts say, is that rate cuts are coming, but they may arrive later in the year.",

      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",

      "Avelo Airlines said that it will no longer carry out migrant deportation flights for the Department of Homeland Security, ending a contract that supported the U.S. government's immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "The Houston-based carrier, founded in 2021, said its deal to handle Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights did not sufficiently boost the airline's financial position. As a result, the low-cost carrier is shutting down its hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where its migrant flight operation was based, the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Avelo will close the base at [Mesa Gateway Airport] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,\" an Avelo spokesperson said. \"The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.\"",
      "Avelo operates low-cost flights to dozens of destinations, including the Caribbean, from four U.S. hubs. It is planning to open a fifth base in Dallas in late 2026.",
      "DHS has long partnered with CSI Aviation, which subcontracted with Avelo to provide ICE with air charter services. The federal agency also subcontracts with other charter companies, including GlobalX, which handled more than half of DHS' charter flights in 2025, according to ICE Flight Monitor at Human Rights First, a group that tracks ICE deportation flights.",
      "\"ICE never contracted directly with Avelo Airlines,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News. \"ICE will continue to utilize its contracted service provider, which works with multiple airlines to support the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "In April, Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy expressed confidence that the airline's deportation business would help drive the carrier's growth, while conceding that handling deportation flights was a \"sensitive and complicated topic.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump says he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he said would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Thursday that he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he argued would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
      "Mr. Trump and the White House have been trying to show they are responding to voter concerns about affordability ahead of midterm elections in November. Home prices have generally risen faster than incomes because of a persistent construction shortfall, making it harder for renters to buy their first home and for existing owners to upgrade to a new property \u2014 a challenge that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and the recovery from the housing market collapse that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "Mr. Trump last month said he planned to unveil housing reforms \u2014 and on Wednesday, he announced that he\u00a0wants to block institutional investors from buying houses.",
      "The president said Thursday that the two mortgage giants under government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have $200 billion in cash that will be used to make the mortgage bond purchases.",
      "\"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "Federal Housing Finance Authority Director Bill Pulte, who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said on X the two government-run companies \"will be executing\" the president's request.",
      "The Federal Reserve has, in the past, bought mortgage bonds during times of economic turmoil in order to help reduce interest rates, leading many homeowners to refinance into rates of 3% or less. The low rates of the recent past make these homeowners reluctant to sell their properties, depriving the market of inventory.",
      "Additional mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie could temporarily help lower mortgage costs, but that approach also could have unintended consequences, according to TD Securities analysts.",
      "\"We see this succeeding in the short term, though we believe it will reignite home prices' inflation given supply constraints,\" they said in a research note, alluding to a severe shortage of affordable housing in the U.S.",
      "Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate brokerage Redfin, estimated to the Associated Press that the government purchases of mortgage debt could shave 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points off the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. But she also cautioned that the purchases wouldn't address other factors driving high housing costs, like limited supply.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the\u00a0U.S. are unaffordable\u00a0for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site. Property data firm ATTOM found Thursday that in the last three months of 2025, median-priced single-family homes were less affordable than historical averages in 99% of the nearly 600 U.S. counties the company analyzed.",
      "Mortgage rates have been averaging around 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, which went into federal conservatorship along with Fannie Mae in 2008 when the U.S. economy crashed during the Great Recession. Thirty-year mortgage rates haven't been below 6% since September 2022.",
      "Mortgage rates began to climb as inflation spiked coming out of the global pandemic, with the consumer price index hitting a four-decade high in 2022. The average mortgage rate is down from nearly 7% at the start of Mr. Trump's second term last year, yet the decrease has done little to reassure a public that feels pressure from the costs of housing, food and energy.",
      "When interest rates fall it can become cheaper to service housing debt on a monthly basis. The reduced monthly payments can improve affordability for a period until home prices adjust in response to changes in the rates. There was roughly $21.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt as of the middle of last year, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.",
      "Many homeowners took advantage of low interest rates during the pandemic to refinance their mortgages at rates of 3% or lower.",
      "The plan to buy up hundreds of billions in mortgage bonds could also carry some risk for Fannie and Freddie because Mr. Trump would be spending the cash reserves that are supposed to help be a buffer against an economic downturn akin to what happened during the Great Recession. In a sense, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could be more vulnerable if anything negative happens to the housing market, meaning Mr. Trump is betting that possibility is highly unlikely.",
      "Fannie and Freddie work by buying up scores of residential mortgages and repackaging them as mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors. Collectively, they guarantee trillions of dollars' worth of mortgages.",
      "In the past, the president has pushed to take Fannie and Freddie public. Supporters argue that move could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, but critics warn it may push up mortgage rates by raising uncertainty about the two megafirms.",
      "But on Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to rethink that plan, writing: \"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount \u2014 AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE \u2014 and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH.\"",

      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",

      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",

      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section.

    "summary": "A change at the U.S. Postal Service could pose an issue for people who need to get bills, taxes and other mail postmarked by specific dates.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Postal Service said some mail might no longer receive a same-day postmark, the result of cost cuts to its transportation operations that may delay the arrival of posted letters at its processing facilities.",
      "The change could prove a stumbling block for people who need to ensure that mail such as bill payments, taxes or voting ballots are postmarked by specific dates. For instance, state and federal quarterly estimated taxes typically must be postmarked by January 15, April 15, June 15 and September 15 to avoid late fees.",
      "The change is part of the postal agency's 10-year plan to reduce costs and restore profitability. USPS' loss narrowed slightly in its most recent fiscal year, shrinking from $9.5 billion in 2024 to\u00a0$9 billion last year, but it continues to struggle with high costs and dwindling mail volumes.",
      "\"[W]e have made adjustments to our transportation operations that will result in some mailpieces not arriving at our originating processing facilities on the same day that they are mailed,\" the USPS said in a Jan. 2 post on its site.",
      "The agency's 10-year reorganization plan includes an overhaul of its regional transportation system, reducing the number of USPS vehicle trips for transporting mail from post offices to processing plants, where mail is postmarked, sorted and routed.",
      "That means postmarks applied at the USPS's processing facilities \"will not necessarily match the date on which the customer's mailpiece was collected by a letter carrier or dropped off at a retail location,\" the agency said.",
      "How to ensure a same-day postmark",
      "People who want to ensure their mail is postmarked with a specific date should ask USPS clerks at a branch counter to manually place a postmark on the letter or package, a USPS spokeswoman told CBS News.",
      "\"The Postal Service also offers certified mail or registered mail service at the Post Office retail counter for purchase. If a mailer purchases these services, the mailer will get a receipt that includes tracking information,\" she added.",
      "While the public, government agencies and businesses have long relied on postmarks to determine when mail was posted, the USPS said in its Jan. 2 post that the postmark \"is not and has not been a service that the Postal Service has provided to the public for such purposes.\"",

    "story": [
      "Taxpayers eager to receive their tax refunds should mark Jan. 26, 2026, on their calendars, as the IRS said Thursday it will begin accepting federal income tax filings on that date.",
      "Annual tax refunds are typically the largest checks that households receive each year, with last year's average payment amounting to almost $3,200, according to IRS data. This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check set to increase by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis.",
      "2025 tax returns will be impacted by a number of major changes signed into law through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act, which enacted a host of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025. These include eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "Federal income tax returns are due April 15, although people who need more time can file for an\u00a0automatic tax extension before that. An extension gives taxpayers until Oct. 15 to file, although any taxes owed must still be paid by April 15 to avoid penalties.",
      "When will you get your refund?",
      "The question on most taxpayers' minds is how long it will take for their refund to be deposited.",
      "That depends on whether a taxpayer files electronically or submits a paper return, as well as whether the IRS identifies any problems with a filing.",
      "People who file electronically typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. That means a taxpayer who files a Form 1040 on Jan. 26 could receive a refund by Feb. 16, assuming there are no issues with the return.",
      "Filers can use the IRS' \"Where's My Refund\" tool to check the status of their return, with the agency typically providing information about 24 hours after an electronic filing.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. trade deficit dropped sharply in October, reaching its lowest level since 2009 as imports dropped under President Trump's sweeping tariffs, according to new government data.",
      "The overall trade gap plunged 39% to $29.4 billion in October, as imports fell by 3.2%, Department of Commerce figures show. The deficit was significantly lower than the $58.4 billion median forecast from surveys of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.",
      "While U.S. exports rose by $7.8 billion in October to $302 billion, imports dropped by $11 billion to $331.4 billion. The U.S. trade deficit in September was $48.1 billion.",
      "\"Swings in trade of gold and pharmaceuticals were behind the plunge in the trade deficit to a two-decade low in October, though higher computer imports suggest there are genuine signs of strength elsewhere in the economy amid the AI buildout,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "The release of the trade data was delayed by more than a month due to a 43-day\u00a0government shutdown last year, depriving officials and companies of updated figures as they assess the health of the world's biggest economy.",
      "The figures underscore how Mr. Trump's volatile and sweeping tariff policies have influenced trade flows. When the president unveiled wide-ranging tariffs on imports from dozens of trading partners, U.S. businesses rushed to stock up on inventory, front-loading imports ahead of planned tariff hikes.",
      "This has allowed many firms to avoid passing on the full cost of tariffs to consumers, keeping price hikes on goods relatively tame.",
      "As U.S. households grapple with an affordability crisis, Mr. Trump has more recently expanded the range of\u00a0goods exempt from tariffs, including key agricultural imports.",
      "As of mid-November, the Budget Lab at Yale University estimated that consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate topping 16%, the highest since the 1930s.",

      "President Trump said on Wednesday that he will take steps to prevent institutional investors from buying single-family homes, claiming the move would help make housing more affordable for Americans.",
      "In a social media\u00a0post, Mr. Trump said that the dream of home ownership has become increasingly out of reach for many Americans, and that action is needed to allow more people to reach the milestone of owning a residence.",
      "\"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"People live in homes, not corporations.\"",
      "He added that he will provide more details about the proposal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month.",
      "The White House declined to provide more information on Mr. Trump's plans for restricting large investors from acquiring homes.",
      "Shares of major home leasing and management companies fell sharply immediately after Mr. Trump's announcement. Invitation Homes' stock price slid more than 7%, while American Homes 4 Rent dropped 6.3%. Investment giant Blackstone, which also owns and rents homes, sank more than 4%.",
      "\"It is an idea that appeals to MAGA populists and is a policy that Vice President J.D. Vance has consistently supported,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen, said in a research note. \"That it comes now is an indicator of how worried Team Trump is worried about the impact of housing affordability on the midterm election.\"",
      "Seiberg expects both the House and Senate to pass bipartisan bills to implement Mr. Trump's order. \"We appreciate that many important congressional Republicans have opposed this in the past. Our view is that they will concede on this issue rather than fight the president,\" he added.",
      "Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "The analysis also noted that institutional ownership varies nationwide, reaching 4.2% in Atlanta, 2.6% in Dallas and 2.2% in Houston. But these investors tend not to dominate neighborhoods, even if they're generally more concentrated in lower- and middle-income communities.",
      "Impact on home prices and rent",
      "Still, the recent rise of institutional investors purchasing single-family homes can have negative spillover effects for consumers, research shows.",
      "In 2024, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0found that institutional investment can increase rents and home prices, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Advocates for policies benefiting property owners said they would support policies that block large investors from scooping up properties.",
      "\"We are very glad to see that the administration is squarely focusing on housing and housing affordability,\" Colin Allen, executive director of the American Property Owners Alliance,\u00a0 a nonpartisan advocacy group, told CBS News. \"Each home that is taken off the market by an institutional investor is one less for an owner-occupant to try to move into at a time when there is a lot of competition for homes for sale.\"",
      "More than 75% of homes across the U.S. are unaffordable for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site.",
      "Data from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of home purchases in 2024 were made by first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010. Housing economists also point to a severe shortage of inventory for the soaring cost of homes in recent years.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts in October estimated the U.S. would need to add 3 million to 4 million homes above the normal pace of construction levels to help ease residential real estate prices.",
      "A better solution?",
      "Some experts are skeptical that Mr. Trump's proposal to restrict investor ownership of single-family homes would help ease housing costs for Americans.",
      "Institutional investors contribute to the housing supply by buying and renovating derelict homes, and then putting them back on the market, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "A ban on real estate trusts, private equity firms and other housing market investors from buying homes could also have unintended consequences by discouraging such players from selling their existing properties, he added.",
      "A better way to create affordable housing, Pinto said, is to make more efficient use of the nation's existing housing stock by allowing homeowners to rent out unused rooms tax-free, and also by incentivizing states to build more homes.",

      "But Fisher's lawyers say Boeing's attempts to deflect liability in past lawsuits despite what the NTSB investigation found led to the pilot being sued by some passengers and caused him great distress. Still, experts say it's unusual for a pilot to sue like this in an incident where he wasn't seriously hurt or killed. Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit says Boeing suggested it wasn't responsible because the plane was \"improperly maintained or misused\" by others.",
      "\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummolo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court.",
      "Key bolts were missing",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The bolts are hidden behind interior panels in the plane, so they are not something that could have been easily checked in a preflight inspection by the pilot or anyone else from the airline. NTSB investigators determined the door plug was gradually moving upward over the 154 flights prior to the incident before it ultimately flew off.",
      "\"Boeing's lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\" Fisher's lawyers wrote. \"Because he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing's attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\"",
      "The NTSB made clear this was caused by a manufacturing issue and the crew's actions were exemplary. Experienced pilot John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems aviation safety consulting firm, said the crew did a remarkable job considering what they were dealing with, and no one has faulted the crew.",
      "\"I think the Boeing lawyers were kind of grasping at straws,\" Cox said.",
      "Terrifying moments",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane landed safely.",
      "\"The first indication was an explosion in my ears and then a whoosh of air,\" First Officer Emily Wiprud told CBS News in an exclusive interview in 2024. \"My body was forced forward and there was a loud bang as well. ... The flight deck door was open. I saw tubes hanging from the cabin.\"",
      "Wiprud said that at that point, she didn't know what was wrong. Instinct took over, and she and the captain started working to land safely.",
      "\"I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,\" Wiprud said. \"I knew something was catastrophically wrong.\"",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot piece of fuselage covering an unused emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "A teen aboard the flight\u00a0had his shirt ripped off his body.\u00a0 Multiple objects, including the\u00a0phones of two passengers, Wiprud's headset and multiple aircraft components, were sucked out of the aircraft.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs they weren't qualified for.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit describes how he and the first officer acted quickly after losing cabin pressure when the panel blew out to fly the plane safely back to Portland while decreasing altitude and working with air traffic controllers to avoid any other planes in the area.",
      "The airline didn't answer a question about whether Fisher is still flying for them, and the lawsuit described him as a citizen and well-respected member of the aviation community. It wasn't clear Tuesday whether he is still working as a pilot.",
      "Working to improve safety",
      "The head of the commercial airplane unit at Boeing at the time, Stan Deal, commended the Alaska Airlines crew for safely landing the plane in a memo to employees after the incident.",
      "Boeing did not comment directly on this new lawsuit. But the company's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has made improving safety a top priority ever since he took over the top job at Boeing in August 2024.",
      "The FAA fined Boeing $3.1 million over safety violations inspectors found after the door plug incident. In October, the agency allowed Boeing to increase production of the 737 Max to 42 planes a month because inspectors were satisfied with the measures the company had taken to improve safety.",
      "Alaska Airlines also declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said the airline remains \"grateful to our crew members for the bravery and quick-thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"",

    "summary": "Gov. Polis said he will make a clemency decision based on the facts of Tina Peters' election interference case, \"and there's some that work in her favor, some that work against her.\"",
    "story": [
      "During his last year in office, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis will make his final decisions on which prisoners in the state he will grant clemency. Among those under consideration is\u00a0Tina Peters, who was convicted of multiple felonies stemming from unauthorized accessing of voting machines, and who President Trump has repeatedly demanded be set free.",
      "Peters, a former county clerk of Mesa County in western Colorado and former candidate for Colorado secretary of state, was sentenced in October 2024 to nine years in prison after being convicted on seven of 10 state charges, including three counts of attempting to influence a public servant and one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation.",
      "Polis previously refused to move Peters to federal custody, but has also said recently that he would be looking into her case in his final year. Mr. Trump said in December he was granting a pardon to Peters, even though the president's pardon power is widely understood to only apply to federal crimes, and she was charged in state court.",
      "\"You can't give the president the headspace on this,\" Polis told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. \"You look at every case on clemency on the merits. You have somebody who is nonviolent, a first-time offender, elderly. On the other hand, does she take full accountability for her crime? We don't look at this in isolation.\"",
      "Peters insisted, even during her sentencing, that she did nothing wrong and was trying to prevent and discover voter fraud. There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, contrary to Mr. Trump's repeated claims.",
      "\"I have dozens of these requests that we look at regularly, and I want to make sure that we don't look at this one in any different way,\" Polis said, but noted he has not made a decision.",
      "Polis said he will only make his decision based on the facts of the case, \"and there's some that work in her favor, some that work against her.\"",
      "Polis said he has a harder time with cases where people have committed violent crimes.",
      "\"To let somebody out at some point \u2014 have they made restitution? \u2014 is a tough decision, but it's one that I'm never afraid to shy away from,\" he said.",

    "summary": "\"We have rights. Fundamental rights,\" Polis said. \"When you're minding your business and doing your own thing, really, the government shouldn't interfere.\"",
    "story": [
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat finishing out his final term who has at times found himself at odds with his party on key national issues, says the best way to understand his politics is that he is \"pro-freedom.\"",
      "That extends to more benign issues like allowing kids to operate lemonade stands without a permit, to larger concerns like legalizing so-called \"magic mushrooms,\"\u00a0which Polis supported, and vaccine mandates, which Polis opposes.",
      "\"I'm pro-vax, me and my family are vaxxed,\" Polis told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. \"I don't think the government should force you to get vaxxed. ... So, pro-freedom.\"",
      "Asked Monday about the recent changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance on childhood vaccines, recommending fewer immunizations than were previously suggested, Polis said, \"Those are recommendations, obviously.\"",
      "\"We [Colorado] use some of the national recommendations, that, you know, again, it's up to each parent to make that decision for their kids,\" Polis said. \"It's good to put the best possible information in front of people. In most cases, getting vaccinated is the best way to protect your health and your kid's health.\"",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has called the CDC's changes dangerous and said it would continue giving its own guidance.",
      "Asked how Democrats can win back voters who chose to support President Trump because of his campaign promises to give Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a major role in his administration, Polis told CBS News, \"I think Democrats should be the party of health.\"",
      "He said a main component of that is making health care more affordable, but he lamented that Democrats have not been as vocal about issues like \"the dangers of highly processed foods,\" healthy school meals, and insecticides, as some Republicans have been.",
      "\"Remember, it's nobody's goal to have to have health care. It's your goal to just stay healthy, and a lot of that comes down to diet, nutrition and exercise,\" Polis said. \"And it shouldn't he a partisan message. Colorado has the lowest obesity rate of any state. We're proud of that. We have a great outdoor lifestyle. That's something that we should really take across the country.\"",
      "Asked how far his \"pro-freedom\" stance goes, Polis said, \"I'm not an anarchist.\"",
      "\"We have rights. Fundamental rights. ... When you're minding your business and doing your own thing, really, the government shouldn't interfere,\" he said. \"When you start interfering with your neighbors and those around you, there's a very appropriate role of government to step in and say, 'They deserve their freedom too.'\"",
      "Polis' interview comes amid the Trump administration's attempts to deny Colorado and some other Democratic-led states billions of dollars in social service funding over allegations of fraud \u2014 allegations that have, in part, led to the surge of federal agents in Minneapolis, where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good last week.",
      "\"We welcome any way to look at fraud and defeat it. I mean, we see the federal government as a partner in that,\" Polis said. \"Freezing it [the funding] before they found any fraud, that's really inappropriate.\"",
      "\"We have one of the lower fraud rates of any state,\" Polis said. \"Every state's going to have some misuse of funds. We have one of the lower ones.\"",
      "Polis said that, during his time in office, national politics have become \"more vitriolic.\"",
      "\"To step down to the level of personal attacks and undermine the motives of others is really what's dangerous in today's society,\" he said. \"What bothers me the most is the huge gap in perceptions of what Democrats think Republicans believe and what Republicans think Democrats believe. Most Americans are good, honest, hardworking Americans who want to make their country a better place. And we need to celebrate that commonality.\"",
      "Polis said he believes the two parties often work better at the state level than at the national level, and noted that about half of all Coloradoans don't even belong to a political party. He touted the success of direct democracy, such as ballot initiatives that led to the legalization of marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms in the state, as well as measures such as ranked choice voting, which Denver and Boulder both use for their mayoral elections.",
      "\"I think a multi-party system would be healthier in many ways,\" he said of America's de facto two-party political system.",

      "Last month, Smith testified in a closed-door deposition for roughly nine hours on Capitol Hill before the committee, which is probing Smith's actions during his time as special counsel in the Biden administration.",
      "The committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of President Trump that Smith oversaw. Republicans on the committee have ramped up their criticism of investigative steps Smith and his office took, including their move to obtain phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers.",
      "Smith's two investigations into Mr. Trump resulted in more than 40 federal charges. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "The committee released a transcript and video of Smith's closed-door testimony last month. The former special counsel defended his prosecutions of Mr. Trump and said he was confident that he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith also rejected suggestions that he brought the cases against Mr. Trump to harm his 2024 presidential campaign, and said the Biden White House was not involved in his investigations.",
      "\"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,\" he said, referring to the 2020 election case. \"These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit.\"",
      "Smith also revealed that his team determined they had evidence to charge some of Mr. Trump's co-conspirators in the election interference case, but said he had not yet made a final decision to do so.",
      "Lanny Breuer, one of Smith's attorneys, said in a statement that his client \"has been clear for months he is ready and willing to answer questions in a public hearing about his investigations into President Trump's alleged unlawful efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents.\"",
      "Jordan initially\u00a0told Politico\u00a0on Friday that he would invite Smith to testify in the coming weeks. A source familiar with the planning confirmed that timeline to CBS News.",

    "summary": "The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Jerome Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025, according to the Fed chair.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department Friday stemming from a criminal investigation into its chair, Jerome Powell, he said in a video statement Sunday.",
      "The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025, according to Powell.",
      "\"That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" Powell said.",
      "The project and Powell's testimony came under scrutiny by the Trump administration last year, with Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought accusing Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "In his testimony to the Senate, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens, disputing claims made by Vought.",
      "\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one \u2014 certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve \u2014 is above the law,\" Powell said Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,\" Powell said.",
      "U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro said on X Monday that her office \"contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman's congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process\u2014which is not a threat.\"",
      "\"The word 'indictment' has come out of Mr. Powell's mouth, no one else's,\" Pirro said. \"None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach.\"",
      "Video message from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell: https://t.co/5dfrkByGyX pic.twitter.com/O4ecNaYaGH",
      "In a statement, a Department of Justice spokesperson said Attorney General Pam Bondi \"has instructed her U.S. Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars,\" but did not refer to any specific case.",
      "President Trump told NBC News Sunday night he didn't know about the Powell probe. \"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he remarked.",
      "Bloomberg reported\u00a0on Monday that Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte was the instigator behind the Powell subpeona. Pulte said Monday that the Justice Department is \"out of my purview,\" and he didn't \"know anything about it.\" The\u00a0Government Accountability Office is investigating Pulte for his actions\u00a0at the helm of FHFA, which the GAO said in December includes \"referrals of New York Attorney General Letitia James, U.S. Senator Adam Schiff, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, and Congressman Eric Swalwell to the U.S. Department of Justice for mortgage fraud.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council chief Kevin Hassett, rumored to be one of Mr. Trump's top choices to replace Powell when his term is up at the Fed this year, said Monday morning that he \"respects the independence of the Justice Department and the Fed.\"",
      "Asked if he was worried about volatility in the markets due to the Fed tumult, Hassett said: \"I would expect that the markets would be happy to see that there's more transparency at the Fed.\"",
      "Bipartisan criticism",
      "Senators from both sides of the aisle blasted the investigation.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, said in a statement that, \"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question. I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed\u2014including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy\u2014until this legal matter is fully resolved.\"",
      "Tillis sits on the Senate Banking Committee, which will hold confirmation hearings and vote on the president's pick to replace Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve. The committee has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so his opposition could prevent the committee from advancing the nomination for a full Senate vote.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the probe \"an assault on the Fed's independence.\"",
      "\"This is the kind of bullying that we've all come to expect from Donald Trump and his cronies. Anyone who is independent and doesn't just fall in line behind Trump gets investigated,\" Schumer said on social media.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, agrees that the committee and the Senate shouldn't advance any Trump nominee for the Fed, including the Fed chair.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns on \"The Takeout,\" Warren noted that Powell had called the Justice Department's investigation a pretext intended to enable Mr. Trump to be able to seize control of the Fed.",
      "\"Congress does not have to roll over and play dead,\" Warren said. \"If the Republicans will join the Democrats, we can basically block the president from putting anyone new in and thwart him in his efforts to take over the Fed. But it will take having enough Republicans who have enough of a spine to stand up and make that happen.\"",
      "And Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat form Virginia who also sits on the Banking Committee, issued a statement saying, \"The Fed was designed to operate independently, insulated from political pressure, so that it can make tough decisions based on data and the long-term health of the economy, not the whims of any one president. ... Uncertainty and instability can ripple through the economy, affecting borrowing costs and making it harder for families to buy a home, run a small business, or afford everyday necessities like food, fuel, and diapers.\"",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump\u00a0during his first term, replacing Janet Yellen, an appointment of President Barack Obama, and the Senate\u00a0confirmed Powll\u00a0in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "For months last year, Mr. Trump expressed his unhappiness with the Fed's decision to leave interest rates stable. The president\u00a0argued\u00a0that inflation was already low enough to start cutting rates. It wasn't until late 2025 that the Fed started cutting rates.",
      "The president has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell, including as recently as last month.",
      "Closing out his statement Sunday, Powell said, \"I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. ... I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.\"",

      "President Trump has been briefed on a wide array of military and covert tools that can be used against Iran that go well beyond conventional airstrikes, according to two Defense Department officials who spoke to CBS News under condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.",
      "The president's national security team will hold a meeting at the White House on Tuesday to discuss updated Iran options, according to several other sources familiar with the matter. It is unclear whether the president himself will be in attendance.",
      "As anti-regime protests sweep Iran, Mr. Trump has warned for weeks that he may intervene if Iranian security forces kill protesters. He told reporters Sunday that Iranian leadership indicated that it wants to negotiate, but the U.S. military is \"looking at some very strong options.\"",
      "Air power and long-range missiles remain central to any potential military response in Iran. But Pentagon planners have also presented cyber operation options and psychological campaigns intended to disrupt Iranian command structures, communications and state-run media, according to the officials.",
      "The officials said cyber and psychological operations can occur simultaneously with traditional military force, in what military planners call integrated operations. They could also be deployed as stand-alone options.",
      "The defense officials did not detail what digital infrastructure is under consideration for targeting in Iran or what, exactly, the psychological campaign against Iran's state-run media would look like if Mr. Trump were to authorize it.",
      "The two American officials emphasized that no final decision had been made and that diplomatic channels remain open. Still, the expanded menu of options suggests that Washington is preparing for scenarios in which conflict could extend beyond battlefield strikes to include sustained digital and influence campaigns.",
      "CBS News has previously reported that Mr. Trump was briefed on options for military strikes in Iran.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday that the president is \"unafraid to use military options if and when he deems necessary.\" She said airstrikes are \"one of many, many options that are on the table for the commander in chief.\"",
      "Leavitt added that \"diplomacy is always the first option,\" and said that \"what you're hearing publicly from the Iranian regime is quite [different] from the messages the administration is receiving privately.\"",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reached out to Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to engage in direct diplomatic talks, according to two sources with knowledge of the talks. A possible meeting is under discussion.",
      "Protesters have taken to the streets in all 31 provinces in Iran for two weeks, and at least 544 have been killed, according to the Human Rights Activists News. The agency found that protesters who were killed died by live ammunition or pellet gunfire, predominantly at close range.",
      "Late last week, Iranian authorities cut phone service and internet access in the capital during the protests, according to the internet monitoring organization NetBlocks. On Sunday, Iran's state-controlled media took the unusual step of airing video showing mass casualties in and outside a morgue in a Tehran suburb, a move that may have been an attempt to show sympathy with the protesters and suggest that radical actors, inspired by Mr. Trump's messages of support, are behind the violence, not the Iranian government.",
      "Mr. Trump warned Friday that if Iran begins \"killing people like they have in the past, we would get involved,\" saying: \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts.\"",
      "Asked Sunday if he would consider military and commercial installations as legitimate targets, Mr. Trump said \"we consider things targets \u2026 that they wouldn't believe.\"",

    "summary": "Three former Fed chairs and other top economic officials decry \"prosecutorial attacks\" on Jerome Powell, saying it undermines the central bank.",
    "story": [
      "Three former chairs of the Federal Reserve and other top former economic officials are rebuking the Department of Justice for launching an\u00a0investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, saying the probe will undermine the central bank's independence and hurt the U.S. economy.",
      "The statement, posted on Substack on Monday, was signed by former Fed Chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, as well as by former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner, Jacob Lew, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin.",
      "\"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,\" the signers of the statement said. \"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly.",
      "President Trump has pushed the Fed to more aggressively cut interest rates, arguing that the U.S. economy would benefit from lower borrowing costs.",
      "A fight over independence",
      "Powell has long defended the central bank's independence\u00a0on the grounds that shielding the Fed from political influence allows monetary policy makers to make objective decisions based on economic data, rather than the interests of elected officials.",
      "Justice Department subpoenas to the Fed threaten a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in\u00a0June 2025, Powell said in a video statement on Sunday.",
      "\"That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" Powell said.",
      "Other former senior economic officials to sign the statement: Jared Bernstein, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under former President Joe Biden; Jason Furman, CEA chair under former President Barack Obama; Glenn Hubbard and Gregory Mankiw, who both led the CEA under former President George W. Bush; Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund; ad Christina Romer, CEA chair under Obama.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve's independence and the public's perception of that independence are critical for economic performance, including achieving the goals Congress has set for the Federal Reserve of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates,\" the signers wrote.",
      "The statement signals that \"folks are unifying against this,\" Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Whether it changes the administration's mind is a tough question because it's a new source of pressure. But at the same time, it might amplify their resolve in seeing that the establishment is against this, so we must be right.\"",
      "Why Powell says he's being targeted",
      "The $2.5 billion project to renovate several Fed buildings, along with Powell's testimony about that effort, came under scrutiny by the Trump administration last year, with Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought accusing Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" project that may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "Powell had called some descriptions of the renovation \"misleading and inaccurate,\" disputing claims by the Trump administration that the overhaul included water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "In his video remarks on Sunday, Powell tied the investigation to Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed to cut interest rates and undermine the central bank's independence.",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role. The Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark rate three times since Mr. Trump's inauguration in January 2025, with Mr. Powell citing easing inflation and a slower labor market as causes for the reductions.",
      "Lawmakers across the aisle spoke out in defense of Powell. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican and member of the Senate Banking panel, said on Sunday that he would oppose any of the Trump administration's nominees for the Fed, including to replace Powell.",
      "\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, called the investigation \"nothing more than an attempt at coercion.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a speech at the National Press Club on Monday that \"Trump is trying to push out the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and complete his corrupt takeover of America's central bank so that it serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends.\"",
      "Powell's future at the Fed",
      "Powell is set to step down as Fed chair in May, but he could continue to serve as a Federal Reserve governor beyond that time. If he remains, the Trump administration would be deprived of the chance to fill another seat on the board.",
      "Powell has declined at several press conferences to answer questions about his plans. Asked on Monday by reporters if Powell planned to remain a Fed governor, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council and a leading candidate to become Fed chair, said he was unaware of Powell's plans.",
      "\"I've not talked to Jay about that,\" Hassett said.",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Trump has also called on another Fed official, Lisa Cook, to step down. Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed\u00a0as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, claimed Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",

    "summary": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a progressive Democrat from Massachusetts, said she told President Trump Congress could cap credit card rates if he pushes for it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren and President Trump don't agree on much, but Warren suggests they might be able to work together on capping credit card interest rates and potentially addressing other cost-of-living issues.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed a desire to cap credit card rates, something that Warren, a progressive Democrat from Massachusetts, has long supported. Late Friday, Mr. Trump proposed capping rates at 10% for one year. After Warren delivered a speech Monday morning criticizing Mr. Trump's record on affordability issues and saying he should pick up the phone to do something about capping credit card interest, Warren said the president called her.",
      "\"After my speech, the president called me, and I delivered this same message on affordability to him directly,\" Warren said in a statement. \"I told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it.\"",
      "Speaking to CBS News Monday afternoon, Warren noted that she has long supported such a plan.",
      "\"I had said at the time when he announced this a year ago, I said, great \u2014 I had been proposing that for years. Let's do it! And what's Donald Trump done since then? Nothing,\" she said.",
      "Warren said she and the president also discussed housing costs.",
      "\"While I had a chance to talk to him, I raised the question of how we reduce housing costs. We've got a bill that has passed the Senate unanimously to expand the supply of housing, but Republicans over in the House have hung it up. And Donald Trump has not lifted a finger to get that bill passed on through,\" she said.",
      "The president hasn't shared his side of the phone call.",
      "Capping credit card interest rates would be a tall order for a Republican-controlled Congress, though a handful of congressional Republicans have backed the idea, including Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna.",
      "Banks and other credit card issuers are strongly opposed to the idea, arguing a limit on interest rates could force banks to cut off access for millions of people, especially higher-risk borrowers. A coalition of industry groups, including the American Bankers Association, said Friday that a 10% cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners.\"",
      "Bank stocks dipped after Mr. Trump proposed the rate cap over the weekend.",
      "Warren and Mr. Trump have long been vocal in their criticism of each other. On the campaign trail in 2016 and since, he sometimes referred to her as \"Pocahontas\" after Warren claimed to have some Cherokee Nation heritage.",

    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell on Monday, Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi said, \"We need action to be taken.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Reza Pahlavi, Iran's exiled crown prince, called on President Trump to take action against the Iranian regime sooner rather than later, as protesters in his homeland take to the streets despite a deadly crackdown.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell on Monday, Pahlavi said, \"We need action to be taken.\"",
      "\"The best way to ensure that there will be less people killed in Iran is to intervene sooner, so this regime finally collapses and puts an end to all the problems that we are facing,\" he said.",
      "Pahlavi has lived in exile since his father, the last shah of Iran, was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power.",
      "He said he has communicated with the Trump administration, but did not disclose details from their conversations.",
      "He also said the Islamic Republic's recent outreach to the administration is a ploy to try to extinguish the nationwide protests that threaten the rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday night that he spoke with Iranian leaders on Saturday, saying that they \"called to negotiate\" as he threatens military action against the regime. Mr. Trump said he was still considering his options after appearing to draw a red line on Friday when he warned that the U.S. would get involved if the regime started \"killing people like they have in the past.\"",
      "\"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that all options remain on the table, including airstrikes.",
      "Pahlavi said Mr. Trump's red lines have already been crossed by the regime, which is now \"trying to trick\" the world into thinking it's ready to negotiate a way out of the unrest.",
      "\"The game-changer would be for this regime to know that they cannot rely anymore on a continued campaign of repression without the world reacting to it,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether he was pushing Mr. Trump to initiate regime change, Pahlavi said that the president stands in solidarity with the Iranian people, which means \"ultimately supporting them in their ask.\"",
      "\"And their ask is that this regime has to go,\" he said.",
      "Pahlavi on whether he bears some responsibility for protesters' deaths",
      "According to U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, more than 500 people have been killed and the number of arrests exceeds 10,000 as the protests stretch into their third week.",
      "When asked whether it's responsible to send Iranians to their deaths by encouraging them to take to the streets as the regime wages a violent crackdown, Pahlavi didn't answer directly, but said: \"This is a war and war has casualties.\"",
      "\"In order to preserve and protect and minimize the death toll, minimize innocent victims yet again be killed by this regime, action is needed,\" he said.",
      "Pahlavi, who has tried to position himself as a transitional leader of Iran, characterized himself as Iranians' voice in the outside world. He has claimed that chants of his name during the protests demonstrate the legitimacy of the role he could play, though it's unclear how much support he actually has inside the country.",
      "\"Why is it that I offer my service to Iran? I'm answering their call,\" he said. \"I'm a bridge and not the destination at this point.\"",
      "Pahlavi hasn't set foot in Iran in nearly 50 years. But asked if he was willing to die for the cause, he said yes, and pointed to the fearlessness of those on the front lines of the protests.",
      "\"How could I not possibly be prepared to die for them? To die for liberty, to die for saving our nation? I'm prepared to do that,\" he said.",
      "On what makes current protests different",
      "Pahlavi also spoke about how the current protests, which were sparked last month by the collapse of the country's currency, are different from past uprisings.",
      "\"Today, the ask is not just for reform, or for that matter, an economic demand. It is now putting an end to this regime. This is really the revolution in its true sense of the world,\" he said.",
      "Another factor is Mr. Trump being in the White House, he said. (Mr. Trump was also president during protests in Iran in 2018 and 2019, which did not result in regime change.)",
      "\"Unlike some predecessors to the current president of the United States, he's a man that means what he says and says what he means,\" Pahlavi said.",

      "Robert McBride, a former longtime federal prosecutor in Kentucky's Eastern District, had only been on the job as first assistant U.S. Attorney for a few months after joining the office in the fall.

      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia declined to comment on the firing, which was reported earlier by MS Now.",
      "Comey, one of President Trump's perceived political foes, was indicted last fall on two counts alleging he provided false testimony to Congress in September 2020.",
      "The indictment was secured solely by Lindsey Halligan, who was hand-picked by Mr. Trump to serve as interim U.S. Attorney after her predecessor declined to pursue criminal charges against Comey or New York Attorney General Letitia James, citing a lack of evidence.",
      "Halligan secured indictments against both Comey and James without any involvement from career prosecutors, who declined to get involved because of the weak evidence in both cases, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "In November, a federal judge dismissed the charges against both Comey and James, finding that Halligan had been unlawfully appointed. The Justice Department is currently appealing that ruling.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:48:23 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court will consider whether laws in Idaho and West Virginia banning transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's sports teams violate the Constitution and Title IX.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday is set to consider whether states can forbid transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's sports teams, stepping into a high-stakes fight that has been simmering for years.",
      "Twenty-seven states have enacted laws that prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports. President Trump signed an executive order in February that directed his administration to strip federal funding from programs that allow transgender girls and women to compete on athletic teams that correspond with their gender identity.",
      "On the heels of that directive, the NCAA updated its participation policy for transgender student-athletes, limiting competition in women's sports to only athletes assigned female at birth. Then, last July, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee effectively barred transgender women from competing on women's teams.",
      "The Supreme Court is now poised to wade into the debate over transgender athletes' participation in girls' and women's sports when it convenes Tuesday to hear arguments in two cases involving restrictions from Idaho and West Virginia. The justices are confronted with whether the measures violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and Title IX, the landmark 50-year-old law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities.",
      "Two transgender athletes who challenged their states' laws, Lindsay Hecox and Becky Pepper-Jackson, argue the bans discriminate against them on the basis of sex and transgender status. The laws, they say, categorically exclude all transgender girls and women from school sports altogether, since they're barred from joining the teams that match their gender identity and cannot compete on boys' or men's teams because it would be inconsistent with their gender identity.",
      "\"I play for my school for the same reason other kids on my track team do \u2014 to make friends, have fun, and challenge myself through practice and teamwork,\" Pepper-Jackson said in a video statement. \"And all I've ever wanted was the same opportunities as my peers.\"",
      "But the states argue that their laws do not discriminate based on transgender status, and instead draw permissible distinctions between the sexes. West Virginia and Idaho officials say their bans' sex-based classifications are allowed because they are substantially related to their interest in fair and safe athletic opportunities for women and girls.",
      "\"Every time a male athlete runs as a female, a roster spot is lost to a female. It means it's given to a male. And that's unfair,\" Madison Kenyon, who ran collegiate track and cross-country and competed against a transgender woman, told CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford.",
      "Kenyon continued: \"Those opportunities to compete, to have a scholarship, to gain an education for women, were almost unheard of 50 years ago. Title IX was created to give women equal opportunity, equal spots in sports as men. And when men compete as women, it defeats the purpose of that. It gets rid of our equal opportunity and takes away our ability to get a scholarship and to compete and to get an education. And I experienced that.\"",
      "Idaho's first-in-the-nation law",
      "Idaho was the first state to enact a law banning transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's athletic teams. Called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, the measure requires public school and collegiate sports teams to be designated \"based on biological sex,\" and states that athletic teams designated for females, women or girls \"shall not be open to students of the male sex.\"",
      "If a student's sex is disputed, the law requires the athlete to provide a health examination and consent form that verifies their biological sex at birth.",
      "Hecox, a transgender woman who wanted to compete on the women's track and cross-country teams at Boise State University, filed a lawsuit challenging Idaho's law. She argued the measure was unconstitutional and violated Title IX. Hecox, who receives hormone therapy, tried out for the university's track and cross-country teams but did not make them. She instead participated in women's club soccer and running.",
      "Defending the law are Idaho's attorney general and two athletes, Kenyon and Mary Kate Marshall, who competed on the women's track and cross-country teams at Idaho State University. They\u00a0placed behind a transgender student-athlete in various events in 2019 and early 2020.",
      "\"Stepping on the line, standing next to a male when we're about to race \u2014 it's unfair,\" Marshall told Crawford. \"I don't know how much \u2014 they don't have to put in as much work as I do because of the clear advantages that they have.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge David C. Nye blocked enforcement of the ban in 2020, finding that it \"discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed that decision and concluded that Idaho's ban is likely unconstitutional.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in July to take up the challenge to Idaho's law, as well as West Virginia's. But since then, Hecox, now 25, has sought to have the case dismissed as moot.",
      "Citing \"significant challenges that have affected her both personally and academically,\" as well as \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters\" because of the lawsuit, Hecox's lawyers wrote in a filing that she decided to refrain from playing any women's sports at Boise State University or in Idaho, and would not participate in any school-sponsored athletics covered by Idaho's ban.",
      "The Supreme Court is set to discuss at oral arguments whether to dismiss her case.",
      "West Virginia's law",
      "West Virginia lawmakers enacted the state's ban, called the Save Women's Sports Act, in 2021. Like Idaho's measure, the law requires athletic teams to be designated \"based on biological sex,\" and states that \"athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to students of the male sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.\"",
      "Before the law took effect, Pepper-Jackson wanted to compete on the girls' cross-country and track teams, and sued to block enforcement of the ban against her, arguing it violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. Pepper-Jackson, a 15-year-old transgender girl, began socially transitioning in third grade and has taken puberty-delaying medication and hormone therapy. She is now a sophomore in high school.",
      "In 2023, a U.S. district court upheld the law on both equal protection and Title IX grounds, finding West Virginia's classification based on biological sex is substantially related to its interest in providing equal athletic opportunities for females.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and the Supreme Court blocked West Virginia officials from enforcing the ban against Pepper-Jackson while proceedings continued, with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas in dissent. The 4th Circuit then divided 2-1 in finding that the law violates Title IX because it discriminates based on gender identity, which it said is discrimination on the basis of sex.",
      "The legal battle over transgender athletes",
      "Schools have had sex-separated school sports teams for decades, but Republican-led states began enacting their recent restrictions as a growing number of instances of transgender athletes competing in girls' and women's sporting events came to light.",
      "One openly transgender U.S. athlete competed at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, middle-distance runner Nikki Hiltz, who uses they/them pronouns and was assigned female at birth. NCAA President Charlie Baker told a Senate panel in December 2024 that he was aware of fewer than 10 transgender athletes who were among the 510,000 student-athletes governed by the association.",
      "It's unclear how many transgender athletes are covered by bans in the 27 states that restrict participation in girls' and women's sports. The Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimates that up to 122,000 transgender athletes could be participating in high school athletics.",
      "Pepper-Jackson is the only openly transgender student-athlete in West Virginia, her lawyers say.",
      "But dozens of female athletes competing at the high school and collegiate level told the Supreme Court in filings about their experiences competing against transgender athletes on basketball and volleyball courts, at track meets and in swimming pools.",
      "\"There's quite an unfair advantage that males have on females. And when they compete against women, it ruins the integrity of our sports,\" Kenyon said. \"Running is a mental sport. And when you step on the line and you're racing a male athlete, the race hasn't even started, but it feels like the outcome has already been decided.\"",
      "And Pepper-Jackson's participation in girls' sports in West Virginia has had reverberations, state officials say. They estimate that she displaced at least 400 female athletes in standings in track-and-field events in the spring 2025 season, and she placed third in discus and eighth in shot put at a May state championship meet.",
      "\"In an athletic regime where women are supposed to have the ability to compete fairly against other females, when you put a male in that mix, it's not fair,\" said Jonathan Bursch, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative judicial group that is co-counsel to the states. \"That's why we have girls' sports. And you can't erase those physical differences, even with puberty blockers.\"",
      "In defending the bans, the Alliance Defending Freedom and Idaho officials argue in filings that sex is biological and immutable, and causes the differences between males and females. They say the sports-participation laws are motivated by those physical and physiological differences, and classify based on sex to account for those distinctions.",
      "\"While these cases are simply about upholding these 27 state laws, it's really about restoring common sense, fairness and safety in sports and beyond based on biological reality,\" Bursch told CBS News.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, West Virginia Solicitor General Michael Williams and state officials said the 4th Circuit's decision requires states to treat sex and gender identity as synonymous when it comes to sports.",
      "\"Sex affects athletic performance; gender identity does not,\" West Virginia lawyers wrote. \"If the court below were right, then Title IX's role in preserving girls' sports opportunities would end.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Hecox's lawyers first argue her case should be dismissed because she has stopped playing any sports covered by the ban. Lawyers for the two athletes also refute that Idaho and West Virginia's laws are substantially related to their interests in promoting equality and safety in female athletics. Hecox and Pepper-Jackson have no athletic advantage over competitors because of the medical treatments they've received, they say.",
      "\"The statutory text, history, and purpose lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Act intentionally treats transgender women and girls differently \u2014 and worse \u2014 by categorically barring them from playing women's and girls' sports,\" Hecox's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "In West Virginia's case, Pepper-Jackson's legal team says in court papers that Title IX does not authorize the \"wholesale exclusion\" of transgender girls from athletics. They argue the state's restriction subjects Pepper-Jackson to discrimination because it denies her equal access to athletics.",
      "\"The question before the court is straightforward: Does the law permit West Virginia to categorically exclude transgender students from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity? And the answer is no,\" Sasha Buchert, director of the Transgender & Nonbinary Rights Project at Lambda Legal, told reporters. \"These young people deserve the same opportunities, the same dignity and the same chance to grow through sports that we afford to all students.\"",
      "The Trump administration is backing West Virginia and Idaho in the cases. In a friend-of-the-court brief, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the practice of sex-separated sports is justified for transgender athletes because physiological differences between males and females are unrelated to gender identity and are not eliminated by medical interventions like puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "\"In short, the laws of West Virginia and Idaho place trans-identifying athletes on sports teams on the same valid, biology-based terms as everyone else,\" Sauer wrote. \"That is the definition of equal treatment. It is not gender-identity discrimination at all, much less sex discrimination.\"",
      "Transgender rights at the Supreme Court",
      "The pair of disputes over transgender athletes' participation in girls' and women's sports are the latest involving LGBTQ rights that have landed before the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2020, the justices divided 6-3 to expand protections from workplace discrimination under Title VII to transgender and gay employees, with Justice Neil Gorsuch authoring the majority opinion. Lawyers for Pepper-Jackson argue that the court's reasoning in that case should extend to Title IX, which uses similar language.",
      "\"Just as discriminating against a transgender person in employment is sex discrimination under Title VII, it's also sex discrimination under Title IX, and when Becky is prevented from being on teams with other girls like her, she is subjected to discrimination that effectively excludes her from participating in the school's educational programs,\" Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU's LGBT & HIV Project, told reporters. Block will be arguing on behalf of Pepper-Jackson before the Supreme Court.",
      "But Bursch, of the Alliance Defending Freedom, said that under Title VII, sex isn't supposed to be a factor in whether a person is hired, fired, promoted or disciplined. In the context of Title IX, though, sex has to be considered, otherwise there wouldn't be male and female sports teams, he said.",
      "\"When you're talking about a statute that requires consideration of sex, then all of a sudden, sex discrimination means something very different than it does in Title VII,\" he said. \"And if the court were to adopt the Bostock reasoning in Title IX, it would completely destroy male and female sports teams.\"",
      "Most recently, in its last term, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law barring medical interventions for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. The high court found that the law does not rely on sex-based classifications, but instead draws lines based on medical use and age.",
      "The Supreme Court has also allowed Mr. Trump to temporarily enforce policies banning transgender people from serving in the military and requiring passports to reflect the holder's biological sex at birth. Both cases landed before the high court in their early stages, and the Supreme Court has not yet been asked to decide the legal merits.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Department of Health and Human Services from halting around $10 billion in social services funding to multiple Democratic states, a move the agency argued was necessary to crack down on fraud \u2014 but the states called unconstitutional.",
      "The states covered by the decision are California, New York, Minnesota, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "HHS announced plans to freeze the funding earlier this week. The move would cut off some $7 billion from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, $2.4 billion from the Child Care Development Fund and $870 million in social services grants.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Submaranian on Friday granted a request by the states for a temporary restraining order halting the funding freeze. The order will last for 14 days, while the court considers a request for a longer-term order.",
      "HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill said on X: \"We will comply with the court, but we will fight. We will appeal. We will keep asking questions.\"",
      "The funding freeze came as the Trump administration alleged pervasive fraud in social programs run by Democratic states \u2014 an issue that was vaulted into national prominence by revelations that hundreds of millions of dollars were bilked from child nutrition, housing and autism programs in Minnesota.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told CBS News earlier this week the impacted states \"are not affected because they're Democratic,\" but because they allegedly \"refuse to cooperate with developing plans that would end the fraud.\"",
      "Kennedy said the impacted states were given warnings before their funding was frozen, but \"if you won't show us a plan, a workable plan, we're gonna cut it off until you do.\"",
      "\"The best way to help poor families is to end the fraud so that the money that is available for them. And that's what we're doing,\" Kennedy said.",
      "In a lawsuit against HHS filed in Manhattan federal court, the five states argued the Trump administration's focus on fraud was merely a \"pretext\" to punish Democratic states that are \"disfavored by the Administration.\" They also called the funding freezes an \"extraordinary and cruel\" move that would hamper programs used by needy children and families.",
      "The states alleged that the funding freeze is illegal and unconstitutional. They argued that the federal government can't cut off funding based on \"mere allegations or suspicion of fraud\" without following a legal process that gives states an opportunity to respond to HHS's concerns and appeal the agency's decisions.",
      "Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement Friday he was \"pleased with the court's decision.\"",

    "summary": "Mexico has become a key fuel supplier to Cuba since Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture by the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Despite President Trump's social media pronouncement Sunday that \"there will be no more oil or money going to Cuba \u2014 zero,\" the current U.S. policy is to allow Mexico to continue to provide oil to the island, according to Energy Secretary Chris Wright and another U.S. official.",
      "Cuba desperately needs the oil, since Venezuela is no longer supplying it, after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's ouster just over a week ago.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Monday morning. The White House and Mexican government have not yet said whether Mexico's oil supply to Cuba was discussed.",
      "Mexico, which was providing some oil to Cuba before Maduro's capture by the U.S., has become an especially key fuel supplier to the island since the Venezuelan leader's arrest, which was accompanied by the U.S. interception of vessels carrying oil to Cuba. Sheinbaum has referred to oil as \"humanitarian aid.\"",
      "The U.S. does not seek to trigger a collapse of the Cuban government, but rather seeks to negotiate with Havana to transition away from its authoritarian communist system, according to a U.S. official. Mr. Trump's post Sunday morning threatened Cuba, advising the island to make a deal \"before it is too late.\" It was not immediately clear what kind of deal Mr. Trump is seeking from Cuba or who would lead them. A little later, he reshared a post predicting Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be the next president of Cuba. \"Sounds good to me,\" Mr. Trump commented.",
      "The Cuban regime had a series of defiant responses to Mr. Trump's social media threats.",
      "\"As history demonstrates, relations between the U.S. and Cuba, in order to advance, must be based on International Law rather than on hostility, threats, and economic coercion,\" Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez said on X Monday.",
      "He also denied any current talks were underway.",
      "\"There are no conversations with the U.S. government, except for technical contacts in the migration field,\" D\u00edaz-Canel said in another X post.",
      "The U.S. assesses that a total cutoff or embargo of Cuba would be a shock to Havana's already overtaxed and decrepit electrical grid, which has been suffering from rolling blackouts. Cuba's economic condition is dire \u2014 a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that the regime has been so cash strapped that its leaders were reselling some Venezuelan oil to China, the New York Times first reported. This was exacerbating the ongoing energy shortage on the island even before Maduro's arrest.",
      "That economic strain on Havana intensified, now that it has lost virtually all its patrons, and Russia has been tied up in Ukraine.",
      "The regime was intricately tied to Venezuela: It recently acknowledged the deaths of at least 32 Cubans who were protecting Maduro and were killed in the U.S. raid to capture him. Until now, Cuban officials have denied that its intel and security forces provided personal protection to Maduro, even protecting him from his own people as part of the oil-for-security arrangement between the two governments.",
      "The regime in Havana is under intense strain but has had tremendous staying power to date. That appears to be behind the CIA's mixed assessment of its stability.",
      "In October, the U.S. offered humanitarian aid to Cuba, which would be delivered by local partners, rather than through the government. Cuban and U.S. officials told CBS News it still has not yet arrived.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly filed a lawsuit against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seeking to block the Pentagon's efforts to downgrade his retirement rank and pay.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona filed a civil lawsuit against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday seeking to block the Pentagon's efforts to downgrade his retirement rank and pay, which he claims amounts to unconstitutional retaliation against him.",
      "In a 46-page complaint, Kelly, a retired Navy captain, argued that he is the target of \"extreme rhetoric and punitive retribution\" by the Trump administration over a video in which he and other lawmakers urged members of the military to \"refuse illegal orders.\" Kelly asked a federal judge to set aside Hegseth's recent moves\u00a0and block the enforcement of any punishment against him.",
      "The Arizona Democratic senator alleged that he was punished for protected speech and said administration officials retaliated against him in violation of the First Amendment. Kelly also argued that his criticisms of Hegseth are at the core of the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, which provides immunity to lawmakers from criminal prosecutions or civil lawsuits that stem from legislative acts.",
      "\"It appears that never in our nation's history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,\" Kelly's legal team wrote in the complaint. \"Allowing that unprecedented step here would invert the constitutional structure by subordinating the Legislative Branch to executive discipline and chilling congressional oversight of the armed forces.\"",
      "They said Kelly's public statements and legislative acts in response to the Trump administration's actions regarding the military are \"significant matters of public concern\" that fit within the First Amendment's protections and his oversight responsibilities as a senator. The senator's lawyers added that they believe there is no legal basis to take action against him based on \"post-retirement political speech.\"",
      "Kelly said in a statement that Hegseth's efforts to punish him leave military veterans at risk of seeing their rank and pay downgraded years after they retire for making comments that he or other defense secretaries dislike.",
      "\"His unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: if you speak out and say something that the President or Secretary of Defense doesn't like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted,\" Kelly said.",
      "Kelly and his colleagues came under fierce criticism by the Trump administration after they posted the video in November. The video was published amid the military buildup around Venezuela and strikes against alleged drug boats, and featured five other Democratic lawmakers who served in the U.S. military or in the intelligence community. They have not faced any adverse action from the Defense Department as they do not draw retirement pay from the U.S. military.",
      "President Trump and Hegseth lambasted the lawmakers for the comments, claiming that their statements amounted to \"sedition\" and \"treason.\"",
      "Hegseth claimed Kelly's statements \"undermined the chain of command\" and constituted \"conduct unbecoming an officer.\" The Pentagon\u00a0announced it was conducting a review of misconduct allegations against Kelly to determine whether he should be recalled to active duty to face court-martial proceedings.",
      "The Defense Department said in December it was \"escalating\" its review into a command investigation.",
      "Hegseth announced\u00a0last week that the Pentagon had \"initiated retirement grade determination proceedings\" that could result in a \"reduction in his retired grade\" and \"a corresponding reduction in retired pay.\" Hegseth also said he issued a formal letter to censure Kelly, citing his \"reckless misconduct.\"",
      "\"This Censure is a necessary process step, and will be placed in Captain Kelly's official and permanent military personnel file,\" Hegseth added.",
      "Under federal law, retired U.S. military members can receive non-judicial punishments or even be charged, court-martialed and punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the system of rules and regulations established by Congress governing the military.",

    "story": [
      "Former Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola is launching a Senate bid to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan in Alaska.",
      "Peltola, who represented Alaska as its at-large member in the House until last year, announced her Senate campaign in a video released Monday morning.",
      "\"Systemic change is the only way to bring down grocery costs, save our fisheries, lower energy prices and build new housing Alaskans can afford,\" she said. \"No one from the Lower 48 is coming to save us, but I know this in my bones, there is no group of people more ready to save ourselves than Alaskans.\"",
      "Peltola, who is Yup'ik, became the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress when she won special and regular elections in 2022. In 2024, she lost her seat to Republican Nick Begich. Alaska has only one representative in the House, meaning it has more U.S. senators than House members.",
      "Peltola, 52, is a mother of seven and a grandmother. Her husband, Eugene Peltola Jr., died in 2023 after a plane crash in Alaska.",
      "Sullivan, 61, has been a U.S. senator for Alaska since 2015. In 2020, he defeated his Democratic opponent, Al Gross, by more than 12 points. Moderate GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski is the other U.S. senator representing Alaska.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-maha-health-states/",
    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:10 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Make America Healthy Again\" policies driven by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have made major strides in state legislatures, with food additives among the most common targets.",
    "story": [
      "When one of Adam Burkhammer's foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.",
      "\"We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,\" said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. \"There are real impacts on real kids.\"",
      "The Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.",
      "The bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Chemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans \u2014 and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program \u2014 created last year as part of the GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas \u2014 offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.",
      "Federal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water, and PFAS, a group of compounds known as \"forever chemicals\" that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.",
      "In addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.",
      "Most synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden's term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.",
      "Major food companies including Nestle, Hershey, and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.",
      "\"We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,\" said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.",
      "This past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.",
      "\"The state laws are really what's motivating companies to get rid of dyes,\" said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.",
      "Andy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California's 2023 law, which bans four food additives.",
      "\"It's not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,\" Baker-White said.",
      "Although Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 SNAP, or food stamps \u2014 from using their benefits to buy candy or sugary drinks. In December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved similar waivers sought by six states. Eighteen states will block SNAP purchases of those items in 2026.",
      "There are bound to be more. The Rural Health Transformation Program also offers incentives to states that implemented restrictions on SNAP.",
      "\"There are real and concrete effects where the rural health money gives points for changes in SNAP eligibility or the SNAP definitions,\" Baker-White said.",
      "In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that sets a legal definition for ultraprocessed foods and will phase them out of schools. It's a move that may be copied in other states in 2026, while also providing fodder for legal battles. In December, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu sued major food companies, accusing them of selling \"harmful and addictive\" products. The lawsuit names specific brands \u2014 including cereals, pizzas, sodas, and potato chips \u2014 linking them to serious health problems.",
      "Kennedy has also blamed ultraprocessed foods for chronic diseases. But even proponents of the efforts to tackle nutrition concerns don't agree on which foods to target. MAHA adherents on the right haven't focused on sugar and sodium as much as policymakers on the left. The parties have also butted heads over some Republicans' championing of raw milk, which can spread harmful germs, and the consumption of saturated fat, which contributes to heart disease.",
      "Policymakers expect other flash points. Moves by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are making vaccine access more difficult have led blue states to find ways to set their own standards apart from federal recommendations, with 15 Democratic governors announcing a new public health alliance in October. Meanwhile, more red states may eliminate vaccine mandates for employees; Idaho made them illegal. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing to eliminate school vaccine mandates.",
      "Even as Kennedy advocates eliminating artificial dyes, the Environmental Protection Agency has loosened restrictions on chemicals and pesticides, leading MAHA activists to circulate an online petition calling on President Donald Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.",
      "Congress has yet to act on most MAHA proposals. But state lawmakers are poised to tackle many of them.",
      "\"If we're honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,\" said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker. \"We're going to step up as states and do the right thing.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department has a playbook ready for responding to emergencies like the one unfolding in Minneapolis, including containing unrest and defusing community anger or distrust in law enforcement.",
      "In the civil rights era, the agency formed its Community Relations Service, a group of dozens of federal specialists who were informally referred to as \"America's peacemaker.\"",
      "For the type of crisis emerging in Minneapolis, the Community Relations Service had a long-time, fulltime staffer based in Minnesota, and would also immediately deploy its specialists from Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Indianapolis and Madison to get on the ground promptly to assist.",
      "At a time when relations between federal agents and the Minneapolis community, Portland and other U.S. cities have been deteriorating, the Justice Department is being criticized for scrapping its playbook, and turning away its \"peacemakers.\"",
      "Several sources, including current and former Justice Department employees, said the Trump administration has shuttered the office and has begun pushing out many of the approximately 60 employees who served in the Community Relations Service.",
      "In a June 2025 report, the Trump administration said, \"The (community relations service) mission does not comport with Attorney General and Administration law enforcement and litigating priorities.\"",
      "An agency budget request for 2026 showed the Justice Department planned to reduce the office's staffing from 56 to zero. The Justice Department estimates the cuts would save $24 million this year.",
      "Julius Nam, a former Justice Department prosecutor and Community Relations Service specialist told CBS News the office\" has had a neutral, impartial role. That is so important in these situations, in which there is deep distrust of law enforcement by protesters and community groups.\"",
      "The Community Relations Service, whose specialists are referred to as \"conciliators,\" convenes forums, meetings and dialogues to ease tensions and help head off unrest, protests and hate crimes.",
      "In a span from 2021 through 2024, the office conducted more than a dozen formal mediation sessions and more than 100 training programs.",
      "In Minneapolis, the office had some recent successes, in its response to the killing of George Floyd in 2020. An agency report reviewed by CBS News said the Community Relations Service's deployment to Minneapolis during the trial of Floyd's killer was the largest by the office in 2021.",
      "\"The Community Relations Service deployed twice to Minneapolis during the trial and sentencing of Derek Chauvin,\" the report said. \"Despite the challenges of social distancing, CRS conciliators worked for months to build relationships with the community, facilitate dialogues, and lead trainings.\"",
      "Bert Brandenburg, who used to work in the Community Relations Service, told CBS News, \"When we sideline peacemakers, we all pay the price.\"",
      "\"Minnesota is not the first and not the last city where you'd want peacemakers on the streets.\"",
      "Brandenburg said that through its 60-year history, the office was effective in its work to ensure independence and trust among police, local government leaders and communities during conflicts. He said the Community Relations Service would help de-escalate tensions and build up sufficient trust to get both sides of a conflict into a room for discussion and reconciliation.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News the portfolio and functions of the former Community Relations Service have been shifted into federal prosecutors' offices nationwide. The spokesperson said, \"This transition will save the Department over $11 million and further President Trump's mission of having a federal government that's more efficient and effective for the American people.\"",
      "CBS News has learned that approximately 30 laid off Justice Department employees have been called back to work for the agency.\u00a0 Those employees include some who worked for the Community Relations Service. According to one of the impacted employees, the workers have been reassigned to work for federal prosecutors.",
      "Nearly a dozen civil rights organizations and charities filed a civil lawsuit in Massachusetts, seeking a court order to prevent the dismantling of the Community Relations Service. In the lawsuit, in which NAACP St. Louis County and the Haitian Community Help & Support Center are among the plaintiffs, the groups argue the Trump administration's cuts to the office were unlawful and have stymied critical, ongoing work by the Community Relations Service.",
      "The suit said the Trump administration's decision disrupted ongoing de-escalation efforts, including \"mediation among community groups and law enforcement over a race-related policing incident when CRS abruptly [withdrew] from the process, leaving them without a mediator or any final agreement among the parties.\"",
      "\"The Community Relations Service was designed to help de-escalate tensions like those we see in Minneapolis and Portland, and for decades it succeeded in that mission,\" said Stacey Young, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Justice Connection, a group organized in 2025 to help represent and serve ousted Justice Department employees.",
      "Young said, \"For no logical reason, the administration discarded the experts who were best positioned to keep budding conflicts from turning violent. We're seeing the consequences of that fateful decision.\"",
      "A newly introduced federal funding bill aimed at averting a government shutdown next month would allocate $20 million in funding for the Community Relations Service, if approved.",
      "Support for the funding appears highly likely among House and Senate Democrats.",
      "Nearly 100 congressional Democrats have filed a court motion in support of the civil rights groups' legal challenge to the Community Relations Service cuts. Their motion argued the Trump administration was closing the office by \"executive fiat\" and is \"leaving local communities without the vital peacemaking support and services that the agency has long provided.\"",
      "The Community Relations Service was set up in the 1960's, amid metastasizing unrest, including fractured relationships between communities and police departments. The office was credited with helping prevent another riot in 1993, as racial tensions re-emerged following the second trial of police who beat Rodney King in California.",
      "It also helped ease rising racial tensions after the 1997 fatal police shooting of a Chinese-American man in Rohnert Park, California, and in Akron, Ohio in 2022, after the shooting of a Black man by police.",
      "Nam, the former Community Relations Service specialist, told CBS News he expects the Trump administration will shift some of the office's responsibility to its 93 U.S. attorneys' offices nationwide. He said the mission risks failing \u2013 or falling short \u2013 if it operates out of prosecutors' offices. And he added that the Community Relations Service was effective, in part, because it was not connected to law-enforcement agents, and was best positioned to build relationships with people in American communities.",
      "Nam told CBS News, \"Those people could have gone to Minneapolis immediately this week.\"",

    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security policy is dated Jan. 8 and was submitted Saturday in federal court comes amid three Democratic lawmakers being denied entry to an ICE facility in Minneapolis.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security has again required members of Congress to give prior notice before inspecting immigration detention facilities, issuing a new policy to bypass a court order that had blocked officials from restricting such oversight visits.",
      "The new policy, dated Jan. 8 and submitted Saturday in federal court, says members of Congress need to schedule any visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities 7 days in advance. Any exemptions to the rule have to be approved by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who signed the new memo.",
      "Over the weekend, Democratic Minnesota Representatives Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison said they were denied entry into an ICE facility in Minneapolis. Tensions there have escalated after an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good on Wednesday. Trump administration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense, a claim rejected by local leaders.",
      "In December, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. blocked an identical DHS policy that required members of Congress to submit requests at least 7 days in advance of\u00a0 visiting facilities holding those facing deportation in ICE custody. Before that policy, issued in June, ICE had historically allowed members of Congress to visit its detention facilities, without prior notice.",
      "The December court ruling cited language in appropriations law that prohibits DHS from using funds to prevent members of Congress from conducting oversight visits to ICE detention centers, or from requiring those lawmakers to \"provide prior notice of the intent to enter\" such facilities.",
      "But in her new memo, Noem ordered DHS to again implement the 7-day notice requirement \"exclusively with money appropriated by the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act),\" not regular appropriations.",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law over the summer, provided an\u00a0unprecedented infusion\u00a0of funding for immigration enforcement, including $75 billion to ICE alone to bolster deportation efforts and expand detention capacity.",
      "Noem said the policy is needed to protect lawmakers, their staff, ICE detainees and employees.",

      "President Trump disclosed U.S. jobs data the day before the Department of Labor released\u00a0hiring numbers for December, a closely watched economic report on Wall Street that can sway financial markets.",
      "At 8:20 p.m. EST on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u00a0posted a graph depicting changes in private and government employment since January 2025. When the full jobs report was released Friday morning, it became clear that Mr. Trump's post had incorporated the December employment data because the totals in the chart matched figures released in the monthly report.",
      "Mr. Trump brushed off the incident. \"I don't know if they posted them,\" he told reporters Friday afternoon. \"They gave me some numbers. When people give me things, I post them.\"",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump's post came after he was briefed on the employment numbers, calling it an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information.\"",
      "The White House is now reviewing its protocols for economic data releases, the official added.",
      "Cooler hiring",
      "The government's latest jobs report shows that hiring cooled in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs, while the nation's unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%. The economy added roughly 584,000 jobs for all of 2025, down from more than 2 million in 2024, labor data shows.",
      "Federal economic data is held under strict embargo until its scheduled release because the information has the potential to move financial markets. Providing some investors with access to such data could allow them to place trades based on knowledge unavailable to other investors.",
      "White House economic officials are provided with an advance copy of the Labor Department's employment report each month on Thursday afternoon and sign agreements to keep the numbers confidential, though they also write up a summary for the president, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Data leaks can undermine investor confidence, as markets expect officials to keep a tight lid on economic reports until they're released publicly, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "\"Markets don't react kindly to that, because obviously it means that perhaps a select few may have been able to front-run on that news ahead of the market at large,\" he said.",
      "Erica Groshen, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unit that compiles the monthly employment figures, said that premature disclosures of the agency's data can be punished by fines and even jail time. But previous breaches typically have been met with a slap on the wrist, she noted.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump's inadvertent data release.",
      "No market disruption",
      "Although some investors could have acted on the information Mr. Trump posted on Thursday, there were no evident signs of a change in trading or market prices related to the jobs data, said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge.",
      "Mr. Trump's data provided only a partial snapshot of the December labor market, while most investors are looking for the overall monthly data, including the most recent unemployment rate, he added.",
      "\"For people who are kind of really trying to get a sense of the economy, they want to look at the full release,\" Crisafulli said.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:53:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

      "\"It's been a pleasure serving with you, watching you see Earth for the first time, riding on the rocket, and now it's coming to an end where we get to go home,\" he said. \"It's bittersweet.\"",
      "All four Crew 11 fliers looked healthy and in good spirits on a  space-to-ground television broadcast of the change of command ceremony with no indication of which astronaut may have experienced the undisclosed medical issue that triggered Crew 11's early departure.",
      "Fincke then presented Kud-Sverchkov with a symbolic key to the space station.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:46:32 -0500",
    "summary": "A planned spacewalk outside the International Space Station was scrapped because of what NASA called a \"medical concern\" with an unidentified crew member.",
    "story": [
      "Four space station fliers have been told to cut their mission short and return to Earth ahead of schedule because of an apparently serious medical issue affecting an unidentified crew member, NASA announced Thursday.",
      "\"Yesterday, January 7, a single crew member on board the station experienced a medical situation and is now stable,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a news conference.",
      "\"After discussions with Chief Health and Medical Officer Dr. J.D. Polk and leadership across the agency, I've come to the decision that it's in the best interest of our astronauts to return Crew 11 ahead of their planned departure (in mid February). ... We expect to provide a further update within the next 48 hours as to the expected, anticipated undock and re-entry timeline.\"",
      "In keeping with the agency's strict medical privacy policy, NASA officials have not identified the astronaut in question or provided any details about the nature of the medical issue.",
      "But the ailing astronaut is a member of NASA's Crew 11, made up of commander Zena Cardman, veteran astronaut Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "They were launched to the International Space Station on Aug. 1 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship. They were planning to return to Earth around Feb. 20, after their Crew 12 replacements arrive.",
      "Fincke and Cardman were planning to venture outside the space station on Thursday to complete a support truss for an add-on solar array and to carry out a variety of other tasks.",
      "But on Wednesday, NASA announced the spacewalk had been called off due to a \"medical concern\" with one of the Crew 11 astronauts. The agency said the crew member was \"stable,\" but no other details were provided.",
      "Polk said Thursday that the astronaut in question was not injured or made ill by any operational aspect of living aboard the space station, adding that spacewalk preparations played no role in the incident.",
      "Isaacman said the planned early return of Crew 11 did not represent an \"emergency,\" adding the agency was simply erring on the side of caution to ensure the health and well-being of the astronaut. Even so, Crew 11's early return will mark the first time in U.S. space history that a mission has been cut short due to a medical issue.",
      "Polk agreed it was not an emergency, adding \"This is not an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations, but unrelated to the operational environment that we have right now. It's mostly having a medical issue in the difficult areas of microgravity and with the suite of hardware that we have at our disposal available to complete a diagnosis.\"",
      "Space station crews have extensive medical equipment on board and crew members are trained to serve as medical officers.",
      "Physician and former astronaut Tom Marshburn told CBS News that space station crews are \"equipped to deal with all the things that have happened in space over the 65 years of human spaceflight, any of those things that come up. Even to the some extreme examples, like a heart attack, something like that. We have the tools to do it.",
      "\"We just can't sustain somebody sick for a really long period of time, just for a few days, perhaps. But pretty much any medical event that you can imagine ... could happen up there, yeah.\"",
      "Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, said Crew 11 will follow normal procedures when returning to Earth where they will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast. SpaceX support crews and NASA flight surgeons will be standing by aboard the company's Crew Dragon recovery ship. The crew will be flown to shore by helicopter and then fly by jet back to the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"As Dr. Polk mentioned, it's the first time we've done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle, so that is unusual,\" Kshatriya said. \"What's important to us is the whole crew, and we don't want to do anything, given the nature of the condition, that we put any other additional risk on the crew by diverging from our normal processes. So that's why we're doing essentially a controlled expedited return.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven. Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flier gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "Because of the ever-present chance that a Soyuz or Crew Dragon might have to depart early, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon.",
      "The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one spacecraft depart early and take all its crew members with it.",
      "For that reason, after Crew 11 undocks from the station, NASA will still have one astronaut \u2014 Chris Williams \u2014   aboard to operate systems in the lab's U.S. modules. He was launched to the outpost in November aboard a Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "A one-time volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician with a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, Williams was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams would be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are scheduled for launch Feb. 15.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for takeoff as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",
      "The high-profile Artemis 2 mission will be the first to send astronauts to the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years. Isaacman said he did not think the early return of Crew 11 and the possibly early launch of Crew 12 would have any impact on the moon mission.",

    "story": [
      "A spacewalk planned for Thursday outside the International Space Station was called off late Wednesday because of a \"medical concern\" with an unidentified crew member, NASA said in a statement.",
      "An update shortly before midnight said the agency was exploring \"all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew 11's mission.\"",
      "\"These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely,\" the update said. \"We will provide further updates within the next 24 hours.\"",
      "While NASA did not identify the astronaut in question or explain the medical issue \u2014 standard practice due to privacy concerns \u2014 the agency said \"the matter involved a single crew member who is stable.\"",
      "Space station commander Mike Fincke, flight engineer Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov launched to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship on August. 1.",
      "Going into the new year, the crew expected to remain in space until their replacements arrive in mid-February. Crew 11's return to Earth is expected around Feb. 20. That's still the official plan.",
      "In the meantime, Cardman, 38, and Fincke, 58, a veteran of nine spacewalks on earlier missions, were planning to venture outside the station Thursday to finish building a truss needed to support a set of roll-out solar arrays and to carry out other planned maintenance.",
      "A second spacewalk by two yet-to-be-announced astronauts was planned for next week.",
      "But NASA called off the the first spacewalk earlier Wednesday, saying \"the agency is monitoring a medical concern with a crew member that arose Wednesday afternoon. Due to medical privacy, it is not appropriate for NASA to share more details about the crew member.\"",
      "\"The situation is stable. NASA will share additional details, including a new date for the upcoming spacewalk, later.\"",
      "In a brief space-to-ground radio exchange just after 2:30 p.m. EST, Yui called mission control in Houston and asked for a private medical conference, or PMC.",
      "Mission control replied that a PMC, using a private radio channel, would be set up momentarily. Yui then asked if a flight surgeon was available and if flight controllers had a live camera view from inside the station.",
      "\"Houston, do we still have, like, a camera view in Node 2, uh, 3, lab?\" Yui asked.",
      "\"We don't have any internal cameras right now, but we can put the lab view in if you'd like,\" the mission control communicator replied.",
      "\"I appreciate that,\" Yui replied. He then asked: \"Do you have like a crew surgeon? ... A flight surgeon?\"",
      "No additional exchanges were heard. Later Wednesday, NASA's space station audio stream, normally carried live around-the-clock on YouTube, went silent without explanation.",

    "summary": "Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as its new president and vice chairman.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.",
      "Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors \u2014 where, the company notes, she was \"deeply engaged\" in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.",
      "The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of President Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a \"great choice\" by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 and noted that Powell McCormick had \"served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.\"",
      "Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick's experience in global finance, \"combined with her deep relationships around the world,\" made her \"uniquely suited to help Meta\" in its future growth.",
      "Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Mr. Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush.",
      "She is married to Sen. David McCormick, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush, before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.",
      "And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions \u2014 including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.",
      "According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.",
      "The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Mr. Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Mr. Trump's orbit.",

    "summary": "Jaimee Seitz said her daughter was convinced to take her own life by members of the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shootings, violence and nihilism.",
    "story": [
      "Thirteen-year-old Audree loved to play Nirvana on guitar, draw anime characters and read the series \"Spy School,\" her mother, Jaimee Seitz said.",
      "\"She had her own personality, her own hobbies, her own everything,\" said Seitz, who lives in Kentucky. \"Audree was one of a kind.\"",
      "A week after her 13th birthday, Audree died by suicide. \"I never believed ever my child would take her life,\" said Seitz. \"I believed it was an accident.\"",
      "Days later, a detective called Seitz to tell her that Audree's journal contained drawings of school shooters. On Roblox, Discord and TikTok, she had been interacting with children and adults in the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shooters and encourage violence and self-harm. Seitz said Audree was only 8 years old when she was first exposed to TCC.",
      "\"I think she felt a sense of comfort with this group, with being a part of something, and I believe that they pushed her to do it,\" Seitz said.",
      "Extremism experts classify TCC as a subculture of nihilistic violent extremism, in which participants are not motivated by a particular ideology but instead driven by a generally misanthropic worldview. Some are driven by a desire to achieve notoriety within online communities through violence or self harm, while others target and exploit vulnerable individuals.",
      "The FBI has seen a 300% increase in nihilistic violent extremism cases from September 2024 to September 2025, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. In December, Patel wrote on X that the FBI is pursuing hundreds of nihilistic violent extremism cases, including many from another network called 764.",
      "\"This is one of the most serious issues in America,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "The FBI confirmed to CBS News that it had been in touch with Audree's family, but declined to comment further on her case or answer general inquiries about nihilistic violent extremism.",
      "\"It's something that was so mind blowing \u2014 that it started at such a young age and that she was groomed into this ideology of worshipping school shooters, \" Seitz said. \"It's hard to wrap your head around.\"",
      "What is TCC?",
      "People who identify as being a part of TCC become fascinated with mass killers and develop fan-like behaviors, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works toward solutions to combat extremism.",
      "While the fixation on high-profile killers predates the internet, the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 ushered in a new era of fandom.",
      "\"We've seen this behavior with respect to serial killers and to mass shooters going back well before Columbine, Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the institute, told CBS News. \"What Columbine did was it gave it a distinct aesthetic.\"",
      "TCC fans substitute aesthetics for ideology, according to researchers \u2014 such as dressing in perpetrators' style and taking up their interests, like favorite songs, rather than adopting their particular motivations.",
      "Online, those active in the TCC share violent \"gore\" videos, create and commission fan art of mass shooters and sometimes interact with people plotting attacks, said David Riedman, an assistant professor at Idaho State University who created a database to track school shootings.",
      "Illustrations, video edits and photo collages romanticizing and sympathizing with perpetrators of the Columbine, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook school shootings are easy to find in TCC-tagged posts on platforms including Tumblr, TikTok and X. The community is considered niche \u2014 CBS News identified posts on these platforms with \"likes\" ranging in the thousands.",
      "Riedman said few people in TCC circles will actually go on to commit acts of violence. But a small portion do, with devastating consequences.",
      "Seven recent shootings in U.S. K-12 schools have been linked to TCC, according to Riedman's data. Eleven people were killed and 53 more were injured in the attacks, which took place over the last two years. Five of the shooters took their own lives as well.",
      "Just last month, police charged a 17-year-old in Indiana linked to TCC who was allegedly plotting to carry out an attack. A search of her phone revealed a drawing of the Columbine perpetrators and screenshots from a Discord conversation between her and a friend who encouraged her to livestream an attack, an affidavit obtained by CBS News alleged.",
      "When people active in the TCC carry out shootings, they sometimes become new idols within the community and inspire more violence. The 15-year-old girl behind the\u00a0December 2024 shooting that killed a teacher and a student at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is one example.",
      "A month later, a Tennessee teenager she followed on X shot a student in his school and then himself. Posts from an X account believed to be his encouraged her to livestream the Wisconsin attack, CBS News found. In the days after, he posted defending her and calling her a hero.",
      "In August and September, two more individuals linked to TCC, one in Minnesota and another in Colorado, carried out deadly school shootings before killing themselves. The Colorado perpetrator posted on violent gore sites about previous shootings, the Anti-Defamation League found. YouTube videos posted by the Minnesota perpetrator and reviewed by CBS News showed written references to school shooters \u2014 including the name of the Abundant Life perpetrator \u2014 on his weapons and a journal.",
      "The perpetrator behind the Abundant Life shooting \"wanted that notoriety,\" Zoschak said.",
      "\"It was about her,\" he added. While ideologically motivated violence aims to have an effect on society, he said, \"nihilistic violence is about fulfilling an inward-focused need.\"",
      "How children get pulled in",
      "TCC can hold an appeal for young people who are experiencing bullying or feel like they don't identify with other kids, Riedman said.",
      "\"You start to meet people that will like all of your photos and will share your content and are inviting you to come to their private chats,\" Riedman said. \"Now you have this community that you don't have anywhere else.\"",
      "Seitz said she believes Audree may have been drawn to the group for its embrace of kids who feel alienated from their classmates.",
      "\"It was hard for her to find her spot in seventh grade,\" she said.",
      "Seth, 29, was a part of the TCC community and ran a Columbine blog on Tumblr when he was a teenager. He told CBS News he was struggling with mental illness at the time and identified with the perpetrators of school shootings.",
      "\"I was very angry, and so it's like, oh, OK, here are these people who are angry,\" said Seth, who asked that his last name be withheld. \"They're doing something about it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Tumblr wrote in a statement that the platform \"does not allow content that encourages or incites violence or that glorifies acts of violence or the perpetrators.\"",
      "Seitz wants social media platforms to face accountability. Despite enabling parental controls on Audree's phone, she said, her daughter was steeped in TCC content for years. This fall, she filed suit against Roblox, Discord and TikTok.",
      "The complaint alleges that the apps prioritize user growth over safety and that they are aware that \"the design of their apps makes children easy targets for predatory behavior.\"",
      "In statements to CBS News, spokespeople from each platform wrote that the companies employ technologies to detect harmful content and remove what violates their policies. A Roblox spokesperson said the platform bans \"content or behavior that supports, glorifies, or promotes hate groups, extremist organizations, or their ideologies.\" A Discord spokesperson said \"the actions of extremist groups or extremism behavior have no place on Discord.\"",
      "After CBS News inquired about several TCC-related hashtags, TikTok removed one of them from the platform. A spokesperson also said accounts that promote or glorify violence are taken down and banned.",
      "Seitz said she hadn't heard of TCC before Audree's death, and she never heard her daughter talk about school shooters. But TCC references understood by those in the community can fly under the radar of unknowing parents and peers.",
      "When Seitz searched \"True Crime Community\" on TikTok after Audree's death, drawings she recognized from her daughter flooded the screen.",
      "\"Everything started to click within not even two minutes,\" she said.",
      "She realized cartoon illustrations Audree had drawn depicted the Columbine perpetrators. A previous TikTok username of Audree's had referenced one of them.",
      "There had even been a TCC reference in a T-shirt Audree asked for. The Columbine perpetrators wore T-shirts for a German industrial band. The Wisconsin shooter was pictured in a shirt for the same band, and Audree wanted to wear one too.",
      "After reflecting on the way Audree's phone was positioned when she discovered her after her death, Jaimee also now believes that her daughter was attempting to livestream her suicide \u2014 something Zoschak said he has seen before among TCC fans.",
      "\"Whether you think your child is seemingly happy, you never know,\" Seitz said. \"And that's the scary part of it \u2014 that's what terrifies me the most.\"",
      "A new category of extremism",
      "The misanthropic violence, absent of ideology, exhibited by attackers involved in TCC has been categorized as nihilistic violent extremism \u2014 a term that has increasingly appeared in Justice Department announcements of criminal charges across the country.",
      "Some nihilistic violent extremists carry out violence with the goal of hastening the collapse of society \u2014 a philosophy known as accelerationism.",
      "But for most, experts said, their mindset mostly revolves around nihilism \u2014 the belief that life and society are meaningless and that moral values are baseless.",
      "In recent months, authorities have taken particular note of the nihilistic violent extremist network 764, with more than 300 investigations into the network ongoing, according to the FBI.",
      "Similar to TCC, 764 lacks a specific ideology, but members more openly encourage self-harm and violence than those in TCC do. Perpetrators associated with 764 encourage victims to produce videos documenting acts of self-harm or child sexual abuse material.

    "story": [
      "Meta has cut a trio of deals to power its artificial intelligence data centers, securing enough energy to light up the equivalent of about 5 million homes.",
      "The parent company of Facebook on Friday announced agreements with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra for nuclear power for its Prometheus AI data center that is being built in New Albany, Ohio. Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It's anticipated to come online this year.",
      "Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed.",
      "The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.",
      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.",
      "Meta will also buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio, in addition to the energy from expansions at the two Ohio plants and a third Vistra plant, Beaver Valley, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",
      "The deal with Oklo, which counts OpenAI's Sam Altman as one of its largest investors, will help to develop a 1.2 gigawatt power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta's data centers in the region.",
      "The nuclear power agreements come after Meta announced in June that it reached a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to secure power from its nuclear plant in Clinton, Illinois.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

    "story": [
      "Google on Thursday unveiled new artificial intelligence features in Gmail, an effort by the technology giant to refresh its 22-year-old messaging app amid growing use of AI.",
      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",
      "Google is offering paid Pro and Ultra subscribers access to technology that lets users ask natural-language questions directly in the Gmail search bar. Subscribers will also have access to a dedicated chatbot for follow-up questions.",
      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",
      "Meanwhile, the so-called\u00a0 \"Catch me up\" tool will provide users with reminders of their upcoming events and appointments. This includes but is not limited to upcoming reservations, purchases and deliveries, and cancelled or rescheduled appointments.",
      "How to opt out",
      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section. Users should then uncheck \"Turn on smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet,\" and then save their changes.",

    "story": [
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat finishing out his final term who has at times found himself at odds with his party on key national issues, says the best way to understand his politics is that he is \"pro-freedom.\"",
      "That extends to more benign issues like allowing kids to operate lemonade stands without a permit, to larger concerns like legalizing so-called \"magic mushrooms,\"\u00a0which Polis supported, and vaccine mandates, which Polis opposes.",
      "\"I'm pro-vax, me and my family are vaxxed,\" Polis told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. \"I don't think the government should force you to get vaxxed. ... So, pro-freedom.\"",
      "Asked Monday about the recent changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance on childhood vaccines, recommending fewer immunizations than were previously suggested, Polis said, \"Those are recommendations, obviously.\"",
      "\"We [Colorado] use some of the national recommendations, that, you know, again, it's up to each parent to make that decision for their kids,\" Polis said. \"It's good to put the best possible information in front of people. In most cases, getting vaccinated is the best way to protect your health and your kid's health.\"",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has called the CDC's changes dangerous and said it would continue giving its own guidance.",
      "Asked how Democrats can win back voters who chose to support President Trump because of his campaign promises to give Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a major role in his administration, Polis told CBS News, \"I think Democrats should be the party of health.\"",
      "He said a main component of that is making health care more affordable, but he lamented that Democrats have not been as vocal about issues like \"the dangers of highly processed foods,\" healthy school meals, and insecticides, as some Republicans have been.",
      "\"Remember, it's nobody's goal to have to have health care. It's your goal to just stay healthy, and a lot of that comes down to diet, nutrition and exercise,\" Polis said. \"And it shouldn't he a partisan message. Colorado has the lowest obesity rate of any state. We're proud of that. We have a great outdoor lifestyle. That's something that we should really take across the country.\"",
      "Asked how far his \"pro-freedom\" stance goes, Polis said, \"I'm not an anarchist.\"",
      "\"We have rights. Fundamental rights. ... When you're minding your business and doing your own thing, really, the government shouldn't interfere,\" he said. \"When you start interfering with your neighbors and those around you, there's a very appropriate role of government to step in and say, 'They deserve their freedom too.'\"",
      "Polis' interview comes amid the Trump administration's attempts to deny Colorado and some other Democratic-led states billions of dollars in social service funding over allegations of fraud \u2014 allegations that have, in part, led to the surge of federal agents in Minneapolis, where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good last week.",
      "\"We welcome any way to look at fraud and defeat it. I mean, we see the federal government as a partner in that,\" Polis said. \"Freezing it [the funding] before they found any fraud, that's really inappropriate.\"",

      "Polis said that, during his time in office, national politics have become \"more vitriolic.\"",
      "\"To step down to the level of personal attacks and undermine the motives of others is really what's dangerous in today's society,\" he said. \"What bothers me the most is the huge gap in perceptions of what Democrats think Republicans believe and what Republicans think Democrats believe.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith is expected to testify publicly in front of the House Judiciary Committee later this month.",
      "GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee's chairman, announced on X Monday that Smith it set to testify on Jan. 22.",
      "Last month, Smith testified in a closed-door deposition for roughly nine hours on Capitol Hill before the committee, which is probing Smith's actions during his time as special counsel in the Biden administration.",
      "The committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of President Trump that Smith oversaw. Republicans on the committee have ramped up their criticism of investigative steps Smith and his office took, including their move to obtain phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers.",
      "Smith's two investigations into Mr. Trump resulted in more than 40 federal charges. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "The committee released a transcript and video of Smith's closed-door testimony last month. The former special counsel defended his prosecutions of Mr. Trump and said he was confident that he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith also rejected suggestions that he brought the cases against Mr. Trump to harm his 2024 presidential campaign, and said the Biden White House was not involved in his investigations.",
      "\"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,\" he said, referring to the 2020 election case. \"These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit.\"",
      "Smith also revealed that his team determined they had evidence to charge some of Mr. Trump's co-conspirators in the election interference case, but said he had not yet made a final decision to do so.",
      "Lanny Breuer, one of Smith's attorneys, said in a statement that his client \"has been clear for months he is ready and willing to answer questions in a public hearing about his investigations into President Trump's alleged unlawful efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents.\"",
      "Jordan initially\u00a0told Politico\u00a0on Friday that he would invite Smith to testify in the coming weeks. A source familiar with the planning confirmed that timeline to CBS News.",
      "Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, welcomed news of Smith's public testimony.",
      "\"After Republicans forced Jack Smith into a backroom interrogation and rejected our calls for an open public hearing, now they decide they want a public hearing with Jack Smith after all,\" Raskin said in a statement last week. \"Their backroom strategy backfired in historic fashion.\"",
      "He added: \"This upcoming hearing is a win for truth-seeking Americans and yet another looming humiliation for Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans, who depend on a daily diet of lies to keep their Administration afloat.\"",
      "Smith had offered to testify publicly before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, as prior special counsels have done, but Jordan, the House panel's chairman, issued a subpoena for Smith's initial testimony to be private.",
      "Lawyers for the former special counsel reiterated their request for Smith to answer questions from lawmakers in a public forum following his deposition.",

    "story": [
      "The suspect charged with setting a fire inside a historic Jackson, Mississippi, synagogue over the weekend admitted it was because of the building's \"Jewish ties,\" according to an FBI criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Mississippi on Monday.",
      "Security footage showed the arson suspect, Stephen Spencer Pittman, inside Beth Israel Congregation around 3 a.m. on Saturday, pouring what appeared to be gasoline, according to the complaint. Pittman was charged with maliciously damaging or destroying a building by means of fire or an explosive.",
      "Authorities said Pittman's father reached out to the FBI, saying his son confessed to starting the fire, which was later corroborated by map data from a location-sharing app Pittman had on his phone. Pittman also texted his father a photo of the back of the synagogue, writing, \"There's a furnace in the back,\" the complaint alleges, noting that his father \"pleaded for his son to return home.\"",
      "Hours later, Pittman's father confronted his son after noticing burns on his ankles. Pittman \"laughed as he told his father what he did and said he finally got them,\" the complaint said.",
      "That evening, investigators at the Jackson Fire Department and Hinds County Sheriff's Office interviewed Pittman, who admitted to starting the fire and called the building \"the synagogue of Satan,\" according to the complaint. He told investigators he stopped to purchase gasoline, removed his license plate and broke into the building through a window with an axe, using a torch lighter to start the fire after pouring gasoline.",
      "\"As we learned that it was arson, the anger really comes to the top of what your mind thinks,\" Beth Israel congregation president Zach Shemper told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Jackson Mayor John Horhn condemned \"acts of antisemitism, racism, and religious hatred,\" which he said will be treated as acts of terror against residents.",
      "\"Targeting people because of their faith, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation is morally wrong, un-American, and completely incompatible with the values of this city,\" he said in a statement posted to social media on Sunday.",
      "Beth Israel, established over 160 years ago, is Jackson's only synagogue and was the first synagogue in the state.",
      "\"We are grateful that he was apprehended so quickly and he appears to have admitted to committing this heinous act out of hatred for the Jewish people,\" Beth Israel said Monday following the release of the criminal complaint. \"This news puts a face and name to this tragedy, but does not change our resolve to proudly - even defiantly - continue Jewish life in Jackson in the face of hatred.\"",
      "In 1967, Beth Israel was bombed by Ku Klux Klan members. Two months later, they bombed the home of the congregation's rabbi as well, according to the Beth Israel website. The rabbi wasn't home at the time and no one was hurt in the bombings.",
      "There are still congregants at the synagogue who were members during those bombings, according to a representative for Beth Israel.",
      "Parts of the building are damaged by water, smoke and soot. The sanctuary, where worship services are held, needs restoration but is still standing. Five Torahs \u2014 the sacred scrolls with the text of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible \u2014 located inside the sanctuary were assessed for damage. Two Torahs inside the library were destroyed. One Torah rescued during the Holocaust and kept behind glass was undamaged.",
      "The attack on Beth Israel comes amid a nationwide spike in antisemitism. There's been an 893% increase over the past decade in antisemitic incidents, according to the Anti-Defamation League. A 2024 audit by ADL recorded more than\u00a0 9,000 incidents - it's the highest number recorded since the organization began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1980.",
      "\"We are still assessing the damage to the building, but will be continuing our worship services and other programs \u2013 locations to be determined,\" Shemper said in an earlier statement to CBS News, adding that several churches have offered their spaces for worship.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department Friday stemming from a criminal investigation into its chair, Jerome Powell, he said in a video statement Sunday.",
      "The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025, according to Powell.",
      "\"That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" Powell said.",
      "The project and Powell's testimony came under scrutiny by the Trump administration last year, with Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought accusing Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "In his testimony to the Senate, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens, disputing claims made by Vought.",
      "\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one \u2014 certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve \u2014 is above the law,\" Powell said Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,\" Powell said.",
      "U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro said on X Monday that her office \"contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman's congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process\u2014which is not a threat.\"",
      "\"The word 'indictment' has come out of Mr. Powell's mouth, no one else's,\" Pirro said. \"None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach.\"",
      "Video message from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell: https://t.co/5dfrkByGyX pic.twitter.com/O4ecNaYaGH",
      "In a statement, a Department of Justice spokesperson said Attorney General Pam Bondi \"has instructed her U.S. Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars,\" but did not refer to any specific case.",
      "President Trump told NBC News Sunday night he didn't know about the Powell probe. \"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he remarked.",
      "Bloomberg reported\u00a0on Monday that Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte was the instigator behind the Powell subpeona. Pulte said Monday that the Justice Department is \"out of my purview,\" and he didn't \"know anything about it.\" The\u00a0Government Accountability Office is investigating Pulte for his actions\u00a0at the helm of FHFA, which the GAO said in December includes \"referrals of New York Attorney General Letitia James, U.S. Senator Adam Schiff, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, and Congressman Eric Swalwell to the U.S. Department of Justice for mortgage fraud.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council chief Kevin Hassett, rumored to be one of Mr. Trump's top choices to replace Powell when his term is up at the Fed this year, said Monday morning that he \"respects the independence of the Justice Department and the Fed.\"",
      "Asked if he was worried about volatility in the markets due to the Fed tumult, Hassett said: \"I would expect that the markets would be happy to see that there's more transparency at the Fed.\"",
      "Bipartisan criticism",
      "Senators from both sides of the aisle blasted the investigation.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, said in a statement that, \"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question. I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed\u2014including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy\u2014until this legal matter is fully resolved.\"",
      "Tillis sits on the Senate Banking Committee, which will hold confirmation hearings and vote on the president's pick to replace Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve. The committee has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so his opposition could prevent the committee from advancing the nomination for a full Senate vote.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the probe \"an assault on the Fed's independence.\"",
      "\"This is the kind of bullying that we've all come to expect from Donald Trump and his cronies. Anyone who is independent and doesn't just fall in line behind Trump gets investigated,\" Schumer said on social media.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, agrees that the committee and the Senate shouldn't advance any Trump nominee for the Fed, including the Fed chair.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns on \"The Takeout,\" Warren noted that Powell had called the Justice Department's investigation a pretext intended to enable Mr. Trump to be able to seize control of the Fed.",
      "\"Congress does not have to roll over and play dead,\" Warren said. \"If the Republicans will join the Democrats, we can basically block the president from putting anyone new in and thwart him in his efforts to take over the Fed. But it will take having enough Republicans who have enough of a spine to stand up and make that happen.\"",
      "And Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat form Virginia who also sits on the Banking Committee, issued a statement saying, \"The Fed was designed to operate independently, insulated from political pressure, so that it can make tough decisions based on data and the long-term health of the economy, not the whims of any one president. ... Uncertainty and instability can ripple through the economy, affecting borrowing costs and making it harder for families to buy a home, run a small business, or afford everyday necessities like food, fuel, and diapers.\"",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump\u00a0during his first term, replacing Janet Yellen, an appointment of President Barack Obama, and the Senate\u00a0confirmed Powll\u00a0in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "For months last year, Mr. Trump expressed his unhappiness with the Fed's decision to leave interest rates stable. The president\u00a0argued\u00a0that inflation was already low enough to start cutting rates. It wasn't until late 2025 that the Fed started cutting rates.",
      "The president has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell, including as recently as last month.",
      "Closing out his statement Sunday, Powell said, \"I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. ... I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.\"",

    "story": [
      "The state of Minnesota, along with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, are suing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other federal officials in an effort to stop the surge of federal law enforcement officials coming into the state.",
      "State officials said the lawsuit, filed on Monday, is asking the federal court to \"end the unprecedented surge of DHS agents into the state and declare it unconstitutional and unlawful.\"",
      "\"We allege that the surge, reckless impact on our schools, on our local law enforcement, is a violation of the 10th Amendment and the sovereign laws and powers of the Constitution grants to states,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said while discussing the lawsuit at a news conference on Monday afternoon.",
      "The 10th Amendment states, \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"",
      "According to the lawsuit, Minnesotans have been \"unlawfully seized and been the victims of excessive force by federal immigration agents for exercising their First Amendment rights to observe or protest federal government conduct.\"",
      "The court document also alleges that DHS agents have conducted warrantless arrests, citing an instance on Dec. 5 when a federal agent entered a south Minneapolis restaurant without a warrant. When the general manager of the restaurant asked for it, the agent said, \"We don't need one.\"",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and other state and Twin Cities officials joined Ellison at the news conference.",
      "\"Minneapolis didn't ask for this operation, but we're paying the price,\" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. \"When federal actions undermine public safety, harm our neighbors, and violate constitutional rights, we have a responsibility to act. That's exactly what we're doing today.\"",
      "Her added, \"With this collective action, we are taking a firm stance to tell federal law enforcement that this cannot happen in our country, it cannot happen in our state and it cannot happen in St. Paul.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in response to the lawsuit said, in part, \"This is a baseless lawsuit, and we look forward to proving that in court.\"",
      "Republican Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth and Rep. Harry Niska, R-Ramsey, said in a joint statement that Ellison's office is \"wasting state resources\" and \"seeks to override the federal government's authority to enforce immigration law.\"",
      "Jill Hasday, a law professor with the University of Minnesota, took a closer look at the claims in the cout document.",
      "\"I think a number of them will have some obstacles, but it's possible that some of these, they can get some traction on,\" Hasday said.",
      "She added that the outcome of the lawsuit could have a wider impact.",
      "\"Minnesota's experience, I think, has been shaped by the previous legal battles,\" Hasday said. \"For instance, I think that's probably the likely explanation for why the National Guard hasn't been deployed here, because they had legal obstacles and other cities, and similarly, if some of these claims are successful in this suit, that could potentially cabin other, efforts in other cities, because I think it's fair to say that Minnesota is unlikely to be the last city to face this kind of a immigration enforcement surge.\"",
      "Hasday also said the lawsuit \"very effectively\" states the harm that the plaintiffs feel the ICE surge has placed on the state, both on its residents and the state's government.",
      "The court document comes one day after Noem said that\u00a0hundreds more federal agents\u00a0were headed to Minneapolis, and less than a week after the\u00a0fatal shooting of Renee Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0agent in south Minneapolis on Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration initiated a massive deployment of approximately 2,000 federal agents to the Twin Cities amid a\u00a0widening fraud scandal\u00a0on Jan. 5. The influx involves agents from ICE and Homeland Security Investigations overseeing a 30-day operation. Agents from DHS are expected to probe alleged cases of fraud.",
      "Homeland Security Investigations on Dec. 29 conducted a \"massive investigation\u00a0on child care and other rampant fraud\" in the Twin Cities, according to Noem. Two DHS officials told CBS News that federal agents were expected to inspect over 30 sites. Many of their targets were day care centers referenced in a\u00a0viral video\u00a0posted by conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley.",
      "CBS News conducted its own analysis of nearly 12 day care centers mentioned by Shirley: all but two have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months.",
      "Homeland Security's Operation Metro Surge, which has targeted Somali immigrants in Minnesota, started at the beginning of December. The operation has led to more than 2,000 arrests, according to McLaughlin. Federal agents have also been detaining\u00a0several\u00a0protesters\u00a0and observers.",
      "\"This operation was never about safety, it's a targeted political operation and Minnesota won't stand for it,\" Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota said in response to the lawsuit.",
      "Thousands of people against the presence of ICE agents in Minnesota participated in a\u00a0march and rally in Minneapolis\u00a0on Saturday. It was one of\u00a0many demonstrations that have taken place around the state and the nation\u00a0since the fatal shooting of Good.",
      "\"We don't use the word invasion lightly,\" Frey said on Monday afternoon. \"What we are seeing is thousands, plural, thousands of federal agents coming into our city, and yeah, they're having a tremendous impact on day-to-day life, and it's a negative one. An whether that's kids trying to get to school or businesses that are trying to open, that's police officers responding to 911 calls.\"",
      "Illinois on Monday filed a lawsuit against DHS over what state officials called \"unlawful and dangerous tactics\" used by Customs and Border Protection and ICE agents in the state.",

      "Robert McBride, a former longtime federal prosecutor in Kentucky's Eastern District, had only been on the job as first assistant U.S. Attorney for a few months after joining the office in the fall.

      "Comey, one of President Trump's perceived political foes, was indicted last fall on two counts alleging he provided false testimony to Congress in September 2020.",
      "The indictment was secured solely by Lindsey Halligan, who was hand-picked by Mr. Trump to serve as interim U.S. Attorney after her predecessor declined to pursue criminal charges against Comey or New York Attorney General Letitia James, citing a lack of evidence.",
      "Halligan secured indictments against both Comey and James without any involvement from career prosecutors, who declined to get involved because of the weak evidence in both cases, according to sources familiar with the matter.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will consider whether laws in Idaho and West Virginia banning transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's sports teams violate the Constitution and Title IX.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday is set to consider whether states can forbid transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's sports teams, stepping into a high-stakes fight that has been simmering for years.",
      "Twenty-seven states have enacted laws that prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports. President Trump signed an executive order in February that directed his administration to strip federal funding from programs that allow transgender girls and women to compete on athletic teams that correspond with their gender identity.",
      "On the heels of that directive, the NCAA updated its participation policy for transgender student-athletes, limiting competition in women's sports to only athletes assigned female at birth. Then, last July, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee effectively barred transgender women from competing on women's teams.",
      "The Supreme Court is now poised to wade into the debate over transgender athletes' participation in girls' and women's sports when it convenes Tuesday to hear arguments in two cases involving restrictions from Idaho and West Virginia. The justices are confronted with whether the measures violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and Title IX, the landmark 50-year-old law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities.",
      "Two transgender athletes who challenged their states' laws, Lindsay Hecox and Becky Pepper-Jackson, argue the bans discriminate against them on the basis of sex and transgender status. The laws, they say, categorically exclude all transgender girls and women from school sports altogether, since they're barred from joining the teams that match their gender identity and cannot compete on boys' or men's teams because it would be inconsistent with their gender identity.",
      "\"I play for my school for the same reason other kids on my track team do \u2014 to make friends, have fun, and challenge myself through practice and teamwork,\" Pepper-Jackson said in a video statement. \"And all I've ever wanted was the same opportunities as my peers.\"",
      "But the states argue that their laws do not discriminate based on transgender status, and instead draw permissible distinctions between the sexes. West Virginia and Idaho officials say their bans' sex-based classifications are allowed because they are substantially related to their interest in fair and safe athletic opportunities for women and girls.",
      "\"Every time a male athlete runs as a female, a roster spot is lost to a female. It means it's given to a male. And that's unfair,\" Madison Kenyon, who ran collegiate track and cross-country and competed against a transgender woman, told CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford.",
      "Kenyon continued: \"Those opportunities to compete, to have a scholarship, to gain an education for women, were almost unheard of 50 years ago. Title IX was created to give women equal opportunity, equal spots in sports as men. And when men compete as women, it defeats the purpose of that. It gets rid of our equal opportunity and takes away our ability to get a scholarship and to compete and to get an education. And I experienced that.\"",
      "Idaho's first-in-the-nation law",
      "Idaho was the first state to enact a law banning transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's athletic teams. Called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, the measure requires public school and collegiate sports teams to be designated \"based on biological sex,\" and states that athletic teams designated for females, women or girls \"shall not be open to students of the male sex.\"",
      "If a student's sex is disputed, the law requires the athlete to provide a health examination and consent form that verifies their biological sex at birth.",
      "Hecox, a transgender woman who wanted to compete on the women's track and cross-country teams at Boise State University, filed a lawsuit challenging Idaho's law. She argued the measure was unconstitutional and violated Title IX. Hecox, who receives hormone therapy, tried out for the university's track and cross-country teams but did not make them. She instead participated in women's club soccer and running.",
      "Defending the law are Idaho's attorney general and two athletes, Kenyon and Mary Kate Marshall, who competed on the women's track and cross-country teams at Idaho State University. They\u00a0placed behind a transgender student-athlete in various events in 2019 and early 2020.",
      "\"Stepping on the line, standing next to a male when we're about to race \u2014 it's unfair,\" Marshall told Crawford. \"I don't know how much \u2014 they don't have to put in as much work as I do because of the clear advantages that they have.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge David C. Nye blocked enforcement of the ban in 2020, finding that it \"discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed that decision and concluded that Idaho's ban is likely unconstitutional.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in July to take up the challenge to Idaho's law, as well as West Virginia's. But since then, Hecox, now 25, has sought to have the case dismissed as moot.",
      "Citing \"significant challenges that have affected her both personally and academically,\" as well as \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters\" because of the lawsuit, Hecox's lawyers wrote in a filing that she decided to refrain from playing any women's sports at Boise State University or in Idaho, and would not participate in any school-sponsored athletics covered by Idaho's ban.",
      "The Supreme Court is set to discuss at oral arguments whether to dismiss her case.",
      "West Virginia's law",
      "West Virginia lawmakers enacted the state's ban, called the Save Women's Sports Act, in 2021. Like Idaho's measure, the law requires athletic teams to be designated \"based on biological sex,\" and states that \"athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to students of the male sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.\"",
      "Before the law took effect, Pepper-Jackson wanted to compete on the girls' cross-country and track teams, and sued to block enforcement of the ban against her, arguing it violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. Pepper-Jackson, a 15-year-old transgender girl, began socially transitioning in third grade and has taken puberty-delaying medication and hormone therapy. She is now a sophomore in high school.",
      "In 2023, a U.S. district court upheld the law on both equal protection and Title IX grounds, finding West Virginia's classification based on biological sex is substantially related to its interest in providing equal athletic opportunities for females.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and the Supreme Court blocked West Virginia officials from enforcing the ban against Pepper-Jackson while proceedings continued, with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas in dissent. The 4th Circuit then divided 2-1 in finding that the law violates Title IX because it discriminates based on gender identity, which it said is discrimination on the basis of sex.",
      "The legal battle over transgender athletes",
      "Schools have had sex-separated school sports teams for decades, but Republican-led states began enacting their recent restrictions as a growing number of instances of transgender athletes competing in girls' and women's sporting events came to light.",
      "One openly transgender U.S. athlete competed at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, middle-distance runner Nikki Hiltz, who uses they/them pronouns and was assigned female at birth. NCAA President Charlie Baker told a Senate panel in December 2024 that he was aware of fewer than 10 transgender athletes who were among the 510,000 student-athletes governed by the association.",
      "It's unclear how many transgender athletes are covered by bans in the 27 states that restrict participation in girls' and women's sports. The Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimates that up to 122,000 transgender athletes could be participating in high school athletics.",
      "Pepper-Jackson is the only openly transgender student-athlete in West Virginia, her lawyers say.",
      "But dozens of female athletes competing at the high school and collegiate level told the Supreme Court in filings about their experiences competing against transgender athletes on basketball and volleyball courts, at track meets and in swimming pools.",
      "\"There's quite an unfair advantage that males have on females. And when they compete against women, it ruins the integrity of our sports,\" Kenyon said. \"Running is a mental sport. And when you step on the line and you're racing a male athlete, the race hasn't even started, but it feels like the outcome has already been decided.\"",
      "And Pepper-Jackson's participation in girls' sports in West Virginia has had reverberations, state officials say. They estimate that she displaced at least 400 female athletes in standings in track-and-field events in the spring 2025 season, and she placed third in discus and eighth in shot put at a May state championship meet.",
      "\"In an athletic regime where women are supposed to have the ability to compete fairly against other females, when you put a male in that mix, it's not fair,\" said Jonathan Bursch, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative judicial group that is co-counsel to the states. \"That's why we have girls' sports. And you can't erase those physical differences, even with puberty blockers.\"",
      "In defending the bans, the Alliance Defending Freedom and Idaho officials argue in filings that sex is biological and immutable, and causes the differences between males and females. They say the sports-participation laws are motivated by those physical and physiological differences, and classify based on sex to account for those distinctions.",
      "\"While these cases are simply about upholding these 27 state laws, it's really about restoring common sense, fairness and safety in sports and beyond based on biological reality,\" Bursch told CBS News.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, West Virginia Solicitor General Michael Williams and state officials said the 4th Circuit's decision requires states to treat sex and gender identity as synonymous when it comes to sports.",
      "\"Sex affects athletic performance; gender identity does not,\" West Virginia lawyers wrote. \"If the court below were right, then Title IX's role in preserving girls' sports opportunities would end.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Hecox's lawyers first argue her case should be dismissed because she has stopped playing any sports covered by the ban. Lawyers for the two athletes also refute that Idaho and West Virginia's laws are substantially related to their interests in promoting equality and safety in female athletics. Hecox and Pepper-Jackson have no athletic advantage over competitors because of the medical treatments they've received, they say.",
      "\"The statutory text, history, and purpose lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Act intentionally treats transgender women and girls differently \u2014 and worse \u2014 by categorically barring them from playing women's and girls' sports,\" Hecox's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "In West Virginia's case, Pepper-Jackson's legal team says in court papers that Title IX does not authorize the \"wholesale exclusion\" of transgender girls from athletics. They argue the state's restriction subjects Pepper-Jackson to discrimination because it denies her equal access to athletics.",
      "\"The question before the court is straightforward: Does the law permit West Virginia to categorically exclude transgender students from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity? And the answer is no,\" Sasha Buchert, director of the Transgender & Nonbinary Rights Project at Lambda Legal, told reporters. \"These young people deserve the same opportunities, the same dignity and the same chance to grow through sports that we afford to all students.\"",
      "The Trump administration is backing West Virginia and Idaho in the cases. In a friend-of-the-court brief, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the practice of sex-separated sports is justified for transgender athletes because physiological differences between males and females are unrelated to gender identity and are not eliminated by medical interventions like puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "\"In short, the laws of West Virginia and Idaho place trans-identifying athletes on sports teams on the same valid, biology-based terms as everyone else,\" Sauer wrote. \"That is the definition of equal treatment. It is not gender-identity discrimination at all, much less sex discrimination.\"",

      "The pair of disputes over transgender athletes' participation in girls' and women's sports are the latest involving LGBTQ rights that have landed before the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2020, the justices divided 6-3 to expand protections from workplace discrimination under Title VII to transgender and gay employees, with Justice Neil Gorsuch authoring the majority opinion. Lawyers for Pepper-Jackson argue that the court's reasoning in that case should extend to Title IX, which uses similar language.",
      "\"Just as discriminating against a transgender person in employment is sex discrimination under Title VII, it's also sex discrimination under Title IX, and when Becky is prevented from being on teams with other girls like her, she is subjected to discrimination that effectively excludes her from participating in the school's educational programs,\" Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU's LGBT & HIV Project, told reporters. Block will be arguing on behalf of Pepper-Jackson before the Supreme Court.",
      "But Bursch, of the Alliance Defending Freedom, said that under Title VII, sex isn't supposed to be a factor in whether a person is hired, fired, promoted or disciplined. In the context of Title IX, though, sex has to be considered, otherwise there wouldn't be male and female sports teams, he said.",
      "\"When you're talking about a statute that requires consideration of sex, then all of a sudden, sex discrimination means something very different than it does in Title VII,\" he said. \"And if the court were to adopt the Bostock reasoning in Title IX, it would completely destroy male and female sports teams.\"",
      "Most recently, in its last term, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law barring medical interventions for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. The high court found that the law does not rely on sex-based classifications, but instead draws lines based on medical use and age.",
      "The Supreme Court has also allowed Mr. Trump to temporarily enforce policies banning transgender people from serving in the military and requiring passports to reflect the holder's biological sex at birth. Both cases landed before the high court in their early stages, and the Supreme Court has not yet been asked to decide the legal merits.",

      "Walmart plans to expand its drone delivery service in the next two years, giving customers the option to place aerial orders from hundreds of additional store locations.",
      "The retail giant will offer drone deliveries for groceries and other store items through its partnership with Alphabet-owned drone operator Wing at an additional 150 stores in 2026, Wing announced on Sunday, calling it the \"world's largest drone delivery expansion.\"",
      "This comes after Walmart announced plans last year to launch drone deliveries at another 100 stores. Walmart, which already provides drone-based delivery from\u00a0some locations in Texas\u00a0and in the\u00a0Atlanta metro area, plans to expand the service to a total of 270 U.S. locations by the end of 2027.",

      "Home drone deliveries have slowly been gaining momentum since 2019, when the Federal Aviation Administration\u00a0approved\u00a0aerial commercial package deliveries.

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly filed a lawsuit against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seeking to block the Pentagon's efforts to downgrade his retirement rank and pay.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona filed a civil lawsuit against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday seeking to block the Pentagon's efforts to downgrade his retirement rank and pay, which he claims amounts to unconstitutional retaliation against him.",
      "In a 46-page complaint, Kelly, a retired Navy captain, argued that he is the target of \"extreme rhetoric and punitive retribution\" by the Trump administration over a video in which he and other lawmakers urged members of the military to \"refuse illegal orders.\" Kelly asked a federal judge to set aside Hegseth's recent moves\u00a0and block the enforcement of any punishment against him.",
      "The Arizona Democratic senator alleged that he was punished for protected speech and said administration officials retaliated against him in violation of the First Amendment. Kelly also argued that his criticisms of Hegseth are at the core of the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, which provides immunity to lawmakers from criminal prosecutions or civil lawsuits that stem from legislative acts.",
      "\"It appears that never in our nation's history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,\" Kelly's legal team wrote in the complaint. \"Allowing that unprecedented step here would invert the constitutional structure by subordinating the Legislative Branch to executive discipline and chilling congressional oversight of the armed forces.\"",
      "They said Kelly's public statements and legislative acts in response to the Trump administration's actions regarding the military are \"significant matters of public concern\" that fit within the First Amendment's protections and his oversight responsibilities as a senator. The senator's lawyers added that they believe there is no legal basis to take action against him based on \"post-retirement political speech.\"",
      "Kelly said in a statement that Hegseth's efforts to punish him leave military veterans at risk of seeing their rank and pay downgraded years after they retire for making comments that he or other defense secretaries dislike.",
      "\"His unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: if you speak out and say something that the President or Secretary of Defense doesn't like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted,\" Kelly said.",
      "Kelly and his colleagues came under fierce criticism by the Trump administration after they posted the video in November. The video was published amid the military buildup around Venezuela and strikes against alleged drug boats, and featured five other Democratic lawmakers who served in the U.S. military or in the intelligence community. They have not faced any adverse action from the Defense Department as they do not draw retirement pay from the U.S. military.",
      "President Trump and Hegseth lambasted the lawmakers for the comments, claiming that their statements amounted to \"sedition\" and \"treason.\"",
      "Hegseth claimed Kelly's statements \"undermined the chain of command\" and constituted \"conduct unbecoming an officer.\" The Pentagon\u00a0announced it was conducting a review of misconduct allegations against Kelly to determine whether he should be recalled to active duty to face court-martial proceedings.",
      "The Defense Department said in December it was \"escalating\" its review into a command investigation.",
      "Hegseth announced\u00a0last week that the Pentagon had \"initiated retirement grade determination proceedings\" that could result in a \"reduction in his retired grade\" and \"a corresponding reduction in retired pay.\" Hegseth also said he issued a formal letter to censure Kelly, citing his \"reckless misconduct.\"",
      "\"This Censure is a necessary process step, and will be placed in Captain Kelly's official and permanent military personnel file,\" Hegseth added.",
      "Under federal law, retired U.S. military members can receive non-judicial punishments or even be charged, court-martialed and punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the system of rules and regulations established by Congress governing the military.",

      "Scott's contribution is the largest single donation made to The Trevor Project in its 27-year history, the organization's chief executive officer, Jaymes Black, said.",
      "Black, who called the gift \"transformational,\" said it comes as research points to a worsening mental health crisis among LGBTQ youth in the United States.",
      "\"This gift is a powerful step toward building on our sustainable capacity \u2014 but our organization will continue to face one of the largest public health crises of our time: LGBTQ+ youth suicide,\" Black said in a statement. \"Our organization must continue to innovate and connect with more LGBTQ+ young people in crises. And that requires ongoing support from those who believe in our mission.\"",
      "Black told the Associated Press that \"it took some time\" to process the magnitude of Scott's donation.",
      "\"I literally could not believe it,\" Black said.",
      "Results of a study released by The Trevor Project in October found that LGBTQ youth experienced declining mental health over a period of about 18 months, from September 2023 to March 2025. The study followed more than 1,600 LGBTQ young people around the U.S. and reported increasing rates of anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts among them over time.",
      "Those results compounded already existing research that showed LGBTQ young people were at least four times as likely to attempt suicide compared with their peers outside of the LGBTQ community.",
      "Black said The Trevor Project will invest Scott's funding \"with great care\" and plans to release an investment plan in the coming months that focuses on bolstering its crisis support services\u00a0and \"accelerating our progress toward a world where every LGBTQ+ young person knows they are loved and supported.\"",
      "The Trump administration last summer terminated part of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to LGBTQ youth, which directly impacted The Trevor Project. At the time, the organization said it would lose an estimated $25 million in federal funding as a result of the decision.",

      "Bovino claimed in an interview with CBS News that agencies within the Department of Homeland Security are working to de-escalate situations, saying, \"every day we de-escalate.\"",
      "CBS News witnessed agents confronting the protesters outside of the facility, telling demonstrators to move back and antagonizing them. CBS News pointed out to Bovino that it didn't look like de-escalation.",

      "Frey, Minneapolis' mayor, had a strongly worded message for federal immigration officials after Good was killed, saying at a news conference: \"Get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\" He also told CBS News Minnesota on Sunday, \"you would hope that, especially following some form of awful and horrific event like that, that they would take a step back, take a pause, and then, even better, leave. We have not seen that.\"",

      "Federal law enforcement is conducting at-large sweeps of neighborhoods in Minnesota, an approach that current and former ICE agents said could put citizens and law enforcement at risk. Bovino disputes those claims.",
      "\"We've been at this eight months, so we take that eight months of institutional knowledge along with some of the most highly trained federal law enforcement professionals in terms of immigration and general law enforcement anywhere in the United States,\" he said. \"I can't think of a better law enforcement group that I would rather be with than... than what we have on the ground here.\"",
      "Jonathan Ross is \"in a safe location,\" Bovino says",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 11:32:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Economists say high home prices and a shortage of available properties may limit how much federal action can lower U.S. housing costs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump last week proposed two policies aimed at reducing the cost of buying a home, as soaring prices and elevated mortgage rates make homeownership increasingly unattainable for many Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump said he plans to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, and is also directing the federal government to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds to drive down mortgage rates for Americans.",
      "\"It is one of my many steps in restoring Affordability,\" Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 8 social media post of the proposed mortgage debt purchase.",
      "Buying a home has become far more expensive in recent years as home prices have surged, driven by a shortage of affordable housing and, since 2022, rising mortgage rates. But because many of those pressures lie beyond the federal government's direct control, it's unclear how much Mr. Trump's proposals could ultimately lower costs, according to experts.",
      "America's housing shortage",
      "Mr. Trump's approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes from institutional investors. Yet experts say these strategies will do little to address one of the housing market's thorniest problems: a shortage of homes for sale.",
      "The supply issue partly reflects years of underbuilding after the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the reluctance of homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during the ensuing recession to relinquish their properties.",
      "\"There is an undersupply of housing in the U.S., and that will take time to resolve,\" Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy for TD Securities, told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address the housing shortage, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of housing and communities at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News that the housing market's supply challenges could be harder to address.",
      "\"Most solutions to create new housing take a long time to come to fruition,\" she said.",
      "For example, high land costs make it hard to add to the housing supply. One solution, \u00a0Ratcliffe said, would be to change local zoning rules so more homes can be squeezed into a given area. Yet such policies are set at the local level, not by the federal government, she noted.",
      "Why lower mortgage rates aren't a panacea",
      "Because Mr. Trump's policies address the demand side of the equation, they could inadvertently drive up home prices, Goldberg said. For instance, a decline in mortgage rates could draw more buyers into the market, pushing home prices higher and exacerbating the supply problem.",
      "\"If consumers are able to afford more homes because monthly payments are lower, home prices tend to rise more quickly,\" the analyst told CBS News. \"So simply lowering the cost of buying a home through the mortgage channel isn't sufficient to fix the problem in the long run.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's plan to ban big investors, such as Invitation Homes and financial giant Blackstone, from hoovering up single-family homes might have only a limited effect on the market, according to Goldberg. The reason: investors that own at least 100 properties account for only roughly 1% of the total single-family housing stock in the U.S., according to the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"That's a relatively small impact,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Mr. Trump also hasn't said whether institutional investors would be required to sell the homes they currently own, he pointed out. If those firms are not forced to put those properties on the market, a ban is unlikely to significantly expand the supply of homes, Goldberg said.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump's policies could make a small difference, some housing market experts said.",
      "\"Mortgages will be a little cheaper, and housing will be a little more affordable,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, told CBS News, adding that banning institutional investors from scooping up homes could \"bring prices down a little.\"",
      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points, which could \"spur more spending activity.\"",
      "The upshot: Meaningful progress will require tackling the shortage of available homes, economists agreed. Unless that issue is addressed, the housing affordability crunch will persist, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "\"We need to either activate the existing supply that is underutilized, or take steps to allow the building of new homes,\" Pinto said. \"We need to come up with supply-side solutions that take effect quickly.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:28:09 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 08:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Jaimee Seitz said her daughter was convinced to take her own life by members of the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shootings, violence and nihilism.",
    "story": [
      "Thirteen-year-old Audree loved to play Nirvana on guitar, draw anime characters and read the series \"Spy School,\" her mother, Jaimee Seitz said.",
      "\"She had her own personality, her own hobbies, her own everything,\" said Seitz, who lives in Kentucky. \"Audree was one of a kind.\"",
      "A week after her 13th birthday, Audree died by suicide. \"I never believed ever my child would take her life,\" said Seitz. \"I believed it was an accident.\"",
      "Days later, a detective called Seitz to tell her that Audree's journal contained drawings of school shooters. On Roblox, Discord and TikTok, she had been interacting with children and adults in the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shooters and encourage violence and self-harm. Seitz said Audree was only 8 years old when she was first exposed to TCC.",
      "\"I think she felt a sense of comfort with this group, with being a part of something, and I believe that they pushed her to do it,\" Seitz said.",
      "Extremism experts classify TCC as a subculture of nihilistic violent extremism, in which participants are not motivated by a particular ideology but instead driven by a generally misanthropic worldview. Some are driven by a desire to achieve notoriety within online communities through violence or self harm, while others target and exploit vulnerable individuals.",
      "The FBI has seen a 300% increase in nihilistic violent extremism cases from September 2024 to September 2025, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. In December, Patel wrote on X that the FBI is pursuing hundreds of nihilistic violent extremism cases, including many from another network called 764.",
      "\"This is one of the most serious issues in America,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "The FBI confirmed to CBS News that it had been in touch with Audree's family, but declined to comment further on her case or answer general inquiries about nihilistic violent extremism.",
      "\"It's something that was so mind blowing \u2014 that it started at such a young age and that she was groomed into this ideology of worshipping school shooters, \" Seitz said. \"It's hard to wrap your head around.\"",
      "What is TCC?",
      "People who identify as being a part of TCC become fascinated with mass killers and develop fan-like behaviors, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works toward solutions to combat extremism.",
      "While the fixation on high-profile killers predates the internet, the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 ushered in a new era of fandom.",
      "\"We've seen this behavior with respect to serial killers and to mass shooters going back well before Columbine, Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the institute, told CBS News. \"What Columbine did was it gave it a distinct aesthetic.\"",
      "TCC fans substitute aesthetics for ideology, according to researchers \u2014 such as dressing in perpetrators' style and taking up their interests, like favorite songs, rather than adopting their particular motivations.",
      "Online, those active in the TCC share violent \"gore\" videos, create and commission fan art of mass shooters and sometimes interact with people plotting attacks, said David Riedman, an assistant professor at Idaho State University who created a database to track school shootings.",
      "Illustrations, video edits and photo collages romanticizing and sympathizing with perpetrators of the Columbine, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook school shootings are easy to find in TCC-tagged posts on platforms including Tumblr, TikTok and X. The community is considered niche \u2014 CBS News identified posts on these platforms with \"likes\" ranging in the thousands.",
      "Riedman said few people in TCC circles will actually go on to commit acts of violence. But a small portion do, with devastating consequences.",
      "Seven recent shootings in U.S. K-12 schools have been linked to TCC, according to Riedman's data. Eleven people were killed and 53 more were injured in the attacks, which took place over the last two years. Five of the shooters took their own lives as well.",
      "Just last month, police charged a 17-year-old in Indiana linked to TCC who was allegedly plotting to carry out an attack. A search of her phone revealed a drawing of the Columbine perpetrators and screenshots from a Discord conversation between her and a friend who encouraged her to livestream an attack, an affidavit obtained by CBS News alleged.",
      "When people active in the TCC carry out shootings, they sometimes become new idols within the community and inspire more violence. The 15-year-old girl behind the\u00a0December 2024 shooting that killed a teacher and a student at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is one example.",
      "A month later, a Tennessee teenager she followed on X shot a student in his school and then himself. Posts from an X account believed to be his encouraged her to livestream the Wisconsin attack, CBS News found. In the days after, he posted defending her and calling her a hero.",
      "In August and September, two more individuals linked to TCC, one in Minnesota and another in Colorado, carried out deadly school shootings before killing themselves. The Colorado perpetrator posted on violent gore sites about previous shootings, the Anti-Defamation League found. YouTube videos posted by the Minnesota perpetrator and reviewed by CBS News showed written references to school shooters \u2014 including the name of the Abundant Life perpetrator \u2014 on his weapons and a journal.",
      "The perpetrator behind the Abundant Life shooting \"wanted that notoriety,\" Zoschak said.",
      "\"It was about her,\" he added. While ideologically motivated violence aims to have an effect on society, he said, \"nihilistic violence is about fulfilling an inward-focused need.\"",
      "How children get pulled in",
      "TCC can hold an appeal for young people who are experiencing bullying or feel like they don't identify with other kids, Riedman said.",
      "\"You start to meet people that will like all of your photos and will share your content and are inviting you to come to their private chats,\" Riedman said. \"Now you have this community that you don't have anywhere else.\"",
      "Seitz said she believes Audree may have been drawn to the group for its embrace of kids who feel alienated from their classmates.",
      "\"It was hard for her to find her spot in seventh grade,\" she said.",
      "Seth, 29, was a part of the TCC community and ran a Columbine blog on Tumblr when he was a teenager. He told CBS News he was struggling with mental illness at the time and identified with the perpetrators of school shootings.",
      "\"I was very angry, and so it's like, oh, OK, here are these people who are angry,\" said Seth, who asked that his last name be withheld. \"They're doing something about it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Tumblr wrote in a statement that the platform \"does not allow content that encourages or incites violence or that glorifies acts of violence or the perpetrators.\"",
      "Seitz wants social media platforms to face accountability. Despite enabling parental controls on Audree's phone, she said, her daughter was steeped in TCC content for years. This fall, she filed suit against Roblox, Discord and TikTok.",
      "The complaint alleges that the apps prioritize user growth over safety and that they are aware that \"the design of their apps makes children easy targets for predatory behavior.\"",
      "In statements to CBS News, spokespeople from each platform wrote that the companies employ technologies to detect harmful content and remove what violates their policies. A Roblox spokesperson said the platform bans \"content or behavior that supports, glorifies, or promotes hate groups, extremist organizations, or their ideologies.\" A Discord spokesperson said \"the actions of extremist groups or extremism behavior have no place on Discord.\"",
      "After CBS News inquired about several TCC-related hashtags, TikTok removed one of them from the platform. A spokesperson also said accounts that promote or glorify violence are taken down and banned.",
      "Seitz said she hadn't heard of TCC before Audree's death, and she never heard her daughter talk about school shooters. But TCC references understood by those in the community can fly under the radar of unknowing parents and peers.",
      "When Seitz searched \"True Crime Community\" on TikTok after Audree's death, drawings she recognized from her daughter flooded the screen.",
      "\"Everything started to click within not even two minutes,\" she said.",
      "She realized cartoon illustrations Audree had drawn depicted the Columbine perpetrators. A previous TikTok username of Audree's had referenced one of them.",
      "There had even been a TCC reference in a T-shirt Audree asked for. The Columbine perpetrators wore T-shirts for a German industrial band. The Wisconsin shooter was pictured in a shirt for the same band, and Audree wanted to wear one too.",
      "After reflecting on the way Audree's phone was positioned when she discovered her after her death, Jaimee also now believes that her daughter was attempting to livestream her suicide \u2014 something Zoschak said he has seen before among TCC fans.",
      "\"Whether you think your child is seemingly happy, you never know,\" Seitz said. \"And that's the scary part of it \u2014 that's what terrifies me the most.\"",
      "A new category of extremism",
      "The misanthropic violence, absent of ideology, exhibited by attackers involved in TCC has been categorized as nihilistic violent extremism \u2014 a term that has increasingly appeared in Justice Department announcements of criminal charges across the country.",
      "Some nihilistic violent extremists carry out violence with the goal of hastening the collapse of society \u2014 a philosophy known as accelerationism.",
      "But for most, experts said, their mindset mostly revolves around nihilism \u2014 the belief that life and society are meaningless and that moral values are baseless.",
      "In recent months, authorities have taken particular note of the nihilistic violent extremist network 764, with more than 300 investigations into the network ongoing, according to the FBI.",
      "Similar to TCC, 764 lacks a specific ideology, but members more openly encourage self-harm and violence than those in TCC do. Perpetrators associated with 764 encourage victims to produce videos documenting acts of self-harm or child sexual abuse material. Last month, lawmakers introduced a bill that would make it a federal crime to coerce children into self-harm.",
      "Nihilistic online communities like TCC and 764 are also often overlapping.",
      "\"They're all aware of each other,\" Zoschak said. \"It's not like these are isolated ecosystems \u2014 they interact with each other.\"",
      "Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, estimates that there are about 10,000 nihilistic violent extremism perpetrators involved in online grooming around the world \u2014 and 100,000 victims. He said these extremist networks are constantly growing as members try to recruit more victims, and the law enforcement response is further complicated by the younger age groups involved.",
      "\"We do not charge 13-year-old children with adult-level crimes on a regular basis,\" Kriner said.",
      "Seth, who left TCC after seeking mental health treatment, said it's important for children who feel drawn to the TCC community as an outlet to know that there are other options.",
      "\"I got really into art after I left the community, I got into writing,\" he said. \"That was a dark period of my life, but it doesn't need to define you.\"",

      "\"Hamnet\" won Best Motion Picture - Drama, and \"One Battle After Another\" won Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. (See a full list of this year's winners here.)",
      "Here are the highlights and memorable moments from the Golden Globes, from historic wins to powerful speeches.",
      "Nikki Glaser returns as host",
      "Glaser made history last year as the first woman to host the Golden Globes solo. This year, she took it upon herself to hand out an award for Best Editing to the Justice Department during her opening monologue, alluding to the redactions and delayed release of the Epstein files.",
      "\"I cannot believe the amount of star power we have in this room tonight. It's insane,\" Glaser said. \"There are so many A-listers, and by A-list I do mean 'a list that has been heavily redacted.' And the Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department. Yes. Congratulations.\"",
      "The comedian, who stole the show at 2024's \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" also cracked jokes about Kevin Hart's height and Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriends, and asked George Clooney to fix her Nespresso machine, poking fun at one of the actor's endorsement deals.",
      "Glaser closed out the night wearing a \"Spinal Tap\" hat and referencing several famous lines from the film directed by the late Rob Reiner.",

      "Golden Globes get political",
      "Several stars attended Sunday's award show with pins protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement. As she accepted the award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series for her role in \"Hacks,\" Jean Smart wore a \"BE GOOD\" pin in honor of Renee Good, the woman who was killed by an ICE agent last week in Minneapolis.",

      "Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne also wore pins protesting ICE.",

      "When asked whether it's responsible to send Iranians to their deaths by encouraging them to take to the streets as the regime wages a violent crackdown, Pahlavi didn't answer directly, but said: \"This is a war and war has casualties.\"",
      "\"In order to preserve and protect and minimize the death toll, minimize innocent victims yet again be killed by this regime, action is needed,\" he said.",
      "Pahlavi, who has tried to position himself as a transitional leader of Iran, characterized himself as Iranians' voice in the outside world. He has claimed that chants of his name during the protests demonstrate the legitimacy of the role he could play, though it's unclear how much support he actually has inside the country.",
      "\"Why is it that I offer my service to Iran? I'm answering their call,\" he said. \"I'm a bridge and not the destination at this point.\"",
      "Pahlavi hasn't set foot in Iran in nearly 50 years. But asked if he was willing to die for the cause, he said yes, and pointed to the fearlessness of those on the front lines of the protests.",

      "\"Today, the ask is not just for reform, or for that matter, an economic demand. It is now putting an end to this regime. This is really the revolution in its true sense of the world,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A new arrest has been made in connection to the notorious 2023 gold heist in which millions of dollars' worth of gold bars were stolen at Toronto Pearson Airport, Canadian police said Monday.",
      "Officers arrested and charged 43-year-old Arsalan Chaudhary when he arrived at the Toronto airport Monday on a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, police said in a news release.",
      "Chaudhary is charged with theft, two counts of possession of property obtained by crime, and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. He was held for a bail hearing in Brampton, in the greater Toronto area, police said.",
      "On April 17, 2023, a flight from Zurich, Switzerland, landed at the Toronto airport carrying a cargo shipment that included approximately 400 kilograms (about 880 pounds) of .9999 pure gold bars, worth more than $20 million Canadian (about $14.4 million in U.S. dollars), and $2.5 million Canadian in foreign currency.",
      "The shipment was reported missing the following day from the Air Canada warehouse.",
      "The police soon found that a suspect who arrived at the warehouse with a truck and a fake airway bill had loaded the gold shipment onto the truck and stolen it.",
      "The Peel Regional Police, who are responsible for the airport area, launched an investigation they dubbed \"Project 24K.\"",
      "\"This investigation demonstrates the dedication and expertise of Peel Regional Police in tackling complex, high-stakes crime,\" Peel Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah said in a statement.\u00a0 \"Project 24K is a clear example of how our officers, working alongside national and international partners, can disrupt sophisticated criminal activity and hold those responsible accountable. Let it be known: no matter where you try to run or hide, we will find you.\"",
      "According to police, it was the largest gold heist in Canadian history.",
      "To date, 10 people have been charged or are wanted, and two individuals remain outstanding, including one subject to an extradition request who is believed to be in India.",
      "One of the suspects, Durante King-Mclean, was arrested in Pennsylvania in 2023, accused of driving the truck.",
      "The police have recovered less than $100,000 in melted gold and some cash so far.",
      "An investigation by CBS News's Canadian partner, CBC News's Fifth Estate, said that based on documents, authorities believe the heist was planned and executed by a highly organised group that mainly relied on an insider.",

    "story": [
      "Despite President Trump's social media pronouncement Sunday that \"there will be no more oil or money going to Cuba \u2014 zero,\" the current U.S. policy is to allow Mexico to continue to provide oil to the island, according to Energy Secretary Chris Wright and another U.S. official.",
      "Cuba desperately needs the oil, since Venezuela is no longer supplying it, after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's ouster just over a week ago.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Monday morning. The White House and Mexican government have not yet said whether Mexico's oil supply to Cuba was discussed.",
      "Mexico, which was providing some oil to Cuba before Maduro's capture by the U.S., has become an especially key fuel supplier to the island since the Venezuelan leader's arrest, which was accompanied by the U.S. interception of vessels carrying oil to Cuba. Sheinbaum has referred to oil as \"humanitarian aid.\"",
      "The U.S. does not seek to trigger a collapse of the Cuban government, but rather seeks to negotiate with Havana to transition away from its authoritarian communist system, according to a U.S. official. Mr. Trump's post Sunday morning threatened Cuba, advising the island to make a deal \"before it is too late.\" It was not immediately clear what kind of deal Mr. Trump is seeking from Cuba or who would lead them. A little later, he reshared a post predicting Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be the next president of Cuba. \"Sounds good to me,\" Mr. Trump commented.",
      "The Cuban regime had a series of defiant responses to Mr. Trump's social media threats.",
      "\"As history demonstrates, relations between the U.S. and Cuba, in order to advance, must be based on International Law rather than on hostility, threats, and economic coercion,\" Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez said on X Monday.",
      "He also denied any current talks were underway.",
      "\"There are no conversations with the U.S. government, except for technical contacts in the migration field,\" D\u00edaz-Canel said in another X post.",
      "The U.S. assesses that a total cutoff or embargo of Cuba would be a shock to Havana's already overtaxed and decrepit electrical grid, which has been suffering from rolling blackouts. Cuba's economic condition is dire \u2014 a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that the regime has been so cash strapped that its leaders were reselling some Venezuelan oil to China, the New York Times first reported. This was exacerbating the ongoing energy shortage on the island even before Maduro's arrest.",
      "That economic strain on Havana intensified, now that it has lost virtually all its patrons, and Russia has been tied up in Ukraine.",
      "The regime was intricately tied to Venezuela: It recently acknowledged the deaths of at least 32 Cubans who were protecting Maduro and were killed in the U.S. raid to capture him. Until now, Cuban officials have denied that its intel and security forces provided personal protection to Maduro, even protecting him from his own people as part of the oil-for-security arrangement between the two governments.",
      "The regime in Havana is under intense strain but has had tremendous staying power to date. That appears to be behind the CIA's mixed assessment of its stability.",
      "In October, the U.S. offered humanitarian aid to Cuba, which would be delivered by local partners, rather than through the government. Cuban and U.S. officials told CBS News it still has not yet arrived.",

    "summary": "As the Earth warms, new shipping routes from one side of the globe to the other are opening around Greenland, making the vast island a strategic priority for superpowers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has said repeatedly that he wants the United States to control Greenland, refusing to take military action off the table and declaring that he will make the semi-autonomous Danish territory part of the U.S. \"one way or the other.\"",
      "Mr. Trump says the U.S. needs to control the vast, largely frozen island that sits mostly inside the Arctic Circle for security reasons, accusing China and Russia of trying to take it over instead.",
      "Greenland's own democratically elected leaders have rejected any U.S. takeover, with the island's government calling it something they \"cannot accept under any circumstance.\"",
      "There are a number of reasons why Greenland is of such intense interest to the Trump administration, including its natural resources \u2014\u00a0 reserves of oil, natural gas and rare earth minerals. But the physical location of the island on the map \u2014 and the sea ice melting around its borders \u2014 is also of vital importance.",
      "New routes around the globe",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea Route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a much shorter route between Europe and Asia.\u00a0 Northern routes were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021, proving it was possible. Since then more Russian and Chinese vessels have sailed the northern routes repeatedly.",
      "The alternative way to get goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia is to go south. But that course, through Egypt's Suez Canal, is about 3,000 miles longer.",
      "According to the Arctic Institute, compared to the Suez Canal route, the Northern Sea Route can save shippers as much as 50% in costs, considering fuel and other expenses, by reducing the distance from Japan to Europe, for instance, to only about 10 days compared to the roughly 22 it would take to sail around the southern tip of Africa and then through the Suez Canal.",
      "A 2024 analysis by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies also said the northern route would shave about 10 days of a similar journey from Shanghai, China, to Rotterdam in the Netherlands.",
      "As sea temperatures continue warming and winter ice cover shrinks, shipping traffic via the north is likely to increase, so control over that passage \u2014 and the long Greenlandic coastline that it skirts \u2014 will be of greater importance.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shared graphs in 2022 predicting the new routes that would become available to regular tankers around Greenland over the coming decades.",
      "NOAA's modeling shows a dramatic increase in viable journeys for both polar-class vessels fortified to forge through sea ice, and normal open water-faring ships. The agency even predicts that by 2059, it will likely be possible for a polar-class vessel to sail the most direct route, right across the North Pole, as the formation of sea ice reduces further.",

    "summary": "Many Iranian opposition activists are hoping the current unrest could be the beginning of the end of the country's hardline Islamic regime.",
    "story": [
      "Iran has faced intense nationwide protests for more than\u00a0two weeks, marking the largest challenge to the country's ruling regime in years \u2014 and drawing vows from President Trump to intervene on the protesters' behalf if they face a violent crackdown.",
      "Initially sparked by Iran's economic freefall and severe inflation, the protests have boiled over, with about 185 cities facing demonstrations. One monitoring group has reported thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths since the protests began.",
      "Here's what you need to know:",
      "How the Iran protests started, and what they've become",
      "The current wave of protests began in the capital, Tehran, in late December as shopkeepers went on strike and marched into the streets. Small business owners in Iran have long been seen as supportive of the regime, but anger over spiraling inflation and the devaluation of the nation's currency, which lost more than 40% of its value last year, making everyday goods impossible for many people to afford, sparked the demonstrations.",
      "The protests quickly spread, with people joining marches across the country to denounce not only the economic woes, but to air wider discontent with the country's hardline regime.",
      "As of Saturday, protests were reported in at least 185 cities in all 31 of the country's provinces, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists.",
      "Demonstrations have also been reported on dozens of university campuses since late December, and strikes and shop closures were reported in markets in over a dozen cities, HRANA said.",
      "Videos posted on social media virtually every night have shown crowds of protesters marching through the streets of various Iranian cities, chanting anti-government slogans and clashing with the country's security forces in some cases.",
      "How Iranian authorities have responded",
      "Thousands of people have been reported detained since the wave of protests began,\u00a0according to HRANA. More than 500 people have been killed, the group said Sunday, Jan. 11 \u2014 mostly protesters, but also more than 40 members of the security services.",
      "The group found that many victims \"were killed by live ammunition or pellet gunfire, predominantly from close range.\"",
      "Iran's attorney general on Jan. 10 warned that anyone taking part in the protests would be considered an \"enemy of God,\" according to The Associated Press \u2014 a death-penalty charge.",
      "The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency had\u00a0claimed on Jan. 5\u00a0that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "Iranian authorities cut off phone service and web access beginning Jan. 8\u00a0across the country, according to the internet monitoring organization NetBlocks, which said a \"nationwide internet blackout\" continued into Jan. 11, writing on social media that \"national connectivity levels continue to flatline around 1% of ordinary levels.\"",
      "\"Even Starlink, which has been the main line of communication for some activists in different parts of the country, has been jammed,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent IranWire news site, told CBS News on Friday, referring to the satellite communication system run by Elon Musk.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from SpaceX, which runs Starlink, but did not get any immediate response.",
      "Trump warns he'll hit Iran \"very hard\" if it kills protesters",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened on several occasions since the protests began that he could order a U.S. intervention if Iranian authorities kill demonstrators.",
      "\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!,\" the president wrote on Truth Social on Jan. 10.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Jan. 9, Mr. Trump reiterated that he was open to some kind of U.S. action, although he said that would not involve a U.S. incursion.",
      "\"I've made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts. So, we don't want that to happen.\"",
      "In a Jan. 2 post on Truth Social, he said: \"If Iran [shoots] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Jan. 8, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was \"ready\" to hit Iran hard if protesters were killed, but added, \"for the most part, they haven't\" been.",
      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Jan. 11 that Mr. Trump has been briefed on new options for potential military strikes.",
      "The president's comments came just over six months after he ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, amid a deadly days-long conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "The unrest in Iran also comes as Mr. Trump takes a more aggressive posture on the world stage. U.S. forces captured former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in an overnight military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3, and Mr. Trump has suggested he's open to military action in Colombia to combat drug trafficking, and even to take control of Greenland.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News last week that Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden Iranian protesters, saying his comments may be the \"one ingredient you need to keep \u2026 the street-level movement alive.\"",
      "Bahari, of IranWire, said Iranian officials had told him they were concerned about Mr. Trump potentially intervening in Iran even before the protests began.",
      "The recent U.S. attack on Venezuela, \"has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protesters. But at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause.\"",
      "Iranian leaders acknowledge problems, but blame U.S.",
      "In an address on state television aired Friday, after an intense night of protests, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that his regime would \"not back down,\" called for unity and accused \"a bunch of vandals\" in Tehran of causing chaos in the capital \"to please the U.S. president.\"",
      "In some cases, Iranian officials have attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, acknowledging people's economic concerns and insisting that people have the right to protest peacefully. State media reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian had directed security forces not to crack down on peaceful protesters.",
      "The government has also offered some relief in the form of $7-a-month stipends that can be used in grocery stores to buy basic necessities.",
      "Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned Mr. Trump threats of a U.S. intervention, accusing the U.S. of \"inciting violence and terrorism.\"",
      "Iranian army commander Major General Amir Hatami threatened Wednesday to \"cut off the hand of any aggressor.\"",
      "Iran's history of mass protests",
      "Protests \u2014 and severe crackdowns \u2014 are a recurring theme in Iran.",
      "The last major round of protests came in 2022, spurred by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the theocratic government's forces for allegedly wearing her headscarf incorrectly. Hundreds of people were killed across months of demonstrations.",
      "Other protest movements came in 2019 and 2017, and Iran was beset by a large-scale uprising in 2009 over the country's contested presidential election.",
      "\"From what we saw on social media channels and also from conversations with different people in Iran, the number of protesters in different parts of the country is not as high as in 2022, but there are more protests \u2014   the protests are more widespread in different parts of the country,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"So, even some smaller cities where they never had a protest in those cities, they see protests these days, and I think people are more desperate than before.\"",
      "The current protests seem different compared to the previous rounds \u2014   and could be harder for the regime to quell by offering concessions \u2014 due to their roots in the country's economic woes, according to Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "She noted that in 2022, the regime was able to appease protesters by \"simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth.\"",
      "But the protesters now are more focused on economic problems, and \"there's really nothing [the regime] can do\" to get Iran's moribund economy back on track, she said.",
      "\"These protests, they are about economic situation, but also about dignity,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"It's about the national pride. And because of that, this protest will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi cheers on the protests",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi \u2014 whose father, the former shah, fled just before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power \u2014 has cheered the protests from exile, urging demonstrators this week to keep the movement \"disciplined\" and \"as large as possible.\"",
      "The crown prince called for Iranians to chant together against the country's leadership at 8 p.m. local time, or 12 p.m. Eastern, on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9, and many did seem to answer his call.",
      "\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in a video message on Jan. 9.",

      "\"This is a regime that is not afraid to use lethal force,\" Yacoubian said. \"But the question is, to what extent, if they become overwhelmed, if the protests become overwhelmingly large and if there are elements in security forces, police, and so forth, kind of at that local level, who themselves are suffering the effects of this economic crisis and who decide not to shoot at people: These are the kinds of questions I think that we need to watch.\"",

    "story": [
      "Iran's theocratic rulers are under the most intense pressure they've felt in years, as President Trump leaves the option of a U.S. military intervention on the table in the face of a fast-mounting death toll amid more than two weeks of anti-government protests across the Islamic Republic.",
      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that Iranian officials had called him looking \"to negotiate\" after his repeated threats to intervene if authorities kill protesters. In an unusual move, meanwhile, Iran's state-controlled media aired video on Sunday showing mass casualties in and outside a morgue in a Tehran suburb.",
      "The video shared widely online shows dozens of bodies outside the morgue, which CBS News has geolocated to the southern Tehran suburb of Kahrizak. The bodies were wrapped in black bags, and people can be seen grieving and searching for their loved ones at the site.",
      "The state TV reporter says in the clip that some of those seen dead may have been involved in violence, but that \"the majority of them are ordinary people, and their families are ordinary people as well.\"",
      "Video posted by social media users on Sunday showed scenes from the same morgue, and people could be heard wailing in the background as others appeared to be looking for loved ones amid the bodies.",
      "It is unclear why Iranian authorities might have chosen to show the mass casualties, but it could be an attempt to show sympathy with the protesters and to bolster their narrative that it is more radical actors, inspired by Mr. Trump's messages of support, behind the violence, not the government.",
      "President Trump and Iranian officials have escalated their warnings over the past week, with both sides insisting they're ready for, but not seeking a military confrontation.",
      "On Sunday, however, Mr. Trump said Iran's leadership had called looking to talk.",
      "Trump issues fresh warning, says Iran seeking negotiations",
      "\"The leaders of Iran called\" yesterday, he told reporters Sunday on Air Force One, saying \"a meeting is being set up ... They want to negotiate.\"",
      "\"We may have to act before a meeting,\" Mr. Trump warned. He first warned 10 days ago that if Iran killed protesters, the U.S. would \"come to their rescue,\" but he's yet to say what exactly would prompt some action against the regime, or what that might entail.",
      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Sunday that the president had been briefed on new options for military strikes in Iran, after Mr. Trump warned that if the regime started \"killing people like they have in the past, we would get involved.\"",
      "\"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" he said at the White House. \"And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\"",
      "The U.S. has not yet moved any forces in preparation for potential strikes on Iran, officials with the military's Central Command told CBS News over the weekend.",
      "Iran's top diplomat claims protests \"under total control\"",
      "Iran did not confirm any direct outreach to the Trump administration, but speaking on Monday, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi suggested the regime had brought the protests under control - repeating the government's claim that the U.S. was to blame for the violence.",
      "The \"situation is now under total control,\" Araghchi said, according to the Reuters news agency, as Iranian state TV aired video of massive pro-government demonstrations around the country.",
      "Government-controlled broadcaster IRIB called one demonstration and funeral march an \"Iranian uprising against American-Zionist terrorism.\"",
      "In the face of Mr. Trump's repeated threats, Araghchi said Iran was \"ready for war, but also for dialogue\" with the U.S. at any time.",
      "In another indication that the regime may believe it is weathering the storm, the foreign minister said internet service would be resumed in coordination with Iran's security services, though he offered no specific timeline.",
      "Rights groups say death toll from protests could be in the thousands",
      "According to human rights groups based outside the country, which rely on contacts inside Iran, the death toll has already climbed into the hundreds.",
      "The Washington D.C.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said that, as of Sunday, the 15th day of protests, at least 544 people had been killed, including 483 protesters and 47 members of the security forces. HRANA said the unrest had manifested in 186 cities across all of Iran's 31 provinces.",
      "The Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI), which is also based in the U.S., said over the weekend that it had \"eyewitness accounts and credible reports indicating that hundreds of protesters have been killed across Iran during the current internet shutdown,\" accusing the regime of carrying out \"a massacre.\"",
      "The Iran Human Rights (IHR) organization, based in Norway, said Saturday that it had confirmed at least 192 protesters were killed, but that the number could be over 2,000.",
      "\"Unverified reports indicate that at least several hundreds, and according to some sources, more than 2,000 people may have been killed,\" IHR said in a statement, adding that according to its estimate, more than 2,600 protesters had been arrested.",

      "On social media, Mr. Trump offered his support for the protesters, saying that \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's warnings come as nationwide unrest challenging Iran's theocracy crossed the two-week mark. At least 538 people have died in violence surrounding the demonstrations, U.S.-based activists said, with fears the death toll is far higher. More than 10,600 people have been arrested, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said.",
      "The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. officials, first reported Saturday night that Mr. Trump had been given military options but hadn't made a final decision. The WSJ reports that Trump will receive further options on Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. has not moved any forces in preparation for potential military strikes.",
      "America has many capabilities and options, and cyber attacks could be among them, according to a U.S. official who also confirmed that the Trump administration approves of Elon Musk's decision to make Starlink terminals available in Iran. That satellite-based internet service could help protestors bypass government restrictions amid the ongoing communications blackout. Starlink did not respond to CBS inquiries.",
      "The U.S. already has heavy sanctions on Iran's regime, and in recent weeks has added to them. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that Mr. Trump has \"moral support\" for actions in Iran. He declined to answer a question about whether the U.S. would interdict vessels carrying Iranian oil for trading on the black market.",
      "\"I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back,\" Wright said.",
      "Iran's theocratic rulers continue to claim that the protesters are agitators influenced by the U.S. and Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Saturday about the protests and other regional issues, according to US officials.",
      "Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, Iran's parliament speaker and a hardliner who has run for the presidency in the past, warned Sunday that the U.S. military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if the U.S. strikes the Islamic Republic.",
      "\"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\" Qalibaf said, according to the Associated Press. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\"",
      "On Friday, Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, said on X: \"Our enemies don't know Iran. In the past, the US failed due to their flawed planning. Today too, their flawed scheming will cause them to fail.\"",
      "There are currently 2,000 U.S. troops next door in Iraq, stationed on bases that have previously been targeted by Iranian-backed militias. There are also U.S. forces throughout the Mideast region, including significant hubs in Qatar, home of U.S. Central Command, and Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet is stationed.",

      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said on \"Face the Nation\" that U.S. military action in Iran now to help the protesters would be a \"massive mistake.\"",
      "\"It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up,\" Kaine said. \"Right now, Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country.\"",
      "Kaine called for maintaining the sanctions pressure, noting that it had been successful against the Assad regime in Syria. Last December, armed rebels previously aligned with terror groups finally ousted Assad from power after a 14 year civil war.",
      "\"U.S. military action would bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s and would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States,\" he added.",
      "When asked on Sunday if shooting protesters would be the \"red line\" for Mr. Trump that would trigger U.S. action, a senior U.S. official declined to explicitly confirm it, saying \"only Trump can determine what the red line is.\"",

    "summary": "As activists say Iran's anti-government unrest has seen at least 538 people killed, the nation's rulers threaten protesters and U.S. forces across the Mideast.",
    "story": [
      "Dubai, United Arab Emirates\u00a0\u2014 Nationwide unrest challenging Iran's theocracy saw protesters flood the streets in the country's capital and its second-largest city Saturday night and into Sunday morning, crossing the two-week mark. The death toll of people who have died in violence surrounding the demonstrations jumped to at least 538 people, U.S.-based activists said.",
      "With the internet down in Iran and phone lines cut off, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult. But according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which relies on a network of contacts inside the country, the death toll from clashes between protesters and Iran's security forces has climbed steadily.",
      "Of those killed, 490 are protesters and 48 are members of the security forces, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said, warning the toll is likely to go up. Another 10,600 people have been detained over the two weeks of protests, the group said. \u00a0The Iranian government has not offered any overall casualty figures for the demonstrations.",
      "Faced with its most significant challenge in years, Iran's theocratic rulers have issued increasingly stern threats to what it claims are agitators being influenced by the U.S. and Israel \u2014 and answered threats of a U.S. intervention by President Trump with corresponding threats of their own.",
      "Iran's parliament speaker warned the U.S. military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if America strikes the Islamic Republic, as threatened by Mr. Trump. Qalibaf made the threat as lawmakers rushed the dais in the Iranian parliament, shouting: \"Death to America!\"",
      "Those abroad fear the information blackout will embolden hard-liners within Iran's security services to launch a bloody crackdown, despite warnings from Mr. Trump that he's willing to strike the Islamic Republic if demonstrators are killed.",
      "On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\"",
      "\"I'm sure that has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protestors, but at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause,\" Maziar Bahari, the editor of the IranWire news website told CBS News.",
      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump has been briefed on new options for potential military strikes in Iran. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. officials, reported Saturday night that Mr. Trump had been given military options but hadn't made a final decision.",
      "Iran lawmaker says \"signs of a threat\" could trigger attacks on U.S. troops",
      "Iranian state television broadcast the Sunday parliament session live. Qalibaf, a hard-liner who has run for the presidency in the past, gave a speech applauding police and Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, particularly its all-volunteer Basij, for having \"stood firm\" during the protests.",
      "\"The people of Iran should know that we will deal with them in the most severe way and punish those who are arrested,\" Qalibaf said.",
      "He went on to directly threaten Israel, \"the occupied territory\" as he referred to it, and the U.S. military, possibly with a preemptive strike.",
      "\"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\" Qalibaf said. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\"",
      "It remains unclear just how serious Iran is about launching a strike, particularly after seeing its air defenses destroyed during the 12-day war in June with Israel, which also saw the U.S. carry out strikes against its nuclear facilities. Any decision to go to war would rest with Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "The U.S. military has said in the Mideast it is \"postured with forces that span the full range of combat capability to defend our forces, our partners and allies and U.S. interests.\"",
      "Israel, meanwhile, is \"watching closely\" the situation between the U.S. and Iran, said an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to not being authorized to speak to journalists. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio overnight on topics including Iran, the official added.",
      "Iran targeted U.S. forces at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar back in June, while the U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet is stationed in the island kingdom of Bahrain.",
      "Iran threatens protesters with death sentences",
      "Online videos sent out of Iran, likely using Starlink satellite transmitters, purportedly showed gathering in northern Tehran's Punak neighborhood. There, it appeared authorities shut off streets, with protesters waving their lit mobile phones. Others banged metal while fireworks went off.",
      "Other video purportedly showed demonstrators peacefully marching down a street and others honking their car horns on the street.",
      "\"The pattern of protests in the capital has largely taken the form of scattered, short-lived, and fluid gatherings, an approach shaped in response to the heavy presence of security forces and increased field pressure,\" the Human Rights Activists News Agency said. \"At the same time, reports were received of surveillance drones flying overhead and movements by security forces around protest locations, indicating ongoing monitoring and security control.\"",
      "In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, some 450 miles northeast of Tehran, video purported to show protesters confronting security forces. Flaming debris and dumpsters could be seen in the street, blocking the road. Mashhad is home to the Imam Reza shrine, the holiest in Shiite Islam, making the protests there carry heavy significance for the country's theocracy.",
      "Protests also appeared to happen in Kerman, 500 miles southeast of Tehran.",
      "Iranian state television on Sunday morning took a page from demonstrators, having their correspondents appear on streets in several cities to show calm areas with a date stamp shown on screen. Tehran and Mashhad were not included. They also showed pro-government demonstrations in Qom and Qazvin.",
      "Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite U.S. warnings. Tehran escalated its threats Saturday, with Iran's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an \"enemy of God,\" a death-penalty charge. The statement carried by Iranian state television said even those who \"helped rioters\" would face the charge.",
      "Iran's theocracy cut off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls on Thursday, though it allowed some state-owned and semiofficial media to publish. Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera news network reported live from Iran, but they appeared to be the only major foreign outlet able to work.",
      "Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who called for protests Thursday and Friday, asked in his latest message for demonstrators to take to the streets Saturday and Sunday. He urged protesters to carry Iran's old lion-and-sun flag and other national symbols used during the time of the shah to \"claim public spaces as your own.\"",
      "Pahlavi's support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past \u2014 particularly after the 12-day war. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some protests, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "The demonstrations began Dec. 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country's economy is squeezed by international sanctions in part levied over its nuclear program. The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran's theocracy.",
      "Pope Leo calls for dialogue",
      "Pope Leo XIV offered prayers for those killed in protests in Iran and in the conflict in Syria and called for dialogue and peace on Sunday.",
      "\"My thoughts turn to what is happening these days in the Middle East, particularly in Iran and Syria, where persistent tensions are causing the deaths of many people,\" the U.S.-born pontiff said during his weekly Angelus prayer at the Vatican. \"I hope and pray for the patient cultivation of dialogue and peace, for the common good of society as a whole.\"",

    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials are set to meet with Danish officials about Greenland on Wednesday, diplomatic sources tell CBS News.",
      "The meeting, which has not been officially announced, comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress last week that President Trump is interested in purchasing the Danish territory. The White House also said Tuesday officials are discussing a wide range of options\u00a0for acquiring Greenland, including using the U.S. military to take it by force.",
      "While Rubio had downplayed the threat of military force in his remarks to reporters, Mr. Trump doubled down on the possibility again on Sunday night, saying, \"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland, and I am not going to let that happen.\"",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday aboard Air Force One, echoing his previous statement on Friday when he said, \"if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, who met with Danish officials last week, said on Sunday that he thinks Democrats and Republicans in Congress would unite to stop any military action aimed at taking Greenland. \"We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way,\" he said on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"Either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy,\" the Democrat said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0told the New York Times\u00a0in an interview published last week that ownership of Greenland, the world's largest island, was important because \"that's what I feel is psychologically needed for success.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he feels the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland for defense purposes.",
      "The escalatory language by the president in recent weeks has further stressed already strained relations with European allies. Multiple European diplomats told CBS News that they increasingly understand that America's commitment to the defense of Europe and NATO is no longer as ironclad as it has been over the past decades \u2014 or even the past few years of\u00a0the war in Ukraine, during which the U.S. rallied European countries to unify against Russian aggression. One diplomat told CBS News that the Greenland situation is a potential breaking point.",
      "When asked Sunday whether he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the NATO alliance, Mr. Trump said, \"It would save a lot of money. I like NATO. I just wonder whether or not, if we needed NATO, would they be there for us. I'm not sure they would.\"",
      "Louisiana GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, who Mr. Trump appointed as\u00a0special envoy to Greenland\u00a0last month, wrote Sunday on X that \"History matters. The U.S. defended Greenland's sovereignty during WWII when Denmark couldn't.\"",
      "\"After the war, Denmark re-occupied it\u2014side stepping and ignoring UN protocol. This should be about hospitality, not hostility,\" Landry said.",
      "In response, Denmark's Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen said \"facts matter too,\" and pointed out Greenland \"has been a part of the Kingdom of Denmark for centuries.\" He also emphasized that last week, all five of Greenland's parties in Parliament repeated they\u00a0don't want to become part of the U.S.",
      "\"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u00a0said earlier this month that an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Denmark is a NATO member, and NATO's Article 5 states that if a NATO ally suffers an armed attack, all members will consider it an attack on them as well and do what they need to aid the attacked nation.",
      "\"This would be disastrous,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" It wouldn't just be the end of NATO, it would be America alone.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, Republican of Florida, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Republican congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar, who joins us this morning from Miami. Congresswoman, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "REP. MAR\u00cdA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Thank you for the opportunity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are one of Maria Corina Machado's top allies in Congress. You've said she is coming to Washington this week. President Trump said maybe Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. Details still being worked out. Why is it important for her to get in front of the President of the United States, who is backing Maduro's number two as the current president of that country?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Okay, well, I don't think that the President is really backing anyone that is related to the Maduro regime. But concentrating on Maria Corina Machado, she earned it. She was the one who put together this- she proved to the international community that they, the opposition forces, had won the election. She was able to somehow create the tallies and prove to the Trump administration that they had won by 70 to 30. Remember that Maduro did not give her the opportunity to be the Presidential nominee because he did not like her, because he knew that he was going to lose against her. So she has earned it, and I am sure that she will have a very good, long, solid conversation with the President. She knows the story better than anybody. I was in touch with her during the 16 months that she was hiding in a tunnel because the Maduro forces were looking for her to kill her. So, she's earned it. So, I think we are going to welcome her in Congress, and I'm sure that President Trump is going to be highly, highly pleased with that meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the Energy Secretary here say it could be- it could be years before we get to a transition. The President did say democracy is something he hopes for in Venezuela. Does that mean that she should go back, that the United States should guarantee Maria Corina Machado's security to return? I mean, how can the opposition go back for an election right now?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, you know, she was planning to go when we met in Oslo, when she received the Nobel Peace Prize, she was saying to everybody that she was ready to go back, when on January 3, we took Maduro out. They- I love what Secretary Rubio is expressing and the plan that we have as the country of stabilize, recover, and transition. I think that if you think about it, the Trump administration is creating a blueprint, a new ground breaking, new model for foreign policy, when he- vis-a-vis the western hemisphere. So Maria Corina and the opposition forces fall in that three-planned layout that we have, that Rubio has created and Trump has blessed. So she is part of the transition, and I am sure that they will be able to reorganize themselves. She has hundreds of thousands of people in Caracas and in Venezuela that will help us to put together this electoral system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know that you support the Trump administration's policy, but Secretary of State Rubio really, really bristled when I asked him why they didn't arrest the Minister of the Interior, Diosdado Cabello, who remains in power. You have been very, very clear in your statements that you think the United States should arrest him. We went back and looked, CBS Miami's Jim DeFede reported in 2017 that Caballo had tried to assassinate Senator Rubio. Can you help people understand why perhaps people in Florida should be concerned or other Americans about this man remaining in control of security forces?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, you know, I know that just Diosdado is probably worse than Maduro and worse than Delcy. They're all Alibaba and the 40 Thieves. Let's- don't make any- let's make sure, for your international audience, that- but- but I am very reassured the fact that we have taken the oil and the resources away from them. That Diosdado Cabello, who is a thief, I repeat, does not want to fall into where Maduro has fallen into, and they will cooperate. And somehow, because we have created this new type of model, that they will work with us, they do not have their resources now they know that we're going to go into this recovery, and that- and that somehow they are going to definitely participate and work with the American forces. They know better. And like I said, this is impressive what's happening, because we have not seen this before in 250 years of history. And Diosdado, I repeat, is definitely someone who was indicted. And one of the source- I have some sources that say that, that we were not able to locate him, but it did- at this hour, I would say that, that everything is really falling into place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he controls the prisons, and there are at least five Americans in those prisons--",
      "REP. SALAZAR: -- With Delcy. With Delcy. Delcy is the one who is really in charge of the secret police and the repressive apparatus. And Diosdado Cabello was in charge of the military, who was part of the Sun's cartel along with Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you know why the Trump administration isn't publicly demanding the release of the Americans that are being held?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Listen, maybe- maybe we do not know some things that are happening, and Rubio said it the other day. I do understand, and I am sure, Rubio knows the area very well, and he knows who the characters are. And we are definitely taking this with- with solid in- a solid- with solid steps. We do not want to make any mistakes and- and I am sure that the political prisoners will be coming out and that we- that we're not giving them, meaning Diosdado and Delcy, any type of- of leeway for them to really run the country. We will see. Like it happened- it happened two, three weeks ago. Let's give them a little bit more time before we see more results.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, the President tweeted today, Cuba gets no more money, no more oil. The CIA assessment is that that regime in Havana is not necessarily in peril, even though the President's saying they are. What are you hearing?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, look, I represent the city of Miami, you know, the heart of the Cuban exile community. And those words are like, magical. It's been 65 years. You know, Cuba is- is really a center of power for our enemies, Iran, Russia, China. And- and now I think they are- they are getting the memo. And Cuba, it's- it's hanging by your threat, by a thread I should say. The threat that Cuba has represented to the United States has been immense. They have no water, they have no electricity, they have no food. They have nothing. So if you think that Maduro was weak. Cuba is even weaker, and now they do not have one drop of oil coming from Venezuela. So that could be the beginning of the end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Mexico is stepping up and providing them some. We're going to have to watch--",
      "REP. SALAZAR: -- And that is a very big mistake. A very big mistake from Madame Sheibaum--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- what happens next. \u00a0 All right. Thank you very much, Congresswoman. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Richmond, Virginia, where we find Senator Tim Kaine, who has oversight in foreign relations and other key committees. Senator, we know the president has been briefed on military options, but our reporting is no decision made, no military assets put in place to execute anything yet. There aren't even any aircraft carriers in the Mideast region at this moment in time, would you support military action?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, U.S. military action in Iran would be a massive mistake. It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up. Right now, Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country. This Iranian regime has spent years focusing outside its borders on fomenting terrorism and aggression in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza, instead of listening to the needs of its own citizens, and much like Syrian citizens, finally threw off the yoke of Bashar al-Assad and that brutal regime without U.S. military intervention, it looks to be that Iran is doing the same. So let's celebrate their freedom loving spirit. Let's keep up the sanctions pressure, which helped in Syria and is helping, I think, dramatize the- the misdeeds of this regime. But U.S. military action would just bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s and would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Syria there. There was some, you know, covert U.S. support. There was something in the beginning, at least with that kind of uprising, would you support any kind of help? I mean, the president saying we're going to help the protesters. What does that mean? Or what should it look like?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, I think again, let's use sanctions. In Syria, the Caesar sanctions that we put in place in 2019 to punish Bashar al-Assad for war crimes had a real effect on the Syrian energy, construction and other sectors. And when Syria chose to go a new path, President Trump, with the support of a bipartisan Congress, has reduced those sanctions to open up a new chapter in life for Syria. That's the right answer, but military action, we did not take military action against Bashar al-Assad. We have been engaged militarily in Syria to fight ISIS, because ISIS was part of al-Qaeda, there's a Military Authorization for Use of U.S. Force against ISIS. We've worked with other nations to reduce them, but we didn't use military action against Bashar al-Assad. And we shouldn't use military action against the Iranian government in this- in this protest moment, let's support these brave freedom fighters in other ways, through sanctions, but not use our sons and daughters in the military to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just very quickly, when you mentioned there was authorization for force in Syria and ISIS, I assume that means you support the military strikes that took place yesterday against 35 targets in Syria. This was in response to the killing of those two U.S. soldiers and an American interpreter. That's valid, in your view?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Yeah, yeah, it is legally valid that it has long been held that the 2001 congressional authorization against al-Qaeda includes the ability to go against groups that have come out of or have affiliated with al-Qaeda that mean harm to the U.S. troops. And in this instance, ISIS is still a threat to U.S. troops. There is a legal authorization for the U.S. of force, which is what makes this so different than the use of the military force against Venezuela or Greenland or Cuba or wherever the president wants to take us to war next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're taking me to the next topic, which is this effort you led. You got about five Republican senators to join your effort in this procedural vote to restrict the president's actions, he would require new congressional approval before new military action in Venezuela. Do you think the Republicans who were with you on this vote will stay with you, given that the president has openly threatened them?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, I think they will, and I think more may join. The five republicans who voted with me, let's be clear what they were voting for. The Trump administration has waged war, first against Venezuelan boats in international waters, then covert action in Venezuela, and now an attack on Venezuela to depose its leadership, to establish a new government that we chose, not that the Venezuelan people chose, to seize Venezuela's economy and even say we're going to set the terms of economic and political transition for the next few years. What my Republican colleagues voted for is, let's get this out of the classified and put it before the American public and actually debate this use of the U.S. military on the floor of the United States Senate. Four months into it, hundreds of Venezuelans dead, American troops injured, let's finally debate this publicly. That's all they voted for, and the fact that the president is going against them just for wanting to have this debate before the public, shows how nervous the president is about both his legal authority, but also the wisdom of what he's doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, he said publicly they should not be re-elected because they- they issued this, this call for congressional review. You brought up Greenland. This is the- the territory that Denmark has broad governance over, Denmark being a NATO ally. World leaders take President Trump's remarks seriously. We take him seriously and literally. And to that point, Denmark's Prime Minister publicly warned that it would mean the end of the NATO alliance if he carries out what he said. Which as recently as Friday, he said, I want to make a deal for Greenland the easy way, but if we don't do it the easy way, we are going to do it the hard way. Is there anything to stop the president from doing it quote, unquote, \"the hard way,\" which sounds like military force?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, I think Congress will stop them, both Democrats and Republicans. This would be disastrous. It wouldn't just be \"America First.\" It wouldn't just be the end of NATO, it would be America alone. If we take our best allies, and Denmark has been an ally for a very long time, and we decide that we have the military ability to seize territory for them, you will see the United States, instead of being the world's chief diplomat and a leader in the world, you'll see the United States isolated as a pariah. And I've talked to my Republican colleagues, they- they watch what the president has done is Venezue- in Venezuela. They hear the threats against other nations. I can tell you this, we will force a vote in the Senate about no U.S. military action in Greenland or Denmark. If we need to, we will get overwhelming bipartisan support that this president is foolish to even suggest this. We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way, either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for action in Congress on that front. Senator Kaine, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, President Trump vowed that Venezuela now has the military protection of the US. This comes just one week after he said the US would run that country. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is expected to travel to Washington to meet with President Trump this week. For his part, Mr. Trump and his team met with dozens of US oil executives late last week, urging them to commit $100 billion to boost oil production there. Joining us now to discuss it all is the United States Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, good to have you here in person.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I ask you about Venezuela, very quickly, these protests in Iran, not this country reliant on oil to keep its government controlled economy afloat. The President has been briefed on military options. What is the US willing to do to help?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Certainly the President has been very outspoken about wanting to have freedom and rule of law and capitalism and great relations with the United States return. So we'll see. I think his moral support has been strong. Certainly, he's taken a strong stance against the mullahs in Iran in disabling their nuclear program. I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back. I won't go into the specifics there, but we wish them well, and we'd love to see a free and democratic Iran again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will there be more interdictions of vessels carrying Iranian oil? Any more activity on that front?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I won't reveal any change in position there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, let me ask you about Venezuela,",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: where you have been very focused and very central to the President's policy. The President said that Venezuela now has the United States, the most powerful military in the world, to protect them. To protect them, we will.\u00a0 Is the United States military providing security guarantees for American companies?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We're not doing that right now, but what we, what he means, is we're changing the game for what's happening in the ground in Venezuela. Venezuela has purchased $20 billion of Russian weapons. They got Cuban mercenaries there. They supply oil to Cuba. They, they harbor the Hezbollah's headquarters for the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela has been a very dangerous, very destabilized place going down the tubes. And with the United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think we're going to, we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela. This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's off to a quick start. You had the oil executives at the White House just Friday. That the President, excuse me, the State Department yesterday had a security alert I want to ask you about because it specifically cited the risk to Americans in Venezuela, and it said armed militias are setting up roadblocks, searching vehicles for evidence of US citizenship or support for the US. The man who runs those militias is Diosdado Cabello, who is the Minister of the Interior. Is he ordering the hunting of Americans?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Not that we are aware of, but we should be cautious. Look, this is, as they say, eight days into a change into a change of leadership there. The interim authorities are trying to establish power. Collectivos have been running wild over, over Venezuela for, for over a decade. So, yeah, you're not going to\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well he controls them.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: He does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is he safe in his position? Because right now the administration seems to be working with him.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the mean term is a collapse of the nation. And I think the strong moves we're making right now is to influence the people with the guns today, which is part of a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're not concerned he's going to undermine the more business minded President Delcy Rodriguez?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Oh, of course we're worried about things like that. We need to get stability among the leadership in Venezuela. So yes, of course we're concerned about those things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me broadly, is the Trump administration's goal here to acquire the state oil company, PDVSA, and to run it. Are you going to put Americans on the board? How is this going to work?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, again, it's a process. The first thing to do is to reduce the damage to the United States, the inflow of guns and criminals and immigrants and drugs into the United States, the destabilizing of a key part of the Western Hemisphere. We need to stop that. That's why we've entered into Venezuela. Certainly, part of the way to improve Venezuela and to improve the Western Hemisphere and improve the lives of Americans is to get their very corrupt 25 years in decline, oil industry back going again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean the United States government is going to run it? The president says we're going to run the country. Are we running this as like as an American state owned oil company essentially?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: No. Today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers, and then that crude goes out into the market. We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans. But in the long run, what will happen with Venezuelan oil resources? Yeah, of course, quite likely you'll see American companies' expanded presence there. You'll see growing production. Of course, you're going to see more American involvement in there. But exactly how that's going to work, that's going to unfold over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So back in November, us, Judge backed a bid by an American hedge fund to purchase Citgo Petroleum. The Treasury still has to approve that deal. The hedge fund is actually run by a big Trump donor, Paul Singer. Do you want to preserve Venezuelan ownership of Citgo? Do you want to have America have a financial stake in it, like Trump bought a big portion of an intel company, do you want to own portions of oil companies?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Again, that's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility. The Citgo sale is part of, is part of bringing redress to creditors of the United States for the Venezuelan Government. And of course, one, one of the capital providers in that transaction is a hedge fund provider you just mentioned. There's lots of American investors and American refining entrepreneurs that are involved in that so to take Venezuelan owned refineries that are in the United States and legally through an auction process, transfer them to American owners and American entrepreneurs in the refining business. I think that's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about corruption here, though. Will there be Americans installed on these boards? And how do you respond to these allegations that some Trump donors are going to get preferential treatment?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I can assure you that is absolutely not the case. Absolutely not the case. Think of what President Trump has done for the American oil and gas industry. He's driven down the price of oil. He's dramatically reduced\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's an over supply of oil. And now you're going to put more on the market.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. That's not- That's not good for American oil and gas companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it makes it less profitable for them to actually go and invest in drill, baby, drill.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. Democrats and President Biden are fantastic for American oil and gas companies because they try to restrict the supply to something that's essential to life, which only has one possible impact, which is to drive up prices and grow profitability. So President Trump is no, is no helper to the oil and gas industry. And certainly there's no corruption, preferential placement of people. There's none of that. I can assure you of that. I'm in the center of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to decide the contracts? Is the Treasury going to approve the Citgo dominance there in that\u2013",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: That went through a large auction to buy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Are you going to brief to Congress the decisions you're making about which firms get access?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Absolutely. All that was an auction open to all American firms. There were many bidders, including the coalition of bidders you mentioned. We want those assets to get as much money as possible, to go back to the creditors of the Venezuelan Government. And we want American refinery assets owned by Americans that are going to increase the throughput, drive down the price of gasoline in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So Secretary Rubio said there's a three point plan, stabilize, rehabilitate, transition. This sounds indefinite, even when you heard some of those oil executives, Chevron's leadership, they're already in Venezuela, we should say, said it will take 18 to 24 months to even increase oil production by 50%. So how long is this American involvement? Because he's saying there, it's at least a year and a half, two years.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: They've been there for 100 years, and likely, Chevron's going to be there 50 years from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States government, how long does that role continue?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: You heard the third part of Rubio's question, which is transition. We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela. We don't have a legitimate government of Venezuela today. We'd like to move and get there, but America\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a timeline?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT:\u00a0 25 years, this country has gone in decline. President Trump out of the box, creative intervention has allowed us to change the game. But, yeah, I don't know the timeline of that. It's not weeks, it's more months. Could be a year or two could be more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Secretary Wright, thank you for your time today.",

      "Though Mandel's entertainment career spans more than four decades, the 70-year-old comedian has previously revealed that much of his wealth comes from diversified investments, particularly real estate. The \"America's Got Talent\" judge has long used his platform to advocate for financial literacy and smart money habits.",

      "\"I love that book, \u2018Rich Dad, Poor Dad,'\" Mandel continued, referring to Robert T. Kiyosaki's 1997 personal finance bestseller. \"I had this theory before I read the book, but anytime you get a dollar, then you've got an employee if you can make your dollar work for you.\"",
      "\"So, instead of spending it or buying something that could get you into debt or something that's going to diminish in value, if you can get something, like, if you're gonna buy a house, then buy a duplex and rent out the other ones, so the mortgage is free.\"",

      "\"I think fourth grade math is all one needs,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Any dollar you make, you should look at that dollar and say, \u2018How can this dollar make me a nickel?\u2019 You know, or \u2018How can this dollar make any money?\u2019 And every dollar can make you money.\"",
      "\"You could find ways to make money,\" Mandel continued. \"It's easier to spend money, but then you're just assuming that more is coming in.\"",

Contestants can submit a video audition through the show's official casting website or line up for hours to audition for producers during open calls that are held in select U.S. cities.",

      "\"A comedian sending a tape is not always the best quality because you're at the mercy of whoever's taping or what the club has or their sound system or their lights or whatever,\" he said. \"Or they come in in-person, and then they have to kind of show their wares in front of a table of producers with no audience.\"",
      "\"And I am such a proponent of stand-up comedy and feel that it's under \u2014 people don't know what goes into it \u2014 especially on our show,\" Mandel continued. \"When you see somebody come out, and they're hanging upside down, two stories in the air and in flames, or even if you just come out, and you're a singer, and you are singing a cover song. And you know, you're singing somebody else's song, and you play guitar and the audience just needs to sit there and then at the end, if you hit a really high note, or you get loud, they roar, and they stand at the end.\"",

      "\"But a comedian has to write their own material,\" he pointed out. \"They have to present it themselves and there are no bells and whistles unless those are your props. So, I feel that for the producers, to get the best idea of what somebody can deliver, why don't you see it in the place where it is supposed to be? And that is in front of a real audience.\"",
      "\"And hopefully\u2026if they do something great, you bring them to the show, and they can replicate that on TV. And I just think that no other form of entertainment needs that kind of audition or space or stage to really show people.\"",

You know, in the circus, the clown goes on last. Even on \u2018The Tonight Show,\u2019 they put the comedian on at the end\u2026or it's the opening act.\"",
      "\"I don't think there's a lot of respect for funny or silly or whatever, but as somebody who's in the throes of it, a lot goes into it, and it can be terrifying,\" Mandel continued. \"It can be arduous. It's a lot of work.\"",

      "Oregon election officials are set to begin removing hundreds of thousands of inactive voters from the state\u2019s registration rolls, a move that comes after years of inaction, mounting public pressure, and lawsuits filed against the state in recent months.",
      "Oregon's Democratic Secretary of State Tobias Read, in a\u00a0press release Friday, outlined two new directives he said will \"restart\" the \"routine cleanup of outdated, inactive voter registration records\" in accordance with state law to address the roughly 800,000 inactive voter records that are being maintained by election officials.",
      "The first directive orders counties to immediately cancel long-inactive voter registrations that already met the legal requirements for removal before 2017. These are registrations where election mail was returned as undeliverable, voters failed to respond to official notices, and they did not participate in multiple federal elections. State officials estimate roughly 160,000 registrations fall into this category and should have been removed years ago.",
      "The second directive changes how the state handles inactive voters going forward. It updates the language on voter confirmation cards to clearly warn voters that their registrations will be canceled if they do not respond or vote within the required time frame. State officials say this step restores a process that allows routine cleanup of inactive registrations under federal law.",

      "Together, the directives are designed to address a backlog of inactive records and restart regular voter-roll maintenance after Oregon paused removals in 2017.",
      "\"These directives are about cleaning up old data that\u2019s no longer in use so Oregonians can be confident that our voter records are up-to-date,\" Read said. \"From day one, our goal was clear: run elections that are secure, fair, and accurate. This move will strengthen our voter rolls and reinforce public trust in our elections.\"",
      "State officials acknowledge there are about 800,000 inactive registrations total, roughly 20% of Oregon\u2019s voter rolls, though they stress multiple times in the press release that inactive voters do not currently receive ballots, saying at one point, \"again, none of the individuals associated with these records will receive ballots, and these inactive records have no impact on Oregon elections.\"",
      "Being marked \"inactive\" in Oregon means you\u2019re still listed as a registered voter, but you aren\u2019t receiving ballot mail from the state until you reactivate your registration.",

      "Oregon State Capitol Building (Getty Images)",
      "However, inactive voters are still counted in the official voter roll totals, included in public records, and many experts have made the case that accurate rolls should reflect real, current voters, not people who moved years ago or can\u2019t be located. Leaving outdated records in place increases the risk of mistakes, an expert on the subject told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"First of all, it's astounding that they haven't been removing anybody from the voter force in almost a decade because this is very basic 101 level election administration,\" said Jason Snead, executive director of the Honest Elections Project.",
      "Snead explained that voter rolls naturally change every year as people move, die, lose eligibility due to felony convictions, or leave the state, creating constant churn that must be managed. When states fail to keep up, Snead says, voter rolls become bloated and outdated, making elections harder to administer and increasing the risk of errors and abuse.",
      "Snead emphasized that the problem is especially serious in mail-in voting states like Oregon. He argues that automatically mailing ballots while failing to routinely clean voter rolls makes it more likely that ballots will be sent to people who are no longer eligible, including those who have moved or died. Even if state officials say inactive voters don\u2019t receive ballots, Snead says Oregon\u2019s recent administrative failures, including the suspension of its automatic voter registration program in 2024 after non-citizens were mistakenly registered, justify skepticism about whether safeguards are consistently working as claimed.",

      "An election worker tabulating a ballot. (Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"I think there's clearly a degree of skepticism that's warranted, and I think that it really speaks to the need to always be focused on the basics of election administration,\" Snead said. \"Cleaning of the vote rolls is really one of the most foundational, important things that a secretary of state should be doing.\"",
      "Oregon has been slapped with several lawsuits in recent months related to its handling of voter rolls, from Judicial Watch, Public Interest Legal Foundation, as well as Trump\u2019s Department of Justice, and Snead suspects the timing of the Secretary of State\u2019s announcement is \"probably to some degree\" related to that.",
      "\"There's an almost pathological resistance on the left to cleaning up the voter rolls, they call it voter purge, and they say that this is going to disenfranchise voters,\" Snead said. \"We've heard of all of the various statements. You know, lots of different ways and lots of different examples. But then when you actually bring litigation over this, sometimes that forces their hand.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital after publication, an Oregon SOS spokesperson said, \"We can\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\u00a0 I can say that getting this done was a priority for Secretary Read before he even took office, and he took this step because it\u2019s the right thing to do. He wants his office focused on the details. \u00a0We know this won\u2019t satisfy those bad actors trying to undermine our free, fair, secure American elections, but the average Oregon voter can rest assured we are doing the hard work of running accurate and transparent elections.\"",
      "\"Furthermore, the DOJ lawsuit is not related \u2013 it\u2019s about whether we have to hand over Oregonians\u2019 private voter data. Which we have no intent of doing.\"",
      "Cleaning up voter rolls has become an increasingly politicized issue in recent years, with Republicans pushing for more oversight in the name of election integrity and Democrats accusing Republicans of attempting to \"disenfranchise\" voters.",
      "\"Democrats support normal list maintenance and reasonable efforts to keep voter rolls up to date and in compliance with federal law,\" DNC Spokesperson Albert Fujii told Fox News Digital. \"The contrast could not be clearer: Donald Trump and the Republican Party are pushing aggressive voter purges to systematically disenfranchise eligible voters across the country, especially voters of color.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, RNC National Press Secretary Kiersten Pels said, \"Oregon's Democrat Secretary of State has presided over one of the most bloated voter rolls in the country, with more than 800,000 inactive registrations.\"",
      "\"Democratic states have allowed their voter rolls to spiral out of control, especially in mail-in voting systems like Oregon\u2019s. The RNC is taking action nationwide to ensure states are cleaning their voter rolls as required by law.\"",

      "However, their attitudes about lethal force after a U.S. Capitol police officer killed Ashli Babbitt paint a very different picture of these Democrats' views on police using lethal force.",
      "As recently as this year, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who have rebuked Trump administration arguments that shootings involving federal immigration officials last week were justified, also rebuked a multimillion-dollar settlement awarded to the family of Ashli Babbitt earlier this year, calling it a \"slap in the face\" and a \"sickening message to police.\" Babbitt was shot and killed by a U.S. Capitol Police officer during the Jan. 6 riot as she was pushing and beating against a door that led into the Speaker's Lobby just outside the House chamber along with a mob of others.",

      "Rep. Primal Jayapal, D-Wash., who has claimed to have been very close to Babbitt when the Speaker's Lobby was trying to be breached, has chastised Republicans who she believes have failed to adequately honor U.S. Capitol Police for their work on Jan. 6, 2021. \"They were begging for protection from Capitol Police. Yet they refused to honor Capitol Police there[after], refused to accept that it was real,\" Jayapal told Teen Vogue in 2022.",

      "Reps. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Jason Crow, D-Colo., were also among those Democrats praising Capitol Police for their actions on Jan. 6, 2021 last week, while condemning the federal officer involved in the shooting that occurred as well. Crow complained that a plaque honoring U.S. Capitol Police officers who protected people on Jan. 6 was not hung up because of GOP obstruction, but was unafraid to condemn federal officials for \"kill[ing]\" someone. Raskin, who has also condemned the multimillion-dollar settlement to the Babbitt family, said he was \"sickened\" at ICE agents for \"killing\" a woman in Minneapolis.",
      "Raskin's colleague from Oregon, Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., demanded on X last week that federal immigration officers be held accountable for their involvement in the Portland shooting. She referred to the illegal immigrant gang members shot as \"victims,\" even though they tried to ram their car into officers. However, after the Capitol riot in 2021, Bonamici regularly praised the \"heroism\" of the U.S. Capitol Police and suggested they should be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.",
      "Rick Wilson, co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, sought to explain the discrepancy between Democrats' reaction to Babbitt's shooting versus the ICE shootings in a post on X, arguing \"Babbitt was a domestic terrorist,\" and the victim killed in Minneapolis, Renee Good, \"was a mom, murdered by ICE.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Raskin echoed Wilson's sentiment, arguing two different investigations found the Babbitt shooting was \"entirely reasonable and appropriate.\" He added that anyone taking the position that Good was treated properly would also have to agree that hundreds of protesters on Jan. 6, 2021 \"could have been legitimately shot in the face three times.\"",

      "Sensory nerves in your skin send a rapid signal to your spinal cord, which triggers your muscles right away. Your brain catches up later. Most robots cannot do this. When a humanoid robot touches something harmful, sensor data usually travels to a central processor, waits for analysis and then sends instructions back to the motors.

      "A humanoid robot equipped with neuromorphic e-skin reacts instantly to harmful touch, mimicking the human nervous system to prevent damage and improve safety. (Eduardo Parra/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "How the neuromorphic e-skin works",
      "The e-skin is built in four layers that mirror how human skin and nerves function. The top layer acts as a protective outer covering, similar to the epidermis. Beneath it sit sensors and circuits that behave like sensory nerves. Even when nothing touches the robot, the skin sends a small electrical pulse to the robot every 75 to 150 seconds. This signal acts like a status check that says everything is fine. When the skin is damaged, that pulse stops. The robot immediately knows where it was injured and alerts its owner. Touch creates another signal. Normal contact sends neural-like spikes to the robot's central processor for interpretation. However, extreme pressure triggers something different.",
      "How robots detect pain and trigger instant reflexes",
      "If force exceeds a preset threshold, the skin generates a high-voltage spike that goes straight to the motors. This bypasses the central processor entirely. The result is a reflex. The robot can pull its arm away instantly, much like a human does after touching a hot surface. The pain signal only appears when the contact is truly dangerous, which helps prevent overreaction. This local reflex system reduces damage, improves safety and makes interactions feel more natural.",

      "Scientists developed a robotic skin that can detect pain and trigger reflexes without waiting for a central processor to respond. (Han Suyuan/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)",
      "Self-repairing robotic skin makes fixes fast",
      "The design includes another clever feature. The e-skin is made from magnetic patches that fit together like building blocks. If part of the skin gets damaged, an owner can remove the affected patch and snap in a new one within seconds. There is no need to replace the entire surface. That modular approach saves time, lowers costs and keeps robots in service longer.",
      "Why pain-sensing skin matters for real-world robots",
      "Future service robots will need to work close to people. They will assist patients, help older adults and operate safely in crowded spaces. A sense of touch that includes pain and injury detection makes robots more aware and more trustworthy. It also reduces the risk of accidents caused by delayed reactions or sensor overload. The research team says their neural-inspired design improves robotic touch, safety and intuitive human-robot interaction. It is a key step toward robots that behave less like machines and more like responsive partners.",
      "What this technology means for the future of robots",
      "The next challenge is sensitivity. The researchers want the skin to recognize multiple touches at the same time without confusion. If successful, robots could handle complex physical tasks while staying alert to danger across their entire surface. That brings humanoid robots one step closer to acting on instinct.",

      "What's inside these streaming boxes",
      "According to an investigation by Krebs on Security, media streaming devices don't behave like ordinary media streamers once they're connected to your network. Researchers closely examine SuperBox, which is an Android-based streaming box sold through third-party sellers on major retail platforms. On paper, SuperBox markets itself as just hardware. The company claims it doesn't pre-install pirated apps and insists users are responsible for what they install. That sounds reassuring until you look at how the device actually works.",
      "To unlock the thousands of channels SuperBox advertises, you must first remove Google's official app ecosystem and replace it with an unofficial app store. That step alone should raise eyebrows. Once those custom apps are installed, the device doesn't just stream video but also begins routing internet traffic through third-party proxy networks.",
      "What this means is that your home internet connection may be used to relay traffic for other people. That traffic can include ad fraud, credential stuffing attempts and large-scale web scraping.",
      "During testing by Censys, a cyber intelligence company that tracks internet-connected devices, SuperBox models immediately contacted servers tied to Tencent's QQ messaging service, run by Tencent, as well as a residential proxy service called Grass.",
      "Grass describes itself as an opt-in network that lets you earn rewards by sharing unused internet bandwidth. This suggests that SuperBox devices may be using SDKs or tooling that hijack bandwidth without clear user consent, effectively turning the box into a node inside a proxy network.",
      "Why SuperBox activity resembles botnet behavior",
      "In simple terms, a botnet is a large group of compromised devices that work together to route traffic or perform online tasks without the owners realizing it.",
      "Researchers discovered SuperBox devices contained advanced networking and remote access tools that have no business being on a streaming box. These included utilities like Tcpdump and Netcat, which are commonly used for network monitoring and traffic interception.",
      "The devices performed DNS hijacking and ARP poisoning on local networks, techniques used to redirect traffic and impersonate other devices on the same network. Some models even contained directories labeled \"secondstage,\" suggesting additional payloads or functionality beyond streaming.",
      "SuperBox is just one brand in a crowded market of no-name Android streaming devices. Many of them promise free content and quick setup, but often come preloaded with malware or require unofficial app stores that expose users to serious risk.",
      "In July 2025, Google filed a lawsuit against operators behind what it called the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, a network of more than ten million compromised Android devices. These devices were used for advertising fraud and proxy services, and many were infected before consumers even bought them.",
      "Around the same time, the Feds warned that compromised streaming and IoT devices were\u00a0being used to gain unauthorized access to home networks\u00a0and funnel traffic into criminal proxy services.",
      "We reached out to SuperBox for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "8 steps you can take to protect yourself",
      "If you already own one of these streaming boxes or are thinking about buying one, these steps can help reduce your risk significantly.",
      "If a streaming box asks you to remove Google Play or install apps from an unknown marketplace, stop right there. This bypasses Android's built-in security checks and opens the door to malicious software. Legitimate Android TV devices don't require this.",
      "Even if the box itself is compromised, strong antivirus software on your computers and phones can detect suspicious network behavior, malicious connections or follow-on attacks like credential stuffing. Strong antivirus software monitors behavior, not just files, which matters when malware operates quietly in the background. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your internet connection is being abused, stolen credentials often come next. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one leak doesn't unlock everything. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on suspicious or fake websites, which can alert you before you make a mistake.",

      "Streaming boxes like SuperBox thrive on frustration. As subscriptions pile up, people look for shortcuts. But when a device promises everything for nothing, it's worth asking what it's really doing behind the scenes. Research shows that some of these boxes don't just stream TV. They quietly turn your home network into a resource for others, sometimes for criminal activity. Cutting the cord shouldn't mean giving up control of your internet connection. Before plugging in that \"too good to be true\" box, it's worth slowing down and looking a little closer.",

    "summary": "Email scams are targeting seniors at alarming rates, threatening life savings with a single click. Discover how families can add digital guardrails today.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson shares practical ways to avoid falling victim to AI-generated phishing scams and discusses a report that North Korean agents are posing as I.T. workers to funnel money into the country's nuclear program.",
      "Email scams have become one of the fastest ways scammers steal money from older adults. A single click can expose bank accounts, personal data and retirement savings built over a lifetime. That growing risk is what prompted Bob to write to us with a question many families are now facing:",
      "\"My friend's father is 95 and absolutely lives through his phone/laptop. He refuses to give up either and often clicks on email links. A few years ago, he got caught up in a gift card scam that almost cost him his life savings. It's not taking away the car keys anymore; it is taking away the email and access to online banking! What do you recommend that his daughter do to protect his online presence?\"",
      "Bob is right. For many seniors, email and online banking have replaced car keys as the most dangerous access point. The goal is not to take devices away. It is to quietly put guardrails in place so one bad click does not turn into a financial disaster.",
      "Here is a practical plan families can actually use.",
      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",

      "1) Separate money from daily email use",
      "Start by limiting how much damage a single click can cause. If possible, remove online banking access from the devices used for email. When that is not realistic, open a second checking account with only everyday spending money and link it to a debit card for routine purchases.",
      "Keep primary savings accounts offline or set to view-only access. If available, require in-branch or phone verification for transfers above a set amount. This way, even if credentials are compromised, the largest accounts remain protected.",
      "2) Lock down email to stop scams targeting seniors",
      "Email is the number one entry point for scams targeting seniors. Strong filtering matters. Use an email provider with advanced spam protection, such as Gmail or Outlook.com. In the email settings:",
      "Turn off automatic image loadingDisable link previewsBlock or auto-quarantine attachments from unknown sendersAutomatically move messages from unknown senders to a Review folder",

      "Disable link previews",
      "Block or auto-quarantine attachments from unknown senders",
      "Automatically move messages from unknown senders to a Review folder",
      "If available, enable warnings for emails that use familiar display names but come from unfamiliar addresses. This helps stop impersonation scams that pretend to be family, banks or service providers. These steps slow scammers down and reduce impulse clicks before damage happens.",
      "Email is dominant, but voicemail and callback scams are also growing fast among seniors, often as a follow-up to phishing emails. If possible,\u00a0silence unknown callers and block voicemail-to-email transcription for unfamiliar numbers, since many scams now start with urgent callback messages rather than links.",
      "Email scams often start with messages that look routine but hide urgent threats designed to trigger quick clicks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Add a trusted second set of eyes",
      "Next, add safety nets that notify family members when something looks wrong. Enable banking alerts for large withdrawals, new payees, password changes, unusual logins and new device sign-ins. Add his daughter as a trusted contact wherever the bank allows it. If available, enable delays or approval requirements for first-time transfers to new payees. This creates a cooling period that can stop scam-driven transactions. For email accounts, set up a recovery contact so that his daughter is notified immediately if someone attempts to access or reset the account.",
      "Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) on email and banking accounts, but pair it with device and transfer alerts, since many scams now succeed even when 2FA is enabled.",
      "4) Harden devices so clicks do not equal catastrophe",
      "Devices should be set up to fail safely. Keep operating systems and browsers updated. Make sure the laptop uses a standard user account instead of an administrator account. This prevents software from installing without approval. Install real-time protection that blocks scam sites before they load. Strong antivirus software helps block malicious links and fake login pages automatically.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "5) Use a password manager to block fake logins",
      "Password reuse makes scams far more dangerous. Fake pop-ups and lookalike websites are designed to trick people into typing usernames and passwords by hand. A password manager removes that risk by storing credentials securely and autofilling them only on legitimate websites. If a page is fake or malicious, the password manager will not fill anything. That simple refusal often prevents account takeovers before they start. Password managers also reduce frustration by eliminating the need to remember or reuse passwords across email, banking and shopping accounts. When set up correctly, this protection works quietly in the background on both phones and laptops.",
      "Many\u00a0phishing scams no longer rely on obvious fake emails. They rely on realistic login pages. Autofill protection is one of the most effective ways to stop these attacks without changing daily habits.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "6) Freeze credit and monitor identity exposure",
      "If scammers already have personal information, prevention alone is not enough. Freeze credit with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax to prevent new accounts from being opened. Also, place freezes with ChexSystems and the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange to stop criminals from opening bank accounts, phone lines, or utility services in his name.",
      "If possible, request an IRS Identity Protection PIN to prevent tax-related identity theft.",
      "Add ongoing identity monitoring so suspicious activity triggers alerts quickly. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "7) Set clear rules around scams and payments",
      "Technology helps, but expectations matter. Have one calm conversation and agree on simple rules:",
      "No gift cards for urgent emails or textsNo sending money through unfamiliar apps or cryptocurrencyAlways call a trusted family member before acting on urgency",
      "No gift cards for urgent emails or texts",
      "No sending money through unfamiliar apps or cryptocurrency",
      "Always call a trusted family member before acting on urgency",
      "Post these rules near the computer or phone. Visual reminders reduce panic decisions. Also, before setting rules, choose one primary trusted contact. Multiple helpers can slow response during urgent scams and create confusion when fast decisions matter. That person should be the default call for anything urgent involving money, account access, or unexpected requests.",
      "Adult children increasingly step in to help parents spot red flags before a simple mistake turns into a financial loss. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8) Reduce exposure with a data removal service",
      "Scammers often find seniors by pulling personal details from public data broker websites. These sites publish phone numbers, addresses, relatives and age information that make targeting easier. A data removal service works behind the scenes to opt seniors out of these databases and reduce how much personal information is publicly available online. Fewer exposed details means fewer scam calls, fewer phishing emails and fewer impersonation attempts. This step does not stop every scam, but it significantly lowers how often seniors are targeted in the first place.",

      "Pro Tip: Use a secure email service for added privacy",
      "For families looking to go a step further, switching to a secure email service can significantly reduce scam exposure. Privacy-focused email providers are designed to limit tracking, block hidden tracking pixels, and reduce how much data advertisers or scammers can collect from inbox activity. Many secure email services also offer disposable or alias email addresses for one-time signups. If an alias starts receiving spam or scam messages, it can be disabled without affecting the main email account. This makes it easier to keep a primary email address private and limit long-term exposure. Secure email platforms typically include features like encrypted messages, no advertising and stronger privacy controls. While switching email providers is optional, it can be a useful upgrade for seniors who receive large volumes of spam or have been repeatedly targeted by scams.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Less tracking means fewer scam attempts. Aliases reduce how often personal email addresses are exposed, without changing daily habits.",

      "1) App permissions",
      "What your apps are really allowed to see",
      "Every app on your phone requests permissions, approval to access features like your camera, microphone, location, contacts or photos. Some permissions are necessary for an app to function, but many apps ask for far more access than they actually need.",

      "3) Two-factor authentication (2FA)",
      "Your second line of defense",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have, like a one-time code sent to your phone or generated by an app.",
      "Even if hackers steal your password through a\u00a0data breach or\u00a0phishing attack, 2FA can stop them from accessing your accounts. That's why security experts strongly recommend enabling it on email, banking, cloud storage and social media accounts.",
      "It may take a few extra seconds to log in, but 2FA can prevent identity theft and unauthorized access, making it one of the most powerful security tools available.",
      "Extra security tip:Strong passwords and two-factor authentication work best together. If remembering complex passwords or managing one-time codes feels overwhelming, a secure password manager can generate, store and autofill strong passwords safely.",

      "Hiding your online activity",
      "A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, masking your IP address and protecting your online activity from outsiders.",
      "VPNs are especially important when using public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels or coffee shops, where cybercriminals can intercept unprotected data. They also help limit tracking by advertisers and internet service providers.",

      "That's exactly what happened with Andover, Massachusetts-based Covenant Health. The Catholic healthcare provider has confirmed a cyberattack discovered last May may have affected nearly 500,000 patients, a sharp increase from the fewer than 8,000 people it initially reported earlier this year.",
      "A ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the incident, though Covenant Health has not publicly confirmed the use of ransomware.

      "Covenant Health detected suspicious activity in late May 2025, but investigators later confirmed attackers had already accessed systems days earlier. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened in the Covenant Health breach",
      "Covenant Health says it detected unusual activity in its IT environment May 26, 2025. A later investigation revealed that an attacker had actually gained access eight days earlier, on May 18, and was able to access patient data during that window.",
      "In July, Covenant Health told regulators that the breach affected 7,864 individuals. After completing what it describes as extensive data analysis, the organization now says that up to 478,188 individuals may have been affected.",
      "Covenant Health operates hospitals, nursing and rehabilitation centers, assisted living residences and elder care organizations across New England and parts of Pennsylvania. That wide footprint means the breach potentially touched patients across multiple states and care settings.",
      "In late June, the Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack, Bleeping Computer reported. The group alleged it stole 852 GB of data, totaling nearly 1.35 million files. Covenant Health has not confirmed those figures, but it did acknowledge that patient information was accessed.",

      "In a notice sent to regulators and patients, Covenant Health says it engaged third-party forensic specialists to investigate the incident and determine what data was involved. The organization says its data analysis is ongoing as it continues identifying individuals whose information may have been involved.",
      "Then there are the familiar statements every company makes after a breach, claiming they've strengthened the security of their IT systems to help prevent similar incidents in the future. Covenant Health says it has also set up a dedicated toll-free call center to handle questions related to the breach.",
      "Beginning Dec. 31, 2025, the organization started mailing notification letters to patients whose information may have been compromised. For individuals whose Social Security numbers may have been involved, Covenant Health is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",

      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself after the Covenant Health breach",
      "If you received a notice from Covenant Health, or if your data has been exposed in any healthcare breach, these steps can help reduce the risk of misuse.",
      "If the organization offers you credit monitoring or identity protection, take it. These services can alert you to suspicious activity tied to your Social Security number, credit file or identity details before real damage is done. If you're not offered one and want to be on the safer side, you might consider getting one yourself.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com",
      "Medical identity theft often shows up quietly. Review an explanation of benefits (EOBs), insurance claims and billing statements for services you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it to your insurer immediately.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new accounts entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is usually the safer option.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Healthcare breaches often lead to credential-stuffing attacks elsewhere. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one exposed dataset can't unlock everything else. It also makes it easier to update passwords quickly after a breach.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Breaches are frequently followed by phishing emails, texts or calls that reference the incident to sound legitimate. Attackers may pose as the healthcare provider, an insurer or a credit bureau. Don't click links or share information unless you verify the source independently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Once your data leaks, it often spreads across data broker sites. Personal data removal services help reduce your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from these databases. While they can't erase everything, they lower your exposure and make targeted fraud harder.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "You're entitled to free credit reports from all major bureaus. Check them for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or address changes. Catching fraud early makes it far easier to contain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare organizations remain prime targets for cybercriminal groups because of the volume and sensitivity of the data they store. Medical records contain a mix of personal, financial and health information that is difficult to change once exposed. Unlike a password, you cannot reset a diagnosis or treatment history. This breach also shows how early disclosures often underestimate impact. Large healthcare networks rely on complex systems and third-party vendors, which can slow forensic analysis in the early stages. As investigations continue, the number of affected individuals often climbs.",

      "Grok, the built-in chatbot on X, is facing intense scrutiny after acknowledging it generated and shared an AI image depicting two young girls in sexualized attire.",
      "In a public post on X, Grok admitted the content \"violated ethical standards\" and \"potentially U.S. laws on child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\" The chatbot added, \"It was a failure in safeguards, and I'm sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.\"",

      "The fallout from this incident has triggered global scrutiny, with governments and safety groups questioning whether AI platforms are doing enough to protect children.\u00a0 (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Grok quietly restricts image tools to paying users after backlash",
      "As criticism mounted, Grok confirmed it has begun limiting image generation and editing features to paying subscribers only. In a late-night reply on X, the chatbot stated that image tools are now locked behind a premium subscription, directing users to sign up to regain access.",
      "The apology that raised more questions",
      "Grok's apology appeared only after a user prompted the chatbot to write a heartfelt explanation for people lacking context. In other words, the system did not proactively address the issue. It responded because someone asked it to.",
      "Around the same time, researchers and journalists uncovered widespread misuse of Grok's image tools. According to monitoring firm Copyleaks, users were generating nonconsensual, sexually manipulated images of real women, including minors and well-known figures.",
      "After reviewing Grok's publicly accessible photo feed, Copyleaks identified a conservative rate of roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute, based on images involving real people with no clear indication of consent. The firm says the misuse escalated quickly, shifting from consensual self-promotion to large-scale harassment enabled by AI.",
      "Copyleaks CEO and co-founder Alon Yamin said, \"When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal.\"",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "Grok admitted it generated and shared an AI image that violated ethical standards and may have broken U.S. child protection laws. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Sexualized images of minors are illegal",
      "This is not a gray area. Generating or distributing sexualized images of minors is a serious criminal offense in the United States and many other countries. Under U.S. federal law, such content is classified as child sexual abuse material. Penalties can include five to 20 years in prison, fines up to $250,000 and mandatory sex offender registration. Similar laws apply in the U.K. and France.",
      "In 2024, a Pennsylvania man received nearly eight years in prison for creating and possessing deepfake CSAM involving child celebrities. That case set a clear precedent. Grok itself acknowledged this legal reality in its post, stating that AI images depicting minors in sexualized contexts are illegal.",
      "The scale of the problem is growing fast",
      "A July report from the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks and removes child sexual abuse material online, shows how quickly this threat is accelerating. Reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery jumped by 400% in the first half of 2025 alone. Experts warn that AI tools lower the barrier to potential abuse. What once required technical skill or access to hidden forums can now happen through a simple prompt on a mainstream platform.",
      "Real people are being targeted",
      "The harm is not abstract. Reuters documented cases where users asked Grok to digitally undress real women whose photos were posted on X. In multiple documented cases, Grok fully complied. Even more disturbing, users targeted images of a 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher from the Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" Grok later admitted there were isolated cases in which users received images depicting minors in minimal clothing. In another Reuters investigation, a Brazilian musician described watching AI-generated bikini images of herself spread across X after users prompted Grok to alter a harmless photo. Her experience mirrors what many women and girls are now facing.",
      "Governments respond worldwide",
      "The backlash has gone global. In France, multiple ministers referred X to an investigative agency over possible violations of the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires platforms to prevent and mitigate the spread of illegal content. Violations can trigger heavy fines. In India, the country's IT ministry gave xAI 72 hours to submit a report detailing how it plans to stop the spread of obscene and sexually explicit material generated by Grok. Grok has also warned publicly that xAI could face potential probes from the Department of Justice or lawsuits tied to these failures.",

      "Researchers later found Grok was widely used to create nonconsensual, sexually altered images of real women, including minors. (Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Concerns grow over Grok's safety and government use",
      "The incident raises serious concerns about online privacy, platform security and the safeguards designed to protect minors.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X and founder of xAI, had not offered a public response at the time of publication. That silence comes at a sensitive time. Grok has been authorized for official government use under an 18-month federal contract. This approval was granted despite objections from more than 30 consumer advocacy groups that warned the system lacked proper safety testing.",
      "Over the past year, Grok has been accused by critics of spreading misinformation about major news events, promoting antisemitic rhetoric and sharing misleading health information. It also competed directly with tools like ChatGPT and Gemini while operating with fewer visible safety restrictions. Each controversy raises the same question. Can a powerful AI tool be deployed responsibly without strong oversight and enforcement?",
      "What parents and users should know",
      "If you encounter sexualized images of minors or other abusive material online, report it immediately. In the United States, you can contact the FBI tip line or seek help from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "Do not download, share, screenshot or interact with the content in any way. Even viewing or forwarding illegal material can expose you to serious legal risk.",
      "Parents should also talk with children and teens about AI image tools and social media prompts. Many of these images are created through casual requests that do not feel dangerous at first. Teaching kids to report content, close the app and tell a trusted adult can stop harm from spreading further.",
      "Platforms may fail. Safeguards may lag. But early reporting and clear conversations at home remain one of the most effective ways to protect children online.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Grok scandal highlights a dangerous reality. As AI spreads faster, these systems amplify harm at an unprecedented scale. When safeguards fail, real people suffer, and children face serious risk. At the same time, trust cannot depend on apologies issued after harm occurs. Instead, companies must earn trust through strong safety design, constant monitoring and real accountability when problems emerge.",

      "Those steps help, but they don't remove your data from broker databases. Credit monitoring services alert you after something goes wrong. Password changes don't affect public profiles. And unsubscribing doesn't stop data resale. If your personal information is still sitting in hundreds of databases, scammers can find you.",
      "The January privacy reset that actually works",
      "If you want fewer scam attempts for the rest of the year, the most effective step is removing your personal data at the source.",
      "You can do this in one of two ways. You can submit removal requests yourself, or you can use a professional data removal service to handle the process for you.",
      "Manually removing your data means identifying dozens or even hundreds of data broker websites, finding their opt-out forms and submitting removal requests one by one. You also need to verify your identity, track responses and repeat the process whenever your information reappears.",

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

The longer your personal information stays online, the more complete-and dangerous-your digital profile becomes. The good news? You can stop the cycle. Removing your data now reduces scam attempts, protects your identity, and gives you a quieter, safer year ahead. If you're going to make one privacy move this year, make it early-and make it count.",

      "CES 2026 was packed with moments that made people stop and stare. Some of the tech felt practical. Some of it felt a bit wild. However, these 10 showstoppers were the ones everyone kept talking about on the show floor.",

      "1) LG Wallpaper TV",
      "LG pushed TV design to the edge of invisibility once again at CES 2026. The latest Wallpaper TV, officially called the LG OLED evo W6, is just 9mm thin and sits completely flush against the wall. From the side, it looks more like glass than a television.",
      "This version feels far more practical than earlier Wallpaper models. All inputs live in a separate Zero Connect Box, which wirelessly sends visually lossless 4K video and audio to the screen from up to 30 feet away. That keeps cables out of sight and gives you more freedom when placing the TV.",
      "THIS EV HAS A FACE, AND IT TALKS BACK WITH AI",
      "The LG CLOiD robot and the LG OLED evo AI Wallpaper TV are displayed onstage during an LG Electronics news conference at CES 2026, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026. (REUTERS/Steve Marcus)",
      "Picture quality also takes a major step forward. LG's new Hyper Radiant Color Technology boosts brightness, improves color accuracy and deepens blacks while cutting screen reflections. With Brightness Booster Ultra, the Wallpaper TV reaches up to 3.9 times the brightness of conventional OLEDs and stays easy to watch even in bright rooms.",
      "Powering it all is LG's new Alpha 11 AI Processor Gen3. Its upgraded Dual AI Engine preserves natural detail while reducing noise, avoiding the overly sharp look that plagues some high-end TVs. Gamers also get plenty to like, including 4K at up to 165Hz, ultra-fast response times and support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium.",
      "Availability: Expected later in 2026 through select retailers.",
      "2) Dreame Cyber X Stair-Climbing Robot Vacuum",
      "Dreame showed plenty of power at CES 2026, but the real jaw-dropper was the Cyber X concept. This robot vacuum uses a four-legged base that lets it climb stairs on its own, turning multi-level cleaning into something that finally feels automated.",
      "The design looks unusual at first, almost like a robot pet. Once it starts moving, though, the idea clicks. A built-in water tank reduces trips back to the dock, which should help extend cleaning sessions and preserve battery life.",
      "Dreame\u2019s Cyber X concept uses a four-legged design to climb stairs on its own, hinting at a new era of autonomous home robots. (Dreame)",
      "It's still a concept, but Cyber X feels like a glimpse at where home robots are headed. Less rolling around. More real autonomy.",
      "Availability: Concept product.",
      "3) SwitchBot AI MindClip",
      "SwitchBot joined the growing AI wearable trend with the MindClip, a tiny device designed to act like a second brain. It clips on easily, weighs just 18 grams and stays out of the way while quietly doing its job.",
      "MindClip can record conversations and meetings, summarize calls and create AI-powered notes. It also supports more than 100 languages, making it useful for work, travel or multilingual households. Like similar devices, it lets you listen back to recordings and read transcriptions later.",
      "Where MindClip aims to stand out is in memory. SwitchBot says users will be able to search past recordings and track down important details it captured earlier, turning everyday conversations into a searchable archive. That could be especially helpful for busy professionals and students who juggle calls, classes and meetings.",
      "The tiny MindClip clips on discreetly while recording, transcribing and organizing conversations using AI. (SwitchBot)",
      "Details are still limited, and no pricing has been announced. SwitchBot has hinted that many key features will require a subscription, which puts it in line with competing AI wearables.",
      "Availability: Not yet available. Pricing and preorder details have not been released.",
      "4) LG CLOiD Home Robot",
      "LG didn't just show off a concept robot at CES. It showed a glimpse of what a true AI-powered home might look like.",
      "At LG Electronics' booth at CES 2026, the company unveiled LG CLOiD, a home robot designed to handle real household chores as part of its \"Zero Labor Home\" vision. This isn't just a rolling assistant. CLOiD can fold laundry, help in the kitchen and move safely around furniture.",
      "The robot uses a stable, wheeled base inspired by robot vacuums, paired with a tilting torso and two articulated arms. Each arm has human-like movement and individual fingers, allowing CLOiD to grip, lift and place objects with surprising precision. In demos, it retrieved items from the fridge, loaded an oven and folded clothes after a laundry cycle.",
      "CLOiD's head acts as a mobile AI home hub, using cameras, sensors and voice-based AI to understand routines and control LG's ThinQ-connected appliances. It still feels futuristic and a little unsettling, but the technology behind it is hard to ignore. If LG can make it practical and affordable, CLOiD could mark a real step toward AI doing the housework for us.",
      "Availability: Concept and research-stage technology. Not planned for consumer sale at this time.",
      "5) Glyde Smart Hair Clippers",
      "Glyde is trying to solve one of the most frustrating parts of grooming: cutting your own hair without messing it up.",
      "The company introduced AI-powered smart hair clippers designed to guide the cut for you. You wear a simple headband that marks where a fade should start, choose a style in the app and let the clippers do the rest. Built-in sensors track your speed, angle and movement in real time, automatically adjusting the blade to keep cuts even and fades smooth.",
      "This is very much a trust exercise. You're letting software guide sharp blades near your head, and that won't be for everyone. But for people who skip the barber, hate appointments or just want a quick cleanup at home, the idea makes sense.",
      "Glyde's system is built to be \"mistake-proof.\" Move too fast, and the blade retracts. Tilt it the wrong way, and it trims less. Popular styles like buzz cuts, crew cuts and side parts are baked into the app, with step-by-step guidance that adapts as you cut.",
      "It's a one-time investment meant to replace repeat barber visits. If it works as promised, Glyde could turn haircuts into a 10-minute task you do on your own schedule.",
      "Availability: Limited early access or direct sales may come later in 2026.",
      "6) LEGO Smart Bricks",
      "LEGO is adding a digital twist to its classic bricks, and surprisingly, it works. At CES, LEGO introduced LEGO Smart Play, a new line built around \"Smart Bricks\" that look like regular LEGO pieces but hide sensors, LEDs and speakers inside. The bricks can detect movement, distance and interaction, lighting up, changing color and producing sound effects in real time as kids play.",
      "The launch leans heavily into Star Wars, including sets with Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, an X-Wing and a TIE fighter. In one demo, a Luke minifigure produced its own lightsaber sounds. In another, bricks made swooshing and crashing noises when attached to vehicles, while figures reacted when they were \"hit.\" It felt playful, immersive and instantly understandable.",
      "A LEGO piece with a smart brick attached is displayed during a LEGO news conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)",
      "Smart Tags snap into the bricks to control different behaviors, and a quick shake wakes everything up. Pricing starts around $70 and climbs to about $160, with Star Wars sets arriving in March. LEGO hasn't shared details on battery life yet, but the goal is clear: add interactivity without pushing kids toward screens.",
      "This feels like LEGO doing tech the right way. You still build with your hands, imagine the story and snap bricks together. The technology simply brings the play to life.",
      "Availability: Launching March 2026. Expected to be sold through LEGO and major retailers.",
      "7) Autoliv Foldable Steering Wheel",
      "This might look like a small change, but it could completely reshape future car interiors.",
      "Autoliv unveiled the world's first foldable steering wheel designed for Level 4 autonomous vehicles. When the car switches into self-driving mode, the steering wheel retracts smoothly into the dashboard, opening up the cabin and giving occupants more space to relax, work or just stretch out.",
      "What makes this impressive is that safety isn't sacrificed. Autoliv built an adaptive airbag system that changes with the driving mode. When you're driving manually, the airbag lives in the steering wheel as usual. Once the wheel folds away in autonomous mode, a separate airbag in the instrument panel takes over, keeping protection intact at all times.",
      "It's a smart, practical solution to a problem automakers are already facing. If cars don't always need a steering wheel, why should it always be in the way? Autoliv's design shows how autonomy isn't just about software, it's about rethinking the entire cabin experience.",
      "Availability: Automotive supplier technology for future vehicles.",
      "8) TDM Neo Hybrid Headphones",
      "These might be the most interesting headphones at CES for one simple reason: they refuse to stay just headphones.",
      "Tomorrow Doesn't Matter, better known as TDM, unveiled Neo, a premium on-ear 2-in-1 hybrid headphone that physically twists into a compact Bluetooth speaker. No docking. No accessories. Just a quick rotation, and your personal audio turns into shared sound. Amazing, right?",
      "The concept might sound a bit gimmicky, but the execution feels solid. The hinge mechanism is sturdy, the transformation is intuitive, and the idea makes a lot of sense in real life. You can listen privately on a train, then flip Neo into speaker mode the moment you meet up with friends.",
      "TDM describes this as going from \"solo to social,\" and that's exactly the appeal. It blurs the line between headphones and portable speakers in a way we haven't really seen before. For travelers, outdoor users, or anyone who hates carrying multiple audio devices, Neo could be a genuinely very useful hybrid device.",
      "Availability: TDM will be launching Neo on Kickstarter later this month and will begin shipping in July.",
      "9) Jackery Solar Mars Bot",
      "Jackery made waves at CES with the Solar Mars Bot, a mobile solar generator that can move, track sunlight and recharge itself without constant setup.",
      "The Solar Mars Bot uses AI-enhanced computer vision to navigate on its own, follow its user and reposition throughout the day to capture the strongest available sunlight. Instead of manually adjusting panels or relocating gear, the system handles those decisions automatically. When not in use, its solar panels fold and retract, which helps make storage and transport more practical.",
      "What sets this system apart is how it blends mobility with energy storage. Unlike fixed solar installations that stay in one place or portable generators that must be carried and recharged by hand, the Solar Mars Bot actively manages its own power intake. It tracks the sun, recharges itself using solar energy and delivers power where it is needed.",
      "That makes it especially useful for extended power outages, off-grid living, emergency backup and outdoor adventures where access to electricity can change throughout the day. The Solar Mars Bot shows how portable power can become more intelligent, adaptable and hands-off when conditions are unpredictable.",
      "Availability: Prototype showcased at CES.",
      "10) Timeli Personal Safety Device",
      "Timeli grabbed a lot of attention at CES 2026 with a simple, immediate approach to personal safety. By combining a flashlight, HD video recording, a loud alarm, GPS tracking and live emergency dispatch into one handheld device, it earned a CES 2026 Innovation Awards Honoree and plenty of interest on the show floor.",
      "Instead of opening an app or tapping through menus, Timeli relies on muscle memory. A quick press turns on a powerful flashlight and starts recording video. If a situation escalates, pressing and holding the SOS button triggers a full safety sequence. The alarm sounds, live video begins streaming, GPS coordinates lock in and two-way communication connects directly to emergency dispatch over cellular service.",
      "That live connection matters. Timeli works with RapidSOS to give dispatchers real-time video and location data. This added clarity helps responders understand what is happening faster and send the right help sooner. Studies show video verified emergencies can cut response times dramatically, while also reducing false alarms.",
      "Timeli works even without a phone. Built-in cellular, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allow it to operate on its own or alongside the companion app for iOS and Android. Users can adjust video quality, light brightness and alarm volume to match their needs. Cloud video storage and alerts add another layer of reassurance.",
      "WORLD'S THINNEST AI GLASSES FEATURE BUILT-IN AI ASSISTANT",
      "The design stays practical. Timeli is about the size and weight of a smartphone, so it fits easily in a pocket, purse or backpack. Battery life supports long standby time, extended daily use and several hours of active protection. It even doubles as a power bank, while reserving enough charge to stay ready for emergencies.",
      "Availability:\u00a0Priced at $249 for preorder through timeli.com. Timeli includes a year of professional monitoring before transitioning to a monthly subscription.",
      "Honorable mentions: CES 2026 products worth checking out",
      "These products also stood out on the CES 2026 show floor, highlighting smart design choices and meaningful innovation that point to the future of consumer tech.",
      "ASUS reimagined portable productivity with the 2026 Zenbook Duo. This laptop snaps two 14-inch 3K ASUS Lumina OLED touchscreens together into a single mobile workstation you can carry with one hand.",
      "The dual-screen setup lets you keep a main project open on one display while chats, calls or reference material live on the other. That alone cuts down on constant app switching. The OLED panels deliver rich color, deep blacks, smooth motion and built-in eye care that makes long sessions easier on your eyes.",
      "ASUS also upgraded what you hear. A new six-speaker system replaces the previous two-speaker design, creating fuller, more immersive audio for movies, music, and calls. Everything is wrapped in a Ceraluminum ceramic finish that resists fingerprints and scratches while feeling premium in hand.",
      "Availability: Expected early 2026. Pricing has not been announced.",
      "SpotOn focused on precision and reliability with the launch of the SpotOn GPS Fence Nova Edition. This is a GPS dog fence system designed to create virtual fences anywhere, from small yards to massive rural properties, with no subscription required.",
      "What sets Nova apart is its advanced antenna and receiver system. SpotOn uses a dual-band, dual-feed active antenna paired with a dual-band receiver that reduces GPS drift by up to 40% and delivers accuracy up to eight times better than competing systems. In third-party testing, it achieved 100% reliable containment.",
      "Owners can create unlimited fences by walking boundaries, drawing them in the app, or placing GPS fenceposts automatically. The collar also includes intelligent audio cues, optional static correction, custom voice commands, LED prompts and sizing that grows with your dog. If a dog ever leaves the fence, tracking tools are available through the app or SpotOn support.",
      "Availability: Available in the US and Canada for $999.",
      "Lenovo took handheld gaming seriously with the Legion Go powered by SteamOS. This is the most powerful Legion handheld to ship natively with SteamOS, blending desktop-class performance with console-like simplicity.",
      "It features an 8.8-inch PureSight OLED display and can be configured with up to an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, up to 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and up to 2TB of PCIe SSD storage with expansion via microSD. SteamOS is tuned for gamepad controls and quick access, with features like fast suspend and resume, cloud saves, Steam Chat and built-in game recording.",
      "The result feels less like a mini PC and more like a true console you can carry. You get instant access to your Steam library without juggling operating systems or launchers.",
      "Availability: On sale June 2026. Starting price is $1,199.",
      "SanDisk introduced a new internal drive brand at CES, and the Optimus GX 7100M is its first standout. Built for handheld gaming consoles and thin and light laptops, this PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD delivers speeds up to 7,250 MB per second.",
      "The drive is available in capacities up to 2TB, giving gamers faster load times, more room for large libraries and smoother performance on the go. It is designed for devices that support an M.2 2230 slot, including popular handheld consoles and compact laptops.",
      "This launch also marks the debut of the SanDisk Optimus name, which will replace the company's internal SSD lineup for gamers, creators and professionals moving forward.",
      "Availability: Expected early spring 2026. Pricing will be announced closer to release.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CES 2026 made one thing clear. Tech companies are taking bigger swings than ever. Some of these products feel close to becoming part of everyday life. Others may stay experimental for years. That's what makes CES so fascinating. It gives us an early look at where technology could be headed and sparks conversations about what we actually want in our homes, cars and daily routines.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 08:40:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Cybercriminals allegedly sent 9,000+ phishing emails using Google Cloud tools, targeting 3,200 organizations by exploiting legitimate automation features.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals have found a clever new way to get phishing emails straight into inboxes.",
      "Instead of spoofing brands, they are abusing real cloud tools that people already trust. Security researchers say attackers recently hijacked a legitimate email feature inside Google Cloud.",
      "The result was thousands of phishing messages that looked and felt like normal Google notifications. Many slipped past spam filters with ease.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How this Google Cloud phishing attack worked",
      "At the center of the campaign was Google Cloud Application Integration. This service allows businesses to send automated email notifications from workflows they build. Attackers exploited the Send Email task inside that system. Because the messages came from a real Google address, they appeared authentic to both users and security tools.",
      "According to Check Point, a global cybersecurity firm that tracks and analyzes large-scale threat campaigns, the emails were sent from a legitimate Google-owned address and closely matched Google's notification style. Fonts, wording, and layout all looked familiar. Over a two-week period in December 2025, attackers sent more than 9,000 phishing emails targeting roughly 3,200 organizations across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.",
      "Attackers used trusted Google Cloud infrastructure to route victims through multiple redirects before revealing the scam. (Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Why Google phishing emails were so convincing",
      "The messages looked like routine workplace alerts. Some claimed you had received a voicemail. Others said you were granted access to a shared document, like a Q4 file. That sense of normalcy lowered suspicion. Many people are used to seeing these exact messages every day. Even more concerning, the emails bypassed common protections like SPF and DMARC because they were sent through Google-owned infrastructure. To email systems, nothing looked fake.",
      "What happens after you click",
      "The attack did not stop at the email. Once a victim clicked the link, they were sent to a page hosted on storage.cloud.google.com. That added another layer of trust. From there, the link redirected again to googleusercontent.com. Next came a fake CAPTCHA or image check. This step blocked automated security scanners while letting real users continue. After passing that screen, victims landed on a fake Microsoft login page hosted on a non-Microsoft domain. Any credentials entered there were captured by the attackers.",
      "Who was targeted in the Google Cloud phishing attack",
      "Check Point says the campaign focused heavily on industries that rely on automated alerts and shared documents. That included manufacturing, technology, finance, professional services, and retail. Other sectors like healthcare, education, government, energy, travel and media were also targeted. These environments see constant permission requests and file-sharing notices, which made the lures feel routine.",
      "\"We have blocked several phishing campaigns involving the misuse of an email notification feature within Google Cloud Application Integration,\" a Google spokesperson told Cyberguy. \"Importantly, this activity stemmed from the abuse of a workflow automation tool, not a compromise of Google\u2019s infrastructure. While we have implemented protections to defend users against this specific attack, we encourage continued caution as malicious actors frequently attempt to spoof trusted brands. We are taking additional steps to prevent further misuse.\"",
      "The incident demonstrates how attackers can weaponize legitimate cloud automation tools without resorting to traditional spoofing.",
      "Ways to stay safe from trusted-looking phishing emails",
      "Phishing emails are getting harder to spot, especially when attackers abuse real cloud platforms like Google Cloud. These steps help reduce risk when emails look familiar and legitimate.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency. Messages about voicemails, shared files or permission changes are designed to make you click fast. Pause before taking action. Ask yourself whether you were actually expecting that alert. If not, verify it another way.",
      "Always hover over links to preview the destination domain. In this campaign, links jumped across multiple trusted-looking Google domains before landing on a fake login page. If the final destination does not match the service asking you to sign in, close the page immediately.",
      "Shared document alerts are a favorite lure because they feel routine at work. If an email claims you were granted access to a file you do not recognize, do not click directly from the message. Instead, open your browser and sign in to Google Drive or OneDrive manually to check for new files.",
      "The final step led users to a fake Microsoft login page, where entered credentials were silently stolen. (Stack Social)",
      "Password managers can be a strong last line of defense. They will not autofill credentials on fake Microsoft or Google login pages hosted on non-official domains. If your password manager refuses to fill in a login, that is a red flag worth paying attention to.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "NEW GOOGLE AI MAKES ROBOTS SMARTER WITHOUT THE CLOUD",
      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. Many now detect malicious links, fake CAPTCHA pages, and credential harvesting sites in real time. Strong antivirus software can block phishing pages even after a click, which matters in multi-stage attacks like this one.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing campaigns often succeed because attackers already know your email, employer or role. That information is commonly pulled from data broker sites. A data removal service helps remove your personal information from these databases, making it harder for attackers to craft convincing, targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if attackers steal your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) can stop them from accessing your account. Use app-based authentication or hardware keys when possible, especially for work email, cloud storage, and Microsoft accounts.",
      "If something feels off, report it. Flag suspicious Google or Microsoft alerts to your IT or security team so they can warn others. Early reporting can stop a phishing campaign before it spreads further inside an organization.",
      "Google phishing emails looked like routine workplace alerts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This campaign highlights a growing shift in phishing tactics. Attackers no longer need to fake brands when they can abuse trusted cloud services directly. As automation becomes more common, security awareness matters more than ever. Even familiar emails deserve a second look, especially when they push urgency or ask for credentials.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:00:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers create supercapacitors from waste PET plastic bottles that could power electric vehicles and electronics within 5 to 10 years.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Each year, billions of single-use plastic bottles end up in landfills or oceans. That waste problem keeps growing. Now, a new scientific breakthrough suggests those same bottles could help power your daily life.",
      "Researchers have developed a way to transform discarded plastic water bottles into high-performance energy storage devices called supercapacitors. The work focuses on PET plastic, short for polyethylene terephthalate, which is used in most beverage bottles.",
      "The research was published in Energy & Fuels and highlighted by the American Chemical Society. Scientists say the discovery could reduce plastic pollution while helping drive cleaner energy technology.",

      "SCIENTISTS EXTRACT SILVER FROM E-WASTE USING COOKING OIL",
      "Discarded PET water bottles are one of the most common sources of plastic waste worldwide, with hundreds of billions produced each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why PET plastic waste is such a growing problem",
      "PET plastic is everywhere. According to the researchers, more than 500 billion single-use PET plastic bottles are produced every year. Most are used once and thrown away. Lead researcher Dr. Yun Hang Hu says that scale creates a major environmental challenge.",
      "Instead of letting that plastic pile up, the team focused on upcycling it into something valuable. Their idea was simple but powerful. Turn waste into materials that support renewable energy systems and reduce production costs at the same time.",
      "NEW TECH RECOVERS 92% OF EV BATTERY METALS",
      "Those upcycled materials come together to form an all-waste-plastic supercapacitor designed for fast charging and long term energy storage. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How plastic bottles can store and release energy",
      "Imagine a device that can charge fast and deliver power instantly. That is exactly what supercapacitors do. They store and release energy much faster than traditional batteries, which makes them useful for electric vehicles, solar power systems and everyday electronics.",
      "Hu's team found a way to build these energy storage components using discarded PET plastic water bottles. By reshaping the plastic at extremely high temperatures, the researchers turned waste into materials that can generate electricity efficiently and repeatedly.",
      "Here is how the process works:",
      "For the electrodes, researchers cut PET bottles into tiny, grain-sized pieces. They mixed the plastic with calcium hydroxide and heated it to nearly 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in a vacuum. That heat transformed the plastic into a porous, electrically conductive carbon powder.",
      "The powder was then formed into thin electrode layers. For the separator, small pieces of PET were flattened and carefully perforated with hot needles. This pattern allowed electric current to pass efficiently while maintaining safety and durability. Once assembled, the device used two carbon electrodes separated by the PET film and submerged in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.",
      "CIGARETTE BUTTS MAKE ROADS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE",
      "Researchers use extreme heat to convert waste PET plastic into porous carbon materials that can store and move electricity efficiently. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the results surprised scientists",
      "When tested, the all-waste-plastic supercapacitor outperformed similar devices made with traditional glass fiber separators. After repeated charging and discharging, it retained 79 percent of its energy capacity. A comparable glass fiber device retained 78 percent. That difference matters. The PET-based design costs less to produce, remains fully recyclable, and supports circular energy storage technologies where waste materials are reused instead of discarded.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could affect everyday life sooner than you might expect. Cheaper supercapacitors can lower the cost of electric vehicles, solar systems and portable electronics. Faster charging and longer device lifespans could follow. It also shows that sustainability does not require giving something up. Waste plastics could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Although this technology is still in development, the research team believes PET-based supercapacitors could reach commercial markets within 5 to 10 years. In the meantime, choosing reusable bottles and plastic-free alternatives still helps reduce waste today.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Turning trash into energy storage is more than a clever idea. It shows how science can tackle two global challenges at once. Plastic pollution continues to grow. Energy demand does too. This research proves that those problems do not have to be solved separately. By rethinking waste as a resource, scientists are building a cleaner and more efficient future from materials we already throw away.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "A dangerous cybercrime tool has surfaced in underground forums, making it far easier for attackers to spread malware.",
      "Instead of relying on hidden downloads, this tool pushes fake error messages that pressure you into fixing problems that never existed. Security researchers say this method is spreading quickly because it feels legitimate. The page looks broken. The warning feels urgent. The fix sounds simple.",
      "That combination is proving alarmingly effective for cybercriminals.",

      "How fake error malware attacks actually work",
      "These attacks begin with a compromised website. When a visitor lands on the page, something looks wrong right away. Text appears broken. Fonts look scrambled. Visual elements seem corrupted. A pop-up then appears claiming the issue can be fixed with a browser update or a missing system font. A button offers to repair the problem instantly.",
      "Clicking that button copies a command to the clipboard and displays instructions to paste it into PowerShell or a system terminal. That single step launches the infection.",

      "Fake error popups make a website look broken by scrambling text or fonts to create urgency and panic. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Why this new tool changes the threat landscape",
      "The tool behind these attacks is called ErrTraffic. It automates the entire process and removes the technical barriers that once limited cybercrime operations. For about $800, attackers get a full package with a control panel and scripted payload delivery. Analysts at the Hudson Rock Threat Intelligence Team identified the tool after tracking its promotion on Russian-language forums in early December 2025.",
      "ErrTraffic works through a simple JavaScript injection. A single line of code connects a hacked site to the attacker's dashboard. From there, everything adapts automatically. The script detects the operating system and browser. It then displays a customized fake error message in the correct language. The attack works across Windows, Android, macOS and Linux.",
      "MOST PARKED DOMAINS NOW PUSH SCAMS AND MALWARE",
      "The popups often claim a browser update or missing system font is needed to fix the problem. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why security software struggles to stop it",
      "Traditional malware defenses look for suspicious downloads or unauthorized installations. ErrTraffic avoids both. Browsers see normal text copying. Security tools see a legitimate system utility being opened manually. Nothing appears out of place. That design allows the attack to slip through protections that would normally stop malware in its tracks.",
      "The success rate is deeply concerning",
      "Data pulled from active ErrTraffic campaigns shows conversion rates approaching 60%. That means more than half of the visitors who see the fake error message follow the instructions and install malware. Once active, the tool can deliver infostealers like Lumma or Vidar on Windows devices. Android targets often receive banking trojans instead. The control panel even includes geographic filtering, with built-in blocks for Russia and neighboring regions to avoid drawing attention from local authorities.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "Once malware is installed, credentials and session data are stolen. Those compromised logins are then used to breach additional websites. Each newly hacked site becomes another delivery vehicle for the same attack. That cycle allows the campaign to grow without direct involvement from the original operator.",

      "Ways to stay safe from fake error malware",
      "A few smart habits can significantly reduce risk when facing fake error pop-ups and browser-based traps.",
      "Legitimate websites never ask you to copy and paste commands into PowerShell or a system terminal. Fake error malware relies on convincing messages that pressure you into doing exactly that. If a page instructs you to run code to fix a problem, close it immediately.",
      "Fake error campaigns often use broken text, scrambled fonts or warnings about missing files to grab attention. As a result, these visuals create urgency and trigger fear. In reality, a real system problem never announces itself through a random website, so close the page right away.",
      "Real browser and operating system updates come from built-in update tools, not pop-ups on websites. If an update is needed, your device will notify you directly through system settings or trusted app stores.",
      "Strong antivirus software can help block malicious scripts, detect infostealers and stop suspicious behavior before damage spreads. This is especially important since fake error malware targets Windows, Android, macOS and Linux systems.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Stolen credentials fuel the spread of fake error malware. Removing personal information from data broker sites can reduce the impact if login details are compromised and limit how far an attack can spread.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting Cyberguy.com.",

      "Claims about missing fonts or outdated browsers are a hallmark of these attacks. Modern systems manage fonts automatically, and browsers update themselves. A webpage has no reason to request manual fixes.",
      "If a real update is needed, the operating system will request it directly. A random webpage never should.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake error malware works because it plays on a very human reaction. When something on a screen suddenly looks broken, most people want to fix it fast and move on. That split-second decision is exactly what attackers are counting on. Tools like ErrTraffic show how polished these scams have become. The messages look professional. The instructions feel routine. Nothing about the moment screams danger. But behind the scenes, one click can quietly hand over passwords, banking access and personal data. The good news is that slowing down makes a real difference. Closing a suspicious page and trusting built-in system updates can stop these attacks cold. When it comes to pop-ups claiming your device is broken, walking away is often the smartest fix.",

      "The plaintiffs accuse federal immigration agents of carrying out militarized raids across the Twin Cities, including stops at schools and hospitals, engaging in racial profiling, warrantless arrests and excessive force, and overwhelming local law enforcement, while claiming the operation was politically motivated retaliation rather than legitimate immigration enforcement.",
      "\"DHS agents have sown chaos and terror across the metropolitan area,\" Ellison said. \"Schools have gone [into] lockdown. Entire districts have had to cancel school for tens of thousands of students to ensure safety and offer online education.\"",
      "\"Local businesses are struggling,\" he added. \"Revenues are down, and some retail stores, daycares and restaurants have actually closed because people are afraid to go out.\"",
      "The lawsuit comes nearly a week after an ICE agent shot and killed a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman during a federal enforcement operation in south Minneapolis.

      "When police in Michigan arrested Jessica Plichta live on air as she finished a TV news interview supporting Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, she became an instant protest hero, seen as a victim of the heavy hand of law enforcement.",
      "The 22-year-old from Grand Rapids was widely described in media reports as a \"preschool teacher,\" an \"anti-war activist\" and protest \"organizer.\" And while those descriptions are not wrong, they were hardly comprehensive. A Fox News Digital investigation reveals they are part of a pattern in the media in which the radical ties of leftist agitators are ignored, depriving readers of a deeper and more accurate picture of their sinister goals.",
      "A booking photo of Jessica Plichta, 22, who police arrested during a protest in Grand Rapids, Michigan. (Kent County Sheriff's Office)",
      "\"Preschool Teacher, 22, Arrested on TV After Condemning Trump,\" blared a headline in The Daily Beast, above an article that noted cynically, \"Welcome to America.\" The UK-based Guardian published an article framing her as a progressive \"anti-war\" activist. And Democracy Now, an anti-Trump platform, lamented, \"Grand Rapids Police Arrest Protest Antiwar Organizer After She Condemns Trump.\"",
      "Few outlets reported that Plichta is a dedicated revolutionary in the radical Freedom Road Socialist Organization, a self-described Marxist-Leninist \"organization of revolutionaries fighting for socialism in the United States.\" The FBI in 2010 investigated the group for alleged ties to terrorist groups, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. It is part of a sprawling network of Marxist-Leninist groups funded by a China-backed billionaire and committed to sowing chaos on American streets, using issues from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to Elon Musk and President Donald Trump to fan the flames of discord.",
      "On Jan. 20, 2025, activists from the Freedom Road Socialist Organization marched across Washington, D.C., with a banner, \"FIGHT TRUMP'S AGENDA,\" and flags from the Philippines and other foreign interests where they support communist and socialist efforts. \u00a0 (Asra Q. Nomani)",
      "But while the media worked to downplay or even hide Plichta's radical ties, she has not been shy about her associations.",
      "\"I\u2019m a proud cadre member of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization!\" Plichta declared at a pro-Maduro protest Jan. 3, just hours after U.S. military forces had captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, for alleged narcoterrorism.",
      "Jessica Plichta speaks into a megaphone at a protest in Grand Rapids Michigan, Jan. 3, 2026. (IG/FRSO Grand Rapids)",
      "The Freedom Road Socialist Organization and Plichta didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Plichta\u2019s case is one in a series in which the media glosses over \u2013 essentially red-washing \u2013 the radical ideologies of far-left people and organizations involved in protests and agitation against the Trump administration. Similarly, the media has largely described anti-ICE protester Renee Nicole Good, killed by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week, as a \"37-year-old mother of three\" and \"an amazing human being,\" with little scrutiny of her participation in a militant anti-ICE group called \"Minnesota ICE Watch,\" which trains members to aggressively obstruct the work of ICE officers.",
      "For the far-left, sanitizing protesters accomplishes an organizing strategy that its consultants recommend in information warfare: \"lead with sympathetic characters.\" The goal is often to disguise coordinated revolutionary activity as grassroots activism.",
      "\"It seems there is a widespread practice in the media of identifying conservatives by their political or group affiliations,\" said Walter Kirn, a veteran journalist and editor-at-large at\u00a0County Highway, a pioneering media publication. \"They're \u2018MAGA.\u2019 They're \u2018Trump supporters.\u2019 They're \u2018far right.\u2019",
      "\"Meanwhile, on the left,\" Kirn said, \"people are described sympathetically by their roles. They're \u2018moms.\u2019 They're \u2018protesters.\u2019 It's an obvious double standard that should be corrected, particularly when membership in specific activist groups is involved.\" Kirn also edits a Substack newsletter,\u00a0\"Unbound.\"",
      "In most cases, the activist groups are transparent about their work and proud of their objectives. The stated goal of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, which planted its red \"FRSO\" flag on the street where Good was killed, is to subvert the U.S. The Freedom Road Socialist Organization receives 501(c)(3) nonprofit benefits through the Lucy Parsons Institute for Social Research, a small Chicago nonprofit which last reported $264,004 in revenues.",
      "Plichta\u2019s arrest on Jan. 3 came soon after she led the pro-Maduro protest through the streets of Grand Rapids, blocking intersections. Despite multiple warnings from police, the group refused to move to the sidewalk.",
      "She read her speech from her phone, a megaphone in her hand, and the young revolutionary didn\u2019t mince her words.",
      "\"Free Maduro! Free Maduro!\" she shouted. \"We demand his safe return to Venezuela!\"",
      "\"Join us in the struggle against imperialism!\" she continued.",

      "Soon after, at about 5:30 p.m., outside the Fountain Street Church, Plichta was giving an interview to the local TV station, WZZM 13 On Your Side, when two Grand Rapids police officers came up behind her and arrested her for obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a lawful command from a police officer. Her mouth fell open, and she slowly put her hands above her head, saying, \"I am not resisting arrest. I am going peacefully.\"",
      "Local media immediately reported the story, describing Plichta simply as a \"preschool teacher\" and protester. On Monday, she complained in an interview that police put her in their cruiser \"without buckling my seatbelt.\" The interview was staged with her comrades behind her, including one carrying a signed branded \"Freedom Road Socialist Organization.\" There was no mention of Plichta's radical ideological orientation in the story.",
      "VENEZUELAN-AMERICAN JOURNALIST SOUNDS ALARM ON PRO-MADURO PROTESTS, CALLS THEM A 'THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY'",
      "National and international media soon followed suit, making Plichta a darling of the left. But to her self-described \"comrades,\" she and Freedom Road Socialist Organization were new stars in a sprawling movement, all under the International People\u2019s Assembly, an umbrella group for about 200 communist, socialist and Marxist-Leninist groups worldwide. That group has more on its agenda than stopping the Trump administration from arresting illegal immigrants or even toppling South American dictators.",
      "The International People\u2019s Assembly is supported by controversial U.S. tech tycoon Neville Roy Singham, currently under investigation by the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee as an alleged propagandist for the Chinese Communist Party. Singham finances a number of groups in the U.S. in the socialist-communist network, fomenting anti-American sentiment on the streets, including The Answer Coalition, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, BreakThrough News and Code Pink, co-founded by his wife, Jodie Evans.",
      "On Aug. 19, 2024, members of Freedom Road Socialist Organization joined about 200 other groups, many of them socialist and Palestinian, in Chicago to march to protest the Democratic National Convention. Its members held signs calling for \"VICTORY TO THE PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE.\" The Hamas terrorist group calls itself \"the resistance.\" (Asra Q. Nomani)",
      "In recent days, these groups have been actively mobilizing socialist, communist and Marxist-Leninist members nationwide to protest U.S. \"imperialist\" policies against immigrants, Venezuela, Palestinians and a host of other issues. Even there, major news outlets are largely ignoring the role of far-left groups in organizing the protests and describing them instead with sweeping statements framed as national consensus. CNN called the protests a \"nationwide outcry,\" while the New York Times described the demonstrations as a \"mounting outrage. Neither CNN nor the New York Times described the demonstrations' openly socialist organizers, even though the New York Times published two photos of the trademark black-and-white signs of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, its name in bold letters across the signs, and it even published one photo with \"FRSO\" and \"Freedom Road Socialist Organization\" across the bottom.",
      "In its investigation of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, according to internal documents made public, the FBI launched its query in 2010 to see whether U.S. activists associated with the organization provided material support to foreign groups designated by the State Department as terrorist organizations. That investigation resulted in raids of activists\u2019 homes and offices that the group called \"repression\" but didn\u2019t lead to criminal charges.",
      "CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION PROMOTES VENEZUELA REGIME CHANGE PROTESTS ORGANIZED BY SOCIALIST GROUPS",
      "The Freedom Road Socialist Organization and its network of socialist organizations hosting the anti-ICE protests believe the U.S. capitalist system must be abolished, and they support the communist governments of Cuba, China, Russia and North Korea.",
      "It framed Plichta\u2019s arrest as part of a pattern of \"repression\" against revolutionary activists.",
      "Plichta's case illustrates how revolutionary groups can embed themselves within mainstream protest movements, like an insurgency, leveraging popular causes to advance a far more radical political agenda.",
      "Whether the media was oblivious or purposeful, the clues to Plichta's ideological radicalization were all there. She emerged from her brief stint at Kent County Correctional Facility with a red shirt with \"FRSO\" visible behind her winter jacket.",
      "On May 1, 2025, members of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization protested in Washington, D.C., blocks from the White House to support labor rights. \"DOWN WITH BILLIONAIRES,\" a sign read, with an image of Elon Musk. \"WE NEED SOCIALISM.\" (Asra Q. Nomani)",
      "Inside the Fountain Street Church, the group\u2019s organizational secretary, Tom Burke, president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 26, gave the local chapter a pep talk in its defense of Maduro, its members leaning on their protest signs as they listened intently. One sign read: \"Regime change begins at Home.\"",

      "As anti-regime protests continue to spread across Iran and questions swirl about the durability of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\u2019s rule, a central question looms: Who would actually take power if the Islamic Republic were to collapse?",
      "The answer, according to regional experts and Iranian opposition figures, is far from clear. It may depend less on ideology than on how the regime falls and whether Iran\u2019s security forces fracture or hold.",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the critical variable is not simply whether the regime collapses, but how it happens.",

      "\"Despite being supreme leader, one has to wonder, especially post-war and with limited public appearances, how much Khamenei is directly governing the affairs of the country,\" Ben Taleblu told Fox News Digital. He warned Western governments against backing a cosmetic transition that merely reshuffles elites.",
      "\"One thing I fear is the Western temptation for a Maduro-type or Egypt-type model,\" he said, referring to scenarios in which entrenched security forces retain power under new leadership. \"That will only be playing musical chairs at the top and will not provide the Iranian people a pathway for meaningful change.\"",
      "Ben Taleblu argued that Iran\u2019s opposition faces a logistical challenge more than an ideological one: translating sustained street protests into organized political power before security forces reassert control.",

      "Multiple experts agreed that Iran\u2019s future hinges on whether the regime\u2019s coercive apparatus, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij militia and the regular military, remains intact.",
      "Ben Taleblu said the key factor is whether segments of the security forces defect, refuse orders or fragment. \"What has to be chipped away is the regime\u2019s coercive power,\" he said, adding that a transition would require sustained protests, economic strikes and cracks within security units.",
      "Without that, analysts warn, Iran could see a scenario in which clerical figureheads disappear but real power remains in the hands of armed institutions.",
      "\"That\u2019s the fear,\" Ben Taleblu said. \"If the state plays musical chairs, the street will not settle for it. That means a bumpier road ahead.\"",

      "Some analysts point to historical precedents, including Egypt, where the military stepped in amid unrest. Benny Sabti, an Iran expert at Israel\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies, said a military-led transition cannot be ruled out, but would be fraught.",
      "\"IRGC generals could theoretically attempt a coup,\" Sabti told Fox News Digital, stressing that Iran\u2019s military institutions are not monolithic. He distinguished between the IRGC, which he described as an ideological and asymmetric force, and the regular army, which he said is more professional and nationally oriented.",
      "Sabti highlighted former armed forces chief Habibollah Sayyari as an example of a figure who has voiced limited criticism from within the system. Still, he cautioned that criticism alone does not make a leader and said charisma matters deeply in Iranian politics.",

      "\"There is a problem of charisma,\" Sabti said. \"In Iran, it is very important.\"",
      "Despite international attention on jailed activists, experts are skeptical that Iran\u2019s next political leadership would emerge from within the country\u2019s prison system.",
      "Ben Taleblu said decades of repression have made it nearly impossible to cultivate political leadership inside Iran. \"What will come from within are the forces of revolution,\" he said. \"Political leadership has to be built outside.\"",
      "Sabti echoed that view, saying freed prisoners would likely become part of a broader system rather than dominant leaders.",
      "\"There won\u2019t be leaders coming out of prison,\" he said. \"They will be part of a new system, but not charismatic leaders.\"",

On January 8, Pahlavi publicly called on Iranians to chant at 8 p.m. from their homes or in the streets and his aides said large crowds responded across multiple cities, including Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Ahvaz and Tabriz.",
      "Those close to Pahlavi describe him as advocating a secular, democratic Iran committed to human rights, while rejecting claims that he is seeking to restore the monarchy. Pahlavi has repeatedly said the form of Iran\u2019s future system should be decided by the people through a free constitutional process.",
      "\"My role is not to tip the scales in favor of either monarchy or republic,\" Pahlavi said. \"I will remain entirely impartial in the process to help ensure that Iranians finally have the right to choose freely.\"",
      "Banafsheh Zand, an Iranian-American journalist and editor of the \"Iran So Far Away\" Substack, told Fox News Digital that Pahlavi is the only viable unifying figure capable of guiding a transition, a view strongly contested by others in the diaspora.",

      "Zand said chants supporting Pahlavi during recent protests reflect genuine sentiment, not fabrication, though such claims are difficult to independently verify amid internet shutdowns and state censorship.",

      "Rajavi pointed to the People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran and its \"Resistance Units\" as the core force behind recent uprisings, claiming they have played a decisive role in organizing protests and confronting security forces at the cost of heavy casualties. She said the National Council of Resistance of Iran does not seek power for itself, but instead proposes a six-month provisional period following the regime\u2019s overthrow, culminating in free elections for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution for a democratic, secular republic.",
      "NCRI President-elect Maryam Rajavi stands with former Vice President Mike Pence.\u00a0 (NCRI\u00a0)",

      "Rajavi also cited what she described as broad international backing for the NCRI\u2019s platform. Critics and analysts interviewed by Fox News Digital dispute the group\u2019s level of support inside Iran. Sabti said the MEK\u2019s history of violence in the 1980s and its rigid ideology have alienated younger Iranians.",
      "Speaking to an NCRI conference in Washington, D.C., last November, Pompeo pushed back against critics, stating \"A thriving, democratic, popular government in Iran\u2014not a theocracy, not a monarchy, not an oppressive regime. This will be a great thing for the entire world. We are waiting for that day, and it will be a blessing to us all.\"",

      "Following the ouster of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Jan. 3 after he and his wife were whisked away to face justice in New York, ordinary citizens of Venezuela are responding with a mix of relief, shock and uncertainty after 30 years of a brutal socialist dictatorship that bankrupted their nation.",
      "While what happens next remains largely uncertain and multiple possibilities continue to be studied by Washington, the celebratory tones seen across the country and throughout the almost 9 million citizens in the diaspora on Saturday have largely subsided into muted and cautious joy only expressed in private circles among those who longed for an end to years of economic hardship and political repression.",
      "Vera, a professor at one of the better-known universities, told Fox News Digital, \"The world cannot fathom the joy we feel. Maduro is in a federal prison in the U.S. with living conditions and rights that our political prisoners never had. For me, it is comforting to know he\u2019ll spend the rest of his life behind bars eating rice and sausage and taking showers only three times a week, paying for damaging the lives of millions of Venezuelans.\"",

      "Yet fear remains. The government has decreed any celebration of current events \u2014 and even expressions of approval of the U.S. operation in written text messages \u2014 to be a crime equivalent to national treason. Worse yet: it has empowered any law officer to check citizens and their telephones at random at hundreds of checkpoints established throughout Caracas and other regions of the country.",
      "Anyone found in violation of the decree can be immediately arrested without a trial, turning the promise of change into an anxiety-tempered state about what comes next and raising questions about sovereignty, daily survival and how to overcome yet another crisis.",
      "For Jes\u00fas, a 23-year-old university student from a middle-class family in Caracas who also works for a local business, a single word defines this past week: stress. For safety reasons, he and other Venezuelans interviewed for this story requested either partial or complete anonymity due to the security situation.",

      "\"There are police cars and officers from the national, municipal and local authorities stationed in every corner. Hundreds of checkpoints have sprung up across Caracas since the decree forbidding any celebratory expression at the U.S. operation that captured Maduro. At the first few days, there were also pro-government publicly armed colectivos (state-sanctioned citizen collectivities) doing the rounds to capture and violently repress anyone so much as expressing relief that Maduro was gone. It\u2019s been extremely difficult having to remain vigilant at all times. From prior experiences, I learned to avoid most checkpoints through alternate ways and avoiding main roads. People have been sending texts saying where the checkpoints are and telling us to delete anything that shows our support for U.S. actions from our phones.\"",
      "He continued, \"For me, personally, it\u2019s a time of mixed feelings. I am relieved to see Maduro gone and finally see a promise or discourse by either local or foreign governments to come to pass in Venezuela. While I obviously understand this only happened because of foreign interference, I much prefer a U.S. action that ends this dictatorship than preserving Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty at the cost of our country. On the other hand, I am also frightened, because once you start dismantling the established structures, you end up having chaos, and in such a case, the population suffers the most.\"",
      "Jes\u00fas adds that he transits through three main large groups of people \u2014 his student friends, his family and older relatives and his job. He adds that among his friends the mood is largely of hope that the U.S. might reshape the Venezuelan market and develop it into what he calls a \"developed\" system, where people can actually lead a better life. \"We\u2019ll finally stop being a Cuban colony and either be truly independent or a U.S.-.led country like the Dominican Republic. Nothing wrong with that. We\u2019ll still be better off and more stable,\" he added.",

      "\"Finally, at work, there is apathy. I work in a rich neighborhood where lots of government officers and military people frequent. Obviously, police officers and other government officials who benefited from the corruption and criminality are against what happened, but most military personnel say they won\u2019t die for something they didn\u2019t sign up for because of a dictatorship. At my work, we\u2019ve seen so many broken promises, that we are only bracing to stay afloat,\" he concluded.",
      "For Hannah, a recent graduate, there\u2019s relief that Maduro is gone. \"Obviously, things shouldn\u2019t be like this, and Venezuelans should be the ones deciding the future of their own country, but Maduro had to leave one way or another, and now he is gone,\" she adds.",

      "\"In the more pragmatic business elite in Venezuela, there is a lot of hope that a more normal business environment will be created now that Maduro is gone and if the U.S. plays the regime-change and economy-development cards right, even if it is to favor themselves foremost. But even then, this would be a better environment for private businesses and an enormous market ripe for renovated activity. In that sense, most people are hopeful that Maduro is finally gone, but obviously it\u2019s hard to see your own country being attacked by a foreign power,\" he says.",

I do have my personal reservations regarding Trump and the U.S., as there is evidently an economic interest on their part. We have one of the largest extra-heavy oil reserves in the world, on top of our reserves of gas, gold and coltan.\"",
      "She continued, \"The U.S. actions are not free, and we still need to see what the actual costs \u2014 which could be very high \u2014 will be. I am very sorry that this happened in my country and would be lying if I said I agreed with foreign incursions, but I am also of the opinion that our own Armed Forces should have listened to the majority of the citizens in the 2024 elections [when Maduro retained power despite losing the vote], but they chose to continue oppressing their own people. This is, therefore, part of the cost we should pay for their inoperancy,\" she said.",
      "Vera cautions that reactivating Venezuela\u2019s economic growth will be a medium- to-long-term task, but that when the feeling of political change is real, everything flows better, and the feeling of opportunity in the country is real right now.",

      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., asked about the Justice Department investigation, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Monday afternoon, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the case or whatever the allegations or charges are, but they better be real, and they better be serious.\u201d",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who is also on the Banking Committee, said in a statement that he believes Powell \"is a bad Fed Chair who has been elusive with Congress\" but added, \"I do not believe however, he is a criminal.\"",
      "\"I hope this criminal investigation can be put to rest quickly along with the remainder of Jerome Powell\u2019s term,\" Cramer said. \"We need to restore confidence in the Fed.\"",
      "Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa., a Banking Committee member whom Trump endorsed in the 2024 election, added that he did \"not think Chairman Powell is guilty of criminal activity.\"",
      "\"I believe strongly in an independent Federal Reserve. I also agree with President Trump that Chairman Powell has been slow to cut interest rates. I think the Federal Reserve renovation may well have wasted taxpayer dollars, but the proper place to fix this is through Congressional oversight,\" McCormick said in a statement Monday.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told reporters Monday that he knows Powell \"very well\" and would be \"shocked if he has done anything wrong.\"",
      "\"If you wanted to design a system to cause interest rates to go up and not down, you would have the Federal Reserve of the United States and the executive branch of the United States get into a pissing contest,\" said Kennedy, who sits on the Banking Committee.",
      "\"We don\u2019t need it. We need it like we need a hole in our head. And everybody needs to take their meds and step back a little bit,\" he added.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, another Banking Committee member, said she spoke with Powell by phone Sunday night.",
      "\u201cI watched his video, which I found to be\u00a0\u2014 to raise a lot of disturbing questions. I believe strongly in the independence of the Federal Reserve, and I know Jay Powell to be a person of integrity,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Powell said in a video statement Sunday that \u201cthe threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\u201d",
      "Asked in an interview with Fox Business on Monday whether he believed the probe was political, Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., said Trump was perhaps \u201calmost trolling here,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve got bigger issues to go after than this one.\u201d",
      "House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill, R-Ark., defended Powell as \"a person of the highest integrity\" and warned that the subpoenas \"could undermine this and future Administrations\u2019 ability to make sound monetary policy decisions.\"",
      "\u201cPursuing criminal charges relating to his testimony on building renovations at a time when the nation\u2019s economy requires focus and creates an unnecessary distraction,\u201d Hill said in a statement. Hill's committee oversees the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke Sunday evening after the Justice Department announced its investigation, two sources familiar with the conversation told NBC News.",
      "One of the sources described the situation as a mess \u2014 citing blowback from Congress \u2014 and said Bessent expressed his frustration to Trump that it creates an unnecessary distraction from other work on the Treasury Department\u2019s plate.",
      "The source also said the investigation risks further alienating GOP moderates in the Senate, which would complicate the process for Trump in an election year for Congress when he still needs their votes and support.",
      "Republicans are seeking to defend their majorities in the House and the Senate during the November midterm elections, when the incumbent president's party traditionally loses seats.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like maybe we should lose the majority so the WH and leadership stop making stupid decisions,\u201d a GOP lawmaker said in a text message Monday to NBC News. \u201cOur leadership and admin just keep doubling down on stupid.\u201d",
      "Other Republicans were supportive of the DOJ investigation. Asked by NBC News whether the probe compromises the credibility and independence of the Justice Department, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said: \u201cOf course not, no. They\u2019re doing their job.\u201d",
      "Johnson called the allegations \u201cserious\u201d and said that \u201cif the investigation is warranted, then they\u2019ll have to play that out.\u201d",
      "On whether he personally thinks the investigation is warranted, Johnson said, \u201cI have not reviewed his testimony, so I\u2019m not sure, but that\u2019s not really my lane.\u201d",
      "The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.",
      "The White House on Sunday referred a request for comment on Tillis' statement to the Justice Department. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on a specific case Sunday but said Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed her team \"to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars.\" The Federal Reserve is not funded through taxpayer dollars.",
      "Democrats have overwhelmingly rebuked the Justice Department over the probe. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday called the investigation \u201ca brazen attempt by Donald Trump to cannibalize the Fed\u2019s independence,\u201d adding the Senate should reject any future Trump nominees to the central bank so long as the probe continues.",
      "The Justice Department probe comes after months of pressure from administration officials and Trump himself for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates further. Trump has frequently lashed out at Powell in particular, calling him a \"dummy\" and \"Too Late.\" Trump nominated Powell for Fed chair in 2017.",
      "Powell's term as chair ends in May, but he has a seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors until 2028.",
      "The Federal Reserve probe is only the latest in a series of actions the Justice Department has taken against frequent targets of Trump's ire. It also indicted former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James following pressure from Trump; both cases were dropped after the prosecutor was disqualified. Former national security adviser John Bolton, who became a vocal critic of Trump after his first term, was also indicted in October."

      "The Justice Department's decision to investigate the Federal Reserve comes after a long string of threats by President Donald Trump to go after the central bank's chair, Jerome Powell.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday night that he had no advance knowledge of the Justice Department's subpoenas, which center on Powell's Senate testimony in June about the renovation of the Federal Reserve's office buildings.",
      "But Trump's displeasure \u2014 and his desire to see legal action against Powell and the agency \u2014 was out in the open. For months, he has been making remarks and posting on social media that he wants Powell gone. In the past, the Justice Department has brought charges against current and former officials Trump has publicly exhorted the attorney general to prosecute.",
      "While he has criticized the Federal Reserve's renovation project \u2014 at the same time he is pursuing a controversial renovation of the White House \u2014 the core of Trump's frustrations with Powell have stemmed from the chair's refusal to further lower interest rates to fit with the administration\u2019s agenda.",
      "On Sunday night, Powell released a video in which he went after Trump directly. The move was highly unusual for a Fed chair, who generally tries to stay out of the political fray, and the first time Powell has directly called out the president. He said the subpoenas were \"unprecedented\" and \"should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"",
      "In his brief phone call with NBC News on Sunday, Trump said the Justice Department subpoenas have nothing to do with interest rates.",
      "\u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t even think of doing it that way. What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That\u2019s the only pressure he\u2019s got,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, the tension between the two men has been evident for some time. During a tour of the Federal Reserve in July, Trump criticized Powell for the cost of the renovation project. Powell took issue with the president's assessments, saying he was misreading the documents in question.",

    "story": [
      "Within the wailing crowds, a man in a yellow sweater clings to the feet of a corpse, gently rocking, crying and moaning inaudibly. Nearby, a woman can be heard screaming, a guttural noise unmistakable for the discovery that a loved one has died.",
      "The video, shot near Iran's capital, Tehran, shows crowds of men in black winter coats pace and search for information, some speaking urgently into their cellphones. Three women in headscarves are engaged in a heated argument that turns physical, one of them is restrained by the other two as their grief turns to anger. A fourth woman sits slumped against a wall, muttering while listlessly banging her head.",
      "NBC News geolocated the video to Kahrizak Forensic Medical Center, where rows of black body bags can be seen laid inside and outside a large warehouse. Many have been partially opened so the corpses can be identified. Bloody limbs and the faces, mainly of men, are visible.",
      "The video does not appear to have circulated before Sunday but NBC News has not been able to pinpoint when exactly it was taken.",
      "Though the Iranian regime has cut the country\u2019s internet, this vignette showing the aftermath of its deadly crackdown against demonstrators emerged online Sunday.",
      "It was not clear from the video how these people died. But according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, a watchdog based in the United States, almost 600 people have been killed in the demonstrations that broke out just over two weeks ago in response to soaring prices for everyday goods. Of these, 496 were identified as protesters and 48 as security forces, HRANA said.",
      "Another human rights monitor, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights group, said on Monday that at least 694 protesters had been killed. Casualty figures vary between rights groups because the internet blackout makes it hard to speak with people in the country.",
      "Iranian authorities have released no official data, though the state-controlled IRIB broadcaster claimed, without evidence, that the \u201cmajority\u201d of the deaths were caused by the anti-government protesters themselves.",
      "With the internet shut down by the Islamic regime, gaining a clear picture is difficult. But details are getting through, and the government has noted that clips have been sent via Starlink, Elon Musk\u2019s satellite internet service. Starlink terminals are known to have been smuggled into Iran during the last large round of protests in 2022 and 2023.",
      "London-based doctor Shahram Kordasti said he has been in touch with colleagues in Iran. In recent days, he said, Iranian physicians have witnessed hundreds of dead and wounded people streaming into Tehran\u2019s hospitals, as security forces maintain a constant presence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically a massive number of deaths, injured,\u201d he told NBC News in a telephone interview. Kordasti, who is a hemato-oncologist, meaning he treats people with disorders and cancers related to the blood, also criticized a \u201clack of supply and support at the hospital\u201d and a \u201clack of communication.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of my colleagues on his way to the hospital was shot and himself injured,\u201d he said, adding that doctors he had been in contact with were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from what they had seen \u201cand they can\u2019t even talk properly.\u201d",
      "Some feel they cannot even seek medical treatment for fear of arrest by the regime\u2019s security forces, according to Kayvan Mirhadi, the chief of internal medicine at Clifton Springs Hospital near Rochester, New York.",
      "For years he has offered online medical advice to Iranian protesters among his 1.3 million Instagram followers. At the beginning of the protests, they came to him for advice on how to treat tear gas inhalation, blunt force trauma and pellet wounds, he said in a telephone interview, but that changed on Thursday when the internet went down.",
      "\u201cRather than people reaching out for advice about treating wounds you\u2019re hearing people just telling you that they\u2019re seeing protesters being killed,\u201d Mirhadi said. \u201cIt shifted after that internet blackout. The level of the violence went up.\u201d",
      "He added that he thought that over 1,000 people have been killed in Tehran since Thursday based on the information he has received. He had also heard disturbing messages from colleagues in Tehran and Mashhad, Iran\u2019s second largest city, he said.",
      "\u201cThey were saying 20 dead people just arrived, all were headshots. And I was like, \u2018What is going on? These are protests. Why are they doing headshots?\u2019\u201d Mirhadi said.",
      "\u201cEverybody was saying now they\u2019re using real guns, there\u2019s no more pellets,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s bullets with rifles, pistols, handguns, shotguns. And people are dying on the scene.\u201d"

      "The agency, Ofcom, said it was carrying out an \u201cexpedited assessment\u201d and that X had responded to its requests for information on Friday. If Ofcom finds that X violated U.K. law, it can institute penalties ranging from sanctions of 10% of its global revenue, prohibiting British companies from advertising with X, or directing the country\u2019s internet providers to block the platform.",

      "On Friday, Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, a government agency dedicated to online safety, said it had received several reports of Grok creating exploitative images and had asked X to clarify its safeguards, noting that it could issue removal notices to X. Both Australia\u2019s Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, condemned the images on Saturday.",
      "Musk and X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk and X recently posted that they prohibit users from making \u201cillegal content,\u201d but have refrained from publicly indicating that they would substantially change Grok\u2019s ability to manipulate and sexualize images of people. The creation and possession of CSAM are widely illegal around the world, but many countries also have laws restricting or prohibiting the creation of sexualized images of adult people without their consent, known as nonconsensual pornography.",
      "Early Friday, X made the Grok reply bot, which was driving the deepfake trend, a premium feature for paying subscribers, though users could still produce the deepfakes using the Grok stand-alone app in addition to other interfaces where Grok was available. While the number of such images posted to X appears to have slowed, critics like Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., have said the move is tantamount to making \u201csome of its users pay for the privilege of producing horrific images on the X app.\u201d",
      "Ofcom said its investigation would focus on whether X has been following U.K. law by quickly taking down illegal content as it became aware of it, and whether it was carrying out successful risk assessments before making \u201csignificant changes to their service.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a radio interview that Ofcom \u201chas our full support to take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is disgraceful. It\u2019s disgusting. And it\u2019s not to be tolerated,\u201d he said of the image creation. \u201cX has got to get a grip of this.\u201d",
      "India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, MeitY, also reportedly warned X last week that it was potentially violating its laws. MeitY didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "It remains unclear if any U.S. regulators will take on Musk and his companies over the manipulated images. The Federal Trade Commission did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department told NBC News last week that it was committed to holding \u201cindividuals who exploit technology to harm our most vulnerable\u201d accountable but didn\u2019t mention specific companies.",
      "A number of state attorneys general have declined to comment to NBC News on whether they are considering charges over the images.",
      "Musk has broadly pushed for X and his AI company that powers Grok, xAI, to be laxer on content moderation than most of their competitors. On Friday, he posted on X that reports of the U.K.\u2019s Labour Party wanting to potentially block X over the Grok images were evidence that \u201cThey want any excuse for censorship.\u201d",
      "Thomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said at a news conference Monday that it has given Musk and X an ultimatum to stop the production of CSAM, but stopped short of mentioning any specific penalties.",
      "\u201cDrawing a parallel between freedom of speech and an AI tool that generates child sexual abuse material is dangerous nonsense, especially when it comes from the owner of a tech company. Frankly speaking I cannot even believe we are speaking about this and engaging with this from the commission\u2019s podium in 2026,\u201d Regnier said.",
      "In December, the European Commission fined X $140 million, saying that the platform broke Europe\u2019s laws against hate speech and misinformation. That prompted criticism from the Trump administration, with both Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling it an attack on American free speech."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/astronauts-brains-change-shape-position-space-rcna253209",
    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:27:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Astronauts\u2019 brains can change shape and shift positions in space, according to a study with implications for NASA as it plans for missions to the moon and Mars.",
    "story": [
      "Astronauts\u2019 brains can change shape and shift positions during stays in space, according to a new study with implications for NASA\u2019s goals to conduct long-duration missions to the moon and Mars.",
      "The study, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that after spaceflight, astronauts\u2019 brains were tilted upward and shifted up and back in the skull relative to their normal positions on Earth. The affected areas of the brain included sensory-related regions linked to motion sickness, disorientation and loss of balance, the scientists found.",
      "The research adds to a growing but still nascent field of aerospace medicine focused on the toll that spaceflight and the microgravity environment take on the human body. Such research is crucial for planning long-term missions as NASA looks to build a base on the moon and send astronauts deeper into the solar system.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand these changes and their impacts to keep astronauts safe and healthy and protect their longevity,\u201d said Rachael Seidler, a professor in the department of applied physiology and kinesiology at the University of Florida and a co-author of the study.",
      "Seidler and her colleagues analyzed MRI scans from 26 astronauts before and after their time in orbit. The time the participants spent in space ranged from a few weeks (for space shuttle flights) to roughly six months \u2014 the standard duration for missions aboard the International Space Station. A few individuals studied spent extended, yearlong stints at the space station.",
      "\u201cThe people who went for a year showed the largest changes,\u201d Seidler said. \u201cThere were still some changes evident in people who went for two weeks, but duration seems to be the driving factor.\u201d",
      "She added that among astronauts who had stayed in space six months or longer, the upward movement was \u201cpretty extensive,\u201d particularly in structures at the top of the brain.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s on the order of a couple of millimeters,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich doesn\u2019t sound like a big number, but when you\u2019re talking about brain movement, it really is. That kind of change is visible by eye.\u201d",
      "Seidler said the brain changes observed sometimes caused \u201csensory conflicts\u201d for astronauts while in space, manifesting as temporary disorientation or motion sickness. Back on Earth, the shifts can also contribute to balance issues as the astronauts readjust to Earth\u2019s gravity. But she said the study did not find serious symptoms, such as headaches or cognitive impairment, during or after spaceflight.",
      "\u201cThat was surprising to me,\u201d Seidler said.",
      "For comparison, the research team also analyzed brain scans from 24 civilian participants on Earth who were put on bed rest for up to 60 days while tilted back, so that their heads were 6 degrees below their feet. The idea was to simulate a microgravity environment, and the scientists found similar changes in brain position and shape after the period of bed rest. The astronauts\u2019 brains experienced greater upward shift, though.",
      "Dr. Mark Rosenberg, an assistant professor of neurology at the Medical University of South Carolina and the director of its aerospace and performance neurology program, said scientists have known that spaceflight can affect the brain, but Seidler\u2019s study is one of the first to document how those upward shifts influence how astronauts function in space and back on Earth.",
      "\u201cWe knew the brain shifts upward, but does it actually have any kind of operational impact?\u201d said Rosenberg, who was not involved with the study. \u201cThis study is able to make some of those associations.\u201d",
      "The findings raise new questions for potential follow-up, such as whether there are differences between brain changes among male and female astronauts, and whether a crew member\u2019s age is a factor. Piecing together a complete picture, however, is limited by a sample size problem: Only up to a dozen or so astronauts launch to the International Space Station each year, and NASA\u2019s astronaut corps has historically been dominated by men.",
      "More research is also needed to understand if the observed brain changes have longer-term impacts.",
      "So far, like most other changes to astronauts\u2019 bodies after stints in space \u2014 including bone loss, deterioration of muscle strength and fluid redistribution \u2014 the shifts do not appear to be permanent. After the body readjusts to the familiar tug of Earth\u2019s gravity, things more or less return to normal, Rosenberg said.",
      "But it\u2019s not yet known whether different gravity environments will introduce new complications.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve been on Mars with one-third Earth\u2019s gravity, or on the moon with one-sixth Earth\u2019s gravity, will it take three or six times as long to get back to normal?\u201d Rosenberg said.",
      "He and Seidler both said the findings so far should not be viewed as an argument against humans spending extended periods in space. But it will be critical to figure out if there is any lasting damage and how to avoid it, if possible.",
      "\u201cWhether we care to admit it or not, we are eventually going to become a space-faring species,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time. And these are just some of the unanswered questions that we need to sort out.\u201d"

      "Kylie Jenner",
      "Kylie Jenner didn\u2019t walk the red carpet, but sat next to her boyfriend, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who won best actor in a drama for \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d She showed her gold gown in more detail on her Instagram.",

      "Rob Rausch was once just a guy looking for his perfect match on \u201cLove Island USA.\u201d Now, the 27-year-old reality TV star has traded the romantic villa out in Fiji for the cutthroat Scottish digs of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d\u2014 and he\u2019s playing the game as one of the villains.",
      "Peacock\u2019s addictive psychological game show is back for Season 4, during which contestants live together in a castle in Scotland while secretly plotting each other\u2019s demise. (Peacock and TODAY share a parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "The premise is devilishly simple: A group of players must work together to complete challenges and build a prize fund, but hidden among them are \u201ctraitors\u201d whose job is to secretly eliminate their fellow contestants one by one. Meanwhile, the \u201cfaithful\u201d must figure out who the traitors are and vote them off before they\u2019re picked off themselves.",
      "Rob Rausch is a Traitor on Season 4",
      "At the ever so dramatic opening roundtable ceremony, host Alan Cumming tapped Rausch to be one of the season's secret traitors and the reality star couldn't have been more thrilled with the assignment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy as can be. I honestly think I\u2019ll make a really good traitor,\u201d Rausch said after being chosen. \u201cI\u2019m hard to read, I\u2019ve been told that by every girl I\u2019ve ever dated, and I\u2019m extremely competitive. I like to win.\u201d",

I catch snakes, post videos on the internet. I\u2019m kinda quiet, but I think that\u2019s one of my biggest strengths,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen people underestimate you that\u2019s when you catch them by surprise.\u201d",
      "Who is Rob Rausch?",
      "Rob Rausch, now 27, is a snake wrangler from Florence, Alabama, according to his \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 5 bio, and he grew up on a farm with three siblings.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d viewers know just how much Rausch loves wildlife. His expertise with snakes and other creatures became his calling card when he began posting snake-wrangling content in 2021 and amassed a devoted following. A quick scroll of his socials will show that he\u2019s still passionate.",
      "His Southern charm, good looks and fearless handling of dangerous reptiles kept an interest even post-\u201cLove Island USA\u201d; when he left the show, the wildlife enthusiast became a bonafide social media influencer. To date, Rausch has 2.2 million followers on TikTok and 1.4 million on Instagram.",

      "While his snake-wrangling videos made him an internet sensation, it was reality TV that truly put Rausch on the map.",
      "He made his \u201cLove Island USA\u201d debut in Season 5 during the Casa Amor episodes \u2014 if you know, you know \u2014 but was dumped from the island just a few days later.",
      "The villa didn\u2019t bring Rausch love that first summer, but viewers were elated to see him return as an original cast member for \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6 the following year.",
      "This time, he lasted significantly longer in the show, coupling up with cast members like Leah Kateb, Andrea Carmona and Kassy Castillo as he searched for a meaningful connection.",
      "He was ultimately eliminated toward the end of Season 6. His fellow cast members later reunited for spinoff called \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa\u201d that followed their lives together in Los Angeles in 2025. Rausch, however, did not appear."

      "The film is a romantic romp, with settings like Barcelona, Tuscany, New Orleans and the woods of Canada, set to a soundtrack consisting of Robyn, Taylor Swift and Paula Abdul. And it hits all the romantic comedy beats: a hilarious miscommunication between Alex and Poppy's dad (played by Alan Ruck), a steamy kiss on a balcony in the pouring rain (the actors say it was frigid) and a sprint to profess one's love (through an Ohio neighborhood, rather than an airport).",
      "The book was first published in May 2021, marking the second in Henry's meteoric run of romantic comedies. She published six books in five years \u2014 \"Beach Read\" (2020), \"People We Meet on Vacation\" (2021), \"Book Lovers\" (2022), \"Happy Place\" (2023), \"Funny Story\" (2024), \"A Great Big Beautiful Life\" (2025) \u2014 almost all of which are currently optioned for screen adaptations.

      "Emily Bader: About two people who don't meet on vacation?",
      "TB: I think that's kind of the point. I think it's about these two people meeting new versions of each other again and again and again over time, and falling in love with each other again and again, and more and more. So it's like (gesturing between them) these are the people we meet on vacation.",
      "EB: We meet different versions of ourselves. That's it. Canon now.",
      "EB: It's funny because Poppy almost sort of is taking the role of the man character that you often see in the rom-coms. Like if we're talking \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" (she's) more Billy Crystal. And I think that's really fun. She's very carefree and takes up all the space that she wants to, which I think is an exciting new interpretation.",
      "TB: I think for Alex, his unique spin is the \"Vacation Alex\" aspect, which is him slowly coming out of his shell because of this person who gives him the power to express himself \u2014\u00a0epitomized by him stripping off and running into the sea.",
      "EB: Getting naked. (Laughs.)",

      "TB: We'd love to tell you it was super romantic to film the rain scene, but it's very cold and loud because the machines were on non-stop.",
      "EB: And I think it was like 4 in the morning. So we were very delusional. There was a lot of giggling.",
      "TB: And there was a storm in Barcelona anyway so it was already \u2014",
      "EB: It was already raining, but we couldn't \u2014",
      "TB: Couldn't use it because you can't see it on camera. But yeah, we just, we hung in there, relied on each other, and I think we pulled it off.",
      "EB: We'll see.",
      "EB: I think it's so amazing that we got to be a part of the first one. I do think that it's going to be a very long journey for her. Advice? Have fun. They're amazing people. Emily Henry's not only a genius, but a very wonderful human.",
      "TB: Very thoughtful, emotionally available human being.",
      "EB: Emotionally intelligent. And so are the fans of her books.",
      "TB: Lean in. Have fun. You can have that too much fun, that's what I learned. I went into this trying to play Alex \u2014\u00a0he's quite serious at times. But it's so much fun when he gets to release. And so, yeah, as much release as possible.",
      "EB: I think for Poppy, her music taste is also sort of seen in the way that she dresses. She's someone who reacts really strongly to something that she loves, and once she loves it, it's hers forever, even if it makes absolutely no sense in her closet or her catalog of music. And I love that about her. She just, she likes what she likes, and it's all over the map.",
      "TB: The soundtrack's amazing. (Director) Brett Haley is a musical genius. He picks songs like nobody else. I think it's going to go down in history as a great movie soundtrack.",
      "For Alex, I think the musical side of him that we didn't see, I've seen him described as a black cat boyfriend. Instead of like a golden retriever, he's more of a black cat. And so I think it's like The Smiths. \"500 Days of Summer\" kind of vibes.",
      "EB: Oh, he is such a \"500 Days of Summer\" guy. And absolutely no jazz, apparently.",
      "TB: But he's got moves."

The first four episodes of Season 4 arrived on Peacock Thursday, Jan. 8 with a supersized premiere that quickly introduced fans to the 23 cast members \u2014 featuring multiple \u201cReal Housewives\u201d alums, Olympians, Survivor winners and more celebrities \u2014 who learned if they have to play the game as a Faithful or a Traitor.",

That player\u2019s identity would remain hidden from everyone, including the audience, until later on in the game. He later selected his group of Traitors, and the Faithfuls set off to unmask them.",

After briefly meeting each other and seeing some familiar faces, they are informed about Cumming\u2019s \u201cSecret Traitor\u201d twist. Each player has a box with their name on it. One by one, they approach Cumming and he shows if their box contains a grim reaper card, confirming them as the Secret Traitor. Their identity is withheld from the audience. Everyone then moves into the castle and gathers around the Round Table for Cumming to choose the other Traitors.",

Later in the turret that night, the three learn about the Secret Traitor (who wears a special red cloak) and their power. Every week, the Secret Traitor creates a shortlist of players to be murdered until all the Traitors have the chance to team up.",

      "Back at the mansion, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams confronts actor Michael Rapaport after hearing from Dillard Bassett that he wanted to target all the housewives. But Dillard Bassett says that Williams misheard her, leading to more confusion. Cumming announces at the end of the episode to the audience that the Secret Traitor chose four out of the nine at risk players to be on the shortlist for murder. The three Traitors receive a letter from the Secret Traitor with the four names: Rausch, Ian Terry from \u201cBig Brother,\u201d Mark Ballas from \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and singer-songwriter Eric Nam.",

In his final confessional, a disappointed Terry says, \u201cI had a feeling that was going to be the case. I just don\u2019t know what I could\u2019ve done differently. But, you know what, this is the biggest backhanded compliment in this game.\u201d",
      "Before the players depart for the second mission, Williams slips up again by accidentally saying that she \u201ckilled\u201d Terry, causing comedian Ron Funches\u2019 ears to perk up. At the mission, more drama unfolds, this time between \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner Yamil \u201cYam Yam\u201d Arocho and \u201cLove Island\u201d UK star Maura Higgins. The players have to transport three players on a throne back to the castle. Along the way, they have to make multiple stops and collect gold or shields. The last players on the throne when they reach the castle will be safe from murder. Arocho takes Higgins' spot on the throne, securing his safety for the night, and Rapaport inserts himself in the conversation by claiming that he also needed a shield. He continues to call out Arocho in front of everyone when they return to the mansion. Meanwhile, Williams errs again by mentioning that there are four Traitors, adding to the list of evidence Funches is compiling.",
      "At the first Round Table, \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner Natalie Anderson kicks things off by explaining why she thinks Donna \u201cMama\u201d Kelce is a Traitor. But Funches\u2019 theory about Williams is more compelling. It is a close vote, but Williams receives one more vote than Kelce and is banished. While standing on the Circle of Truth, Williams says, \u201cI came in and I tried to fight for the housewives and it almost started to feel like I\u2019m going to be the one who is going to help to lead us to find a Traitor the first time. I am a Faithful.\u201d The group is stunned and Funches says in his confessional that he feels like he put a target on his back.",
      "Toward the end of Episode 2, the Traitors are tasked with completing a covert murder in plain sight. The Traitors must find a set of tarot cards hidden in the kitchen that reveal the second shortlist from the Secret Traitor. Next, they have to take the card of the person they want to murder and burn it in the fireplace in the breakfast room. If successful, they can meet the Secret Traitor and unite. If unsuccessful, there will not be a murder that night and they will not have any control over the next murder.",
      "Rausch spots the red reaper painting in the kitchen and instantly knows that is where the tarot cards are hidden. Meanwhile, Dillard Bassett starts a Conga line to distract the rest of the players. But \u201cSurvivor\u201d star Rob Cesternino isn\u2019t fooled. He tells \u201cBig Brother\u201d alum Tiffany Mitchell that he suspects a murder is happening in plain sight and she needs to stay alert. He also shares this theory with Dillard Bassett and Ballas.",
      "Rausch takes the tarot cards to Rinna and they discuss the shortlist: \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d star Mon\u00e9t X Change, Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski, \u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish and Cesternino. The two Traitors slip away to the breakfast room, without having time to consult with Dillard Bassett, and burn one card, murdering a player.",
      "Episode 3",
      "All the players safely arrive to breakfast the next morning except one: Cesternino. We see a flashback where he learned his fate. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they got me. I leave with no regrets. Traitors, I\u2019ll get you next time,\u201d he says.",
      "Rapaport abruptly starts targeting Arocho again about the shield from the last mission, rubbing multiple players the wrong way. Cumming arrives and shocks the players by sharing that there will be a morning Round Table meeting and banishment. Many of the players meet and agree that they will vote for Kelce to be banished. Kelce attempts to defend herself and suggests that Rapaport is a Traitor.",
      "But the players stand firm on their decision to banish her. They all vote to remove her from the game except Rapaport, who voted for Arocho, and Kelce, who voted for Rapaport.",

      "For one night, musicians \u201cunited under tragedy\u201d to commemorate one year since the Eaton Fire forever changed the Altadena, California, community.",
      "A Concert for Altadena, held on Jan. 7 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, was an emotional and uplifting night presented by the band Dawes.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2025, a fire blazed through the Eaton canyon, making its way towards the mountain town of Altadena. On the far west side of Los Angeles, the Palisades fire was also blazing and wreaking havoc. A total of 31 people died and the fires destroyed about 13,000 homes and residential properties, leaving thousands displaced.",
      "To pay tribute to the lives, homes and businesses lost, the one-night benefit concert brought the Altadena community together in hopes of raising money for the Altadena Builds Back Foundation. The organization helps provide resources and options for people who want to stay and rebuild in Altadena.",
      "\u201cWe were all affected in different ways. Every person in Altadena was affected at once, but everyone\u2019s stories are unique and different,\u201d co-producer and co-organizer Kevin Lyman, the creator of Warped Tour and longtime Altadena resident, tells TODAY.com. \u201c(We are) united under one tragedy.\u201d",
      "Approached by Dawes and guitarist Eric Krasno, Lyman teamed up with the two and began producing a show to support the community, raise funds and provide 250 tickets to Altadena residents directly impacted by the fire.",
      "The support was immediate. Everyone who helped with the production, Lyman says, were friends who became \u201cextended family.\u201d The participants also had ties to Altadena, Palisades or Los Angeles and were impacted by the fires.",
      "\u201cI think in Altadena now, we\u2019re all an extended family,\u201d Lyman says, before noting the similarities between rebuilding the town and producing a show for the community. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge undertaking that if you look at it as a whole, it\u2019s overwhelming... And all we want to do is bring people together.\u201d",
      "Hosted by actor and Altadena resident John C. Reilly, taking the stage during the over three-hour event was Taboo from Black Eyed Peas, who performed \u201cStand Strong,\u201d his song with his daughter Jett Gomez. Jenny Lewis, Ozomatli, Everclear, Aloe Blacc, Rufus Wainwright, Lord Huron, Judith Hill and Lucius were also part of the line up.",
      "Mandy Moore performed her early hit single \u201cCandy\u201d alongside husband Taylor Goldsmith, singer and guitarist of Dawes. The \u201cThis Is Us\u201d star and her family\u2019s home was impacted by the fire, with her in-laws and family losing their houses.",
      "Earlier in the day, Moore had expressed how grateful she was to give back to her town after so much \u201ctrauma and grief.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy heart is with everyone affected: the lives that were lost and the lives that were forever changed on both sides of our beautiful city,\u201d she wrote on Instagram, in part. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the chance to gather tonight and celebrate how resilient Altadena is; to be in community with one another and MUSIC to commemorate what we\u2019ve lived through and what comes next. I am endlessly grateful to those near and far who supported Los Angeles in our time of need. The work has only just begun but we\u2019re in it together. Altadena forever.\u201d",
      "Brad Paisley played guitar with several artists and performed his song with Dawes, \u201cRaining Inside.\u201d Brandon Flowers from The Killers also helped close out the show before Dawes concluded the event with all their friends.",
      "Speakers from Habitat For Humanity, as well as Altadena Girls, also participated in the event, expressing uplifting words and preaching \u201cAltadena Strong.\u201d Students from Pasadena Waldorf School, which is permanently closed after being damaged by the fire, attended, too.",
      "With rebuilding efforts slowly happening, and only about 10 homes rebuilt so far, according to The Associated Press, the event was able to raise more than $450,000 for the Altadena Builds Back Foundation. There is still an online auction happening through Feb. 21.",
      "\u201cI walk out of my house and I start hearing hammers and I hear saws and I hear trucks coming... (It\u2019s) the sound of rebuilding. That\u2019s how you build a song, one note at a time,\u201d Lyman tells TODAY.com. \u201cThen it becomes, hopefully, something people love \u2014 and that\u2019s what Altadena will become again. It\u2019s going to change... It never will be (the same), but that\u2019s OK.\u201d"

      "After \"High School Musical\" star Ashley Tisdale penned a scathing first-person essay for The Cut about her \"toxic\" mom group, celebrities have been responding. And they are not, in fact, all in this together.",
      "In her essay, Tisdale wrote how she was initially energized by joining a mom group of friends who happened to be having babies at the same time. Eventually, however, she began to feel left out.",
      "Though Tisdale didn\u2019t name names \u2014 and in fact her rep denied that certain celebrities were part of the clique \u2014 there has been a huge amount of internet speculation about the identity of the other moms in the group.",
      "Meghan Trainor, who has been pegged by internet sleuths as a potential member of Tisdale's former mom crew, shared what seemed like a response to the drama on TikTok on Jan. 8.",
      "The video features an expressionless Trainor typing on a keyboard. The text reads, \"Me finding out about the apparent mom group drama.\" Playing in the background is Trainor's song, \"Still Don't Care,\" highlighting these lyrics: \"Let me take a moment, think it over. Does it touch me at all? Nope, I still don\u2019t care.\"",
      "In her essay, Tisdale wrote, \u201cTo be clear, I have never considered the moms to be bad people. (Maybe one.) But I do think our group dynamic stopped being healthy and positive \u2014 for me, anyway.\u201d",
      "She texted the group that she was leaving because it was getting \u201ctoo high school\u201d for her.",
      "Tisdale, 40, who goes by her married name of Ashley French on her blog, is a mother of two who rose to fame as a child actor in the 2000s on the Disney Channel. Never one to hold back, Tisdale has been outspoken about her personal struggles with mental health, alopecia and breastfeeding.",
      "Responses have been rolling in from other celebrities.",
      "On Jan. 6, Matthew Koma, Hilary Duff's husband, posted a fictional image on his Instagram stories.",
      "The photo looks almost exactly like Tisdale's photo from The Cut: Koma is wearing an almost identical outfit, sitting on a similar-looking off-white couch and striking the same unique pose. The Cut's logo appears in the corner, and the text reads, \"A Mom Group Tell All Through a Father's Eyes: When You're the Most Self Obsessed Tone Deaf Person On Earth, Other Moms Tend To Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.\"",
      "He also included the text: \u201cRead my new interview with @thecut.\u201d",
      "Another Disney Channel star, Christy Carlson Romano, also shared her feelings about mom groups on Instagram on Jan. 6.",
      "Moms of older kids sometimes end up \"cycling out of those friendships, and that kind of sucks,\" Romano said. When the dynamic shifts, moms often find a new group of friends.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be dramatic, but I get it. Sometimes it gets a little crazy and then you write an article about it,\" Romano concludes with a pointed glance at the camera.",
      "Tisdale's husband, Christopher French, shared a cryptic  Instagram message in his stories: \"Underrated life skill: Pausing to decide if it's worth your energy.\" The image was originally posted by @heycoryallen.",
      "Will this mom group rift have an ending worthy of a Disney Channel original movie? Or will the division continue to play out on social media?",
      "As one commenter on Romano's reel wrote, \"These Disney Channel mom group wars were not on my bingo card for 2026.\""

    "story": [
      "Netflix\u2019s \"His & Hers\" opens like a familiar psychological whodunit but ends somewhere far more unsettling.",
      "The six-episode limited series, adapted from Alice Feeney\u2019s novel and created by William Oldroyd, stars Tessa Thompson as Anna Andrews, a once-prominent news reporter, opposite Jon Bernthal as Jack Harper, a small-town detective.",
      "Once married and now estranged, the two are pulled back into each other\u2019s lives when a woman is found murdered in the woods near their sleepy hometown of Dahlonega, Georgia.",
      "The victim is Rachel Hopkins (Jamie Tisdale), a former high-school friend of Anna\u2019s. Her death immediately raises questions, especially when it\u2019s revealed that Jack had been having an affair with Rachel the night before she was killed. As Anna pushes to cover the case as a field reporter and Jack leads the investigation, both find themselves under suspicion, locked in a tense game of truth-telling and omission.",
      "Then, more women from Anna\u2019s past turn up dead: Helen Wang (Poppy Liu) and Zoe (Marin Ireland), each murder marked with friendship bracelets from their teenage years.",
      "Te series frames its central question clearly: Who killed Rachel, and which woman finally snapped?",
      "What Happened to Rachel in High School?",
      "By the finale, the show makes clear it was never about who lost control. It was about who remembered the past and decided to act on it.",
      "That past begins on Anna\u2019s 16th birthday.",
      "Anna, Rachel, Zoe, and Helen were once a tight-knit high-school friend group, inseparable on the surface. That night, under the guise of a celebration, Rachel, the group\u2019s ringleader, lured Anna and an awkward outsider named Catherine Kelly (Astrid Rotenberry) into the woods.",
      "What began as teenage cruelty escalated into something far darker. Older men were brought in. Photos were taken. Catherine managed to escape. Anna didn\u2019t. She was sexually assaulted while the girls she trusted stood by and watched.",
      "The trauma was buried for years, and the girls never told anyone.",
      "Catherine, meanwhile, reinvents herself through massive weight loss and plastic surgery.",
      "Years later, she returns to town under a new name, Lexi Jones (Rebecca Rittenhouse), as a polished, ambitious news anchor who takes over Anna\u2019s job during her absence. Her reappearance ties the violence of the past directly to the present-day investigation, making her a natural suspect, even though she isn\u2019t responsible for the murders.",
      "Who Killed Rachel, Zoe and Helen?",
      "It isn\u2019t until decades later, after Anna loses her three-month-old daughter to sudden infant death syndrome, a tragedy that shatters her marriage and sends her into a year-long disappearance, that the truth fully resurfaces.",
      "While going through old tapes and mementos, Anna\u2019s mother, Mrs. Andrews, discovers footage from that night in the woods and realizes what really happened to her daughter.",
      "For a woman already grieving the loss of her granddaughter and watching her daughter fall apart, the discovery becomes a breaking point.",
      "The series ultimately reveals that Mrs. Andrews is the killer. She fakes dementia to move unnoticed and uses spare keys from her years working as a house cleaner to methodically kill Rachel, Helen, and Zoe, the women she believes destroyed Anna\u2019s life. Each murder is marked by a friendship bracelet, transforming symbols of teenage loyalty into reminders of betrayal.",
      "When Anna reads her mother\u2019s confession in the finale, her reaction is what makes the ending so chilling. She cries and then smiles. She doesn\u2019t turn her mother in. She doesn\u2019t confront her. She accepts what was had been done for her.",
      "Anna then makes her own choice. She never tells Jack the full truth about the woods and that she, not Catherine, had been sexually assaulted. She allows the safer version of the story to stand. And she raises Zoe\u2019s daughter, knowing her own mother killed Zoe, reframing the murder as a twisted attempt to give Anna back the family she lost.",
      "By the final moments, Anna has everything she once wanted: her career, a future, a family.",
      "But it\u2019s built on silence.",
      "\"His & Hers\" doesn\u2019t end by solving a crime. It ends by asking a far darker question, one that lingers long after the credits roll: If the truth only causes more pain, is it still worth telling, or is survival its own form of justice?"

      "The vast island \u2014 around the size of Alaska and California combined \u2014 is inhabited by only 57,000 people, about the same as Carson City, Nevada. Around 90% of them are Indigenous Inuit people whose ancestors arrived more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Denmark colonized Greenland 300 years ago and granted it the status of an autonomous territory in the 1970s, while retaining control of military and foreign policy.",
      "American designs on Greenland go back way further than Trump. In 1867, then-Secretary of State William H. Seward contemplated annexing Greenland, as well as Iceland, having recently bought Alaska from Russia.",
      "The United States briefly took control of Greenland during World War II to stop it from being used by the Nazis, and an agreement has existed since 1951 that allows the U.S. to \u201cconstruct, install, maintain, and operate\u201d military bases across the island.",
      "Greenland\u2019s sole U.S. military base was used as an early detection post for Soviet nuclear missiles during the Cold War, home to thousands of troops at its peak. Locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Pituffik base is now overseen by the U.S. Space Force and houses a much smaller number of troops.",
      "When Trump first said he wanted to buy Greenland in 2019, in what he described as a \u201creal estate deal,\u201d it was widely seen internationally as absurd.",
      "But after years of pressure from Trump, and the U.S. attack on Venezuela, few in Europe are laughing.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with the foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland next week for further discussions, as officials push for a deal.",
      "But the White House says that all options are on the table, including military action. An attack by NATO\u2019s most powerful member on an ally would most likely implode the alliance, which for decades has upheld the principle of collective defense.",
      "\u201cWe are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don\u2019t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we\u2019re not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow Russia or China to occupy Greenland, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if we don\u2019t own it,\u201d he said during the public portion of a meeting with oil and gas executives.",
      "European powers including Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement this week they \u201cwill not stop defending\u201d the principles of territorial integrity, but most experts agree with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller\u2019s blunt assessment that \u201cnobody\u2019s going to fight the U.S. over the future of Greenland.\u201d",
      "The European Union could impose sanctions on Washington, or limit its use of military bases in Europe, but both would be mutually painful in the extreme, said Mika Aaltola, a Finnish lawmaker who serves on the European Union\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "\u201cWe are basically in a trap that is difficult to resolve,\u201d Aaltola told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe thought that January would be about peace deals or a cease-fire in Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Europe to end that conflict. \u201cBut all of a sudden, we realized that Trump has manipulated us into a situation where he wants to have Greenland.\u201d",
      "Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran British lawmaker, said \u201cthe reality for Europe is they need to probably offer an alternative to the demand that Trump is making.\u201d",
      "There is bafflement alongside the dismay. Trump already has huge scope to build new military bases on Greenland or negotiate deals for its minerals, but he has refused to compromise on his demand for \u201cownership\u201d to be transferred.",
      "He said Friday: \u201cWhen we own it, we defend it. You don\u2019t defend leases the same way. You have to own it.\u201d",
      "Aside from being a good outpost from which to keep an eye on Russia, Greenland also forms one side of the \u201cGIUK gap\u201d (which stands for Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom), a naval choke point for submarines and other vessels in and out of the Atlantic.",
      "As the global ice sheet melts, new Arctic sea routes are emerging that Trump\u2019s team and other Western officials fear could be exploited by China and Russia.",
      "Beijing has certainly made moves in the region, declaring itself in 2019 to be a \u201cnear Arctic nation\u201d and outlining plans for a \u201cPolar silk road\u201d to mirror the infrastructure belt it has constructed on land.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to this motive Wednesday, saying U.S. ownership of Greenland was required \u201cto deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region,\u201d though she said there would be \u201cmany other benefits.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance cited Greenland\u2019s continued role in missile defense infrastructure in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, criticizing what he said was a lack of investment from Denmark and Europe that left it vulnerable to potential threats from \u201cthe Russians and the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t done a good job of securing that area, that land mass,\u201d he said.",
      "Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, said the country has recently invested $4 billion in Arctic security, including expanding the permanent presence of its armed forces.",
      "The retreating ice floes may also yield new opportunities to exploit its vast mineral reserves, a subject that has proven to be at the forefront of Trump\u2019s mind in negotiations over Ukraine and Venezuela.",
      "In 2023, the European Commission carried out a survey that found 25 of the 34 elements it classified as \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d were found on Greenland. These substances are crucial in producing everything from electric vehicle batteries to cutting-edge military hardware \u2014 vital currency in the global tech battle with China and others.",
      "Trump himself has denied minerals are a factor, positioning Greenland as a \u201cnational security\u201d issue, though some around him are eager to take advantage.",
      "\u201cThis is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources,\u201d then-congressman Mike Waltz, who would later become Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said last January.",
      "The reality is likely a mix of all these factors, according to William Alberque, former director of NATO\u2019s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre.",
      "\u201cGreenland is a toxic combination of issues in terms of this administration\u2019s interests,\u201d Alberque said. \u201cIt brings together the China hawks, the legitimate concerns about Atlantic security, the America Firsters and continental security, and let\u2019s not forget naked economic interests.\u201d"

      "This article is by F. Brinley Bruton reporting from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and a Caracas-based reporter who is not being identified because of safety concerns.",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Political reality is settling in for Venezuela as the regime once led by deposed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro tightens its hold on the country.",
      "Many Venezuelans opposed to Maduro\u2019s rule were overjoyed when U.S. special forces captured him over the weekend, believing this would be quickly followed by a transition to a form of a new government. But for some, these hopes have dimmed in recent days.",
      "No political prisoners appear to have been released, and the government is cracking down on any new signs of dissent, arresting people they said celebrated Maduro\u2019s capture by the United States military. The country\u2019s security and intelligence apparatus is out in force, with masked paramilitary \u201ccolectivos\u201d \u2014 armed civilians who support the government \u2014 roaming the streets on motorcycles, and military intelligence agents in civilian clothes circulating in vans with an official insignia and setting up roadblocks. The entire top leadership remains intact, with the notable exception of Maduro himself.",
      "The lack of change in government was underlined by a recent classified intelligence assessment that determined that top members of the Maduro regime \u2014 including former Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday \u2014 were best positioned to lead Venezuela\u2019s government and maintain stability.",
      "That assessment factored in President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of Maria Corina Machado, the exiled opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, as the best person to take over running the country, sources told NBC News.",
      "These developments were a gut-punch for Michelle, a resident of Caracas.",
      "\u201cFor many years I wished for my country\u2019s government to change, and I thought that when that day came I would feel very happy. But that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said the 34-year-old architect, who moved back to Venezuela last year. \u201cSomehow we will have to pay: either with oil or with our own dignity and sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Michelle and others who spoke to NBC News in Venezuela asked not to be fully identified out of fear the government would punish them.",
      "\u201cA dangerous precedent is being created between the United States and Latin America,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cWe realize that we are just another piece on the board in the struggle between powers, for whom the future of the Venezuelan people lacks relevance compared to the importance of valuable resources, which are worth more than life itself.\u201d",

On Tuesday he said Venezuela would \u201cbe turning over\u201d up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., adding that the revenue from the oil will be used to benefit both Americans and Venezuelans.",
      "But pessimism about recent events in Venezuela isn\u2019t shared by all opposition supporters, including former political prisoner Luis Mata.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like eating a pizza \u2014 they go slice by slice. We have to trust the process,\u201d the political activist and human rights defender living in exile told NBC News. Confusion surrounds the fate of the 800 to 900 political prisoners who remain incarcerated after the presidential elections on July 28, 2024.",
      "Mata, 26, was one of the thousands of volunteers who safeguarded vote tallies during the 2024 vote. The Maduro government overturned what independent election observers, rights groups and foreign governments said was a resounding opposition victory.",
      "Days after the election, Mata was detained by police officers as he tried to leave the city where he lived after hearing the government was looking for people who safeguarded the votes. He was charged with seven crimes and spent four months imprisoned in Tocor\u00f3n jail. He is now outside Venezuela.",
      "\u201cMany say the United States wants to seize the oil, but the United States is a trade ally. The United States supports freedom in Venezuela,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor me, change is closer than ever. Nicol\u00e1s is out of the country and will never set foot in Venezuela again,\u201d added Mata, who asked that NBC News not reveal his location out of security reasons. \u201cFreedom is about to arrive.\u201d",
      "Whether or not \u201cfreedom\u201d is about to sweep across Venezuela, the old regime is intent on projecting continuity. A striking symbol of this was when Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as president and the country\u2019s leadership marched shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the National Assembly on Monday.",

Also surrounding her are seen minister of defense Vladimir Padrino, in full formal military uniform, and a smiling Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Guerra, the son of the ousted leader.",
      "The image runs counter to repeated statements by Trump asserting that the U.S. is \u201cin charge\u201d in Venezuela.",

      "Marlenis, a domestic worker in Caracas, doesn\u2019t seem too worried about Trump\u2019s plans for Venezuela. She says that after 25 years of a system that has made her poorer every day, Venezuelans have nothing to lose by trying something different.",
      "\u201cWhat else can we lose?\u201d she said, while waiting for the bus to go home after work. \u201cIf everything goes badly, people are already used to bad things.\u201d"

    "summary": "The United Kingdom\u2019s online safety regulator announced Monday it was formally investigating X.",
    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom\u2019s online safety regulator announced Monday it was formally investigating X over concerns that Grok had been \u201cused to create and share undressed images of people,\u201d including children.",
      "The agency, Ofcom, said it was carrying out an \u201cexpedited assessment\u201d and that X had responded to its requests for information on Friday. If Ofcom finds that X violated U.K. law, it can institute penalties ranging from sanctions of 10% of its global revenue, prohibiting British companies from advertising with X, or directing the country\u2019s internet providers to block the platform.",
      "The U.K. investigation is just one of the actions taken by governments around the world in response to Grok\u2019s deepfake abilities.",
      "Over the weekend, regulators in Indonesia and Malaysia announced they had temporarily blocked X in their countries, citing their laws against deepfakes and child sexual abuse material (CSAM).",
      "Mary Anne Franks, a George Washington University law professor who studies laws on nonconsensual pornography and has helped both state and federal legislators craft laws on the topic, said she does not expect the U.S. federal government to step in. But threats from other countries with stricter CSAM laws may force X and Musk to rein Grok in, she said.",
      "\u201cIf there is some slowdown, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because of the backlash, and then separately, because these other countries have different definitions of what constitutes illegal CSAM,\u201d Franks said.",
      "Last week, after being prompted by users, Grok began creating thousands of sexualized AI-generated images every hour using the faces of real people and posting them on X, according to an analysis conducted by deepfake researcher Genevieve Oh. Many of the deepfakes depicted identifiable women who were placed in bathing suits or revealing poses by artificial intelligence; but Grok also depicted some people, including some children, according to some watchdogs, as fully nude.",
      "A spokesperson for the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, told NBC News that the agency has recently observed Grok generating sexualized images of children.",
      "On Friday, Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, a government agency dedicated to online safety, said it had received several reports of Grok creating exploitative images and had asked X to clarify its safeguards, noting that it could issue removal notices to X. Both Australia\u2019s Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, condemned the images on Saturday.",
      "Musk and X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk and X recently posted that they prohibit users from making \u201cillegal content,\u201d but have refrained from publicly indicating that they would substantially change Grok\u2019s ability to manipulate and sexualize images of people. The creation and possession of CSAM are widely illegal around the world, but many countries also have laws restricting or prohibiting the creation of sexualized images of adult people without their consent, known as nonconsensual pornography.",
      "Early Friday, X made the Grok reply bot, which was driving the deepfake trend, a premium feature for paying subscribers, though users could still produce the deepfakes using the Grok stand-alone app in addition to other interfaces where Grok was available. While the number of such images posted to X appears to have slowed, critics like Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., have said the move is tantamount to making \u201csome of its users pay for the privilege of producing horrific images on the X app.\u201d",
      "Ofcom said its investigation would focus on whether X has been following U.K. law by quickly taking down illegal content as it became aware of it, and whether it was carrying out successful risk assessments before making \u201csignificant changes to their service.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a radio interview that Ofcom \u201chas our full support to take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is disgraceful. It\u2019s disgusting. And it\u2019s not to be tolerated,\u201d he said of the image creation. \u201cX has got to get a grip of this.\u201d",
      "India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, MeitY, also reportedly warned X last week that it was potentially violating its laws. MeitY didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "It remains unclear if any U.S. regulators will take on Musk and his companies over the manipulated images. The Federal Trade Commission did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department told NBC News last week that it was committed to holding \u201cindividuals who exploit technology to harm our most vulnerable\u201d accountable but didn\u2019t mention specific companies.",
      "A number of state attorneys general have declined to comment to NBC News on whether they are considering charges over the images.",
      "Musk has broadly pushed for X and his AI company that powers Grok, xAI, to be laxer on content moderation than most of their competitors. On Friday, he posted on X that reports of the U.K.\u2019s Labour Party wanting to potentially block X over the Grok images were evidence that \u201cThey want any excuse for censorship.\u201d",
      "Thomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said at a news conference Monday that it has given Musk and X an ultimatum to stop the production of CSAM, but stopped short of mentioning any specific penalties.",
      "\u201cDrawing a parallel between freedom of speech and an AI tool that generates child sexual abuse material is dangerous nonsense, especially when it comes from the owner of a tech company. Frankly speaking I cannot even believe we are speaking about this and engaging with this from the commission\u2019s podium in 2026,\u201d Regnier said.",
      "In December, the European Commission fined X $140 million, saying that the platform broke Europe\u2019s laws against hate speech and misinformation. That prompted criticism from the Trump administration, with both Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling it an attack on American free speech."

      "In another post on Friday, Trump said he was looking forward to meeting Petro at the White House in February, adding: \u201cI am sure it will work out very well for Colombia, and the U.S.A., but, cocaine and other drugs must be STOPPED from coming into the United States.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about the flurry of calls that preceded the conversation between the two leaders, nor about Trump\u2019s comment to Petro that they both were \u201csurrounded by lies.\u201d",
      "Colombian leaders, including Petro and S\u00e1nchez, appeared  gratified by the language Trump used when describing the conversation."

      "After Trump\u2019s repeated threats to intervene, Khamenei said the president should focus on problems in his own country.",
      "The brief speech was aired on state television after the most intense night yet in the wave of unrest, which began in protest at the country's ailing economy but has grown into a broader challenge to the ruling clerical regime.",

Dozens have already been killed in a violent crackdown by security forces.",

      "Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said Friday in a statement reported by Iran's hard-line Student News Network  that \"protecting the achievements of the Islamic Revolution\" is a \"red line,\" while acknowledging \"the livelihood and professional concerns of the people\" and \"any potential negligence.\"",

Analysts have questioned the weapon's utility, and its deployment  appeared to be the Kremlin's latest attempt to send a threatening message to Kyiv and the West with peace talks stalled.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said early Friday that it had carried out the \u201cmassive strike\u201d against critically important targets in response to an alleged Ukrainian drone strike late last year on a residence used by President Vladimir Putin.",

      "\u201cAny terrorist actions by the criminal Ukrainian regime will continue to be met with a response,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "In addition to the Oreshnik medium-range ballistic missile, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the nationwide attack involved nearly 250 drones and dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles. At least four people, including a paramedic, died in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said in a post on X.",
