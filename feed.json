      "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
      "Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt,\u201d Simon said in a statement. \u201cShe and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\u201d",
      "No court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitt's attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood\u2019s most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019 declared them divorced and single, but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.",
      "A private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.",
      "No details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couple's use of the private judge \u2014 an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years \u2014 has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit."

      "Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas. But, nearly two months after its release, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a film about a family torn apart by the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades, has drawn millions of moviegoers across the South American country.",
      "The film's domestic box office success \u2014 with nearly 3 million tickets sold, it secured the fifth spot at the 2024 box office by mid December \u2014 is rooted in its exploration of a long-neglected national trauma, but it is particularly timely, especially as Brazil confronts a recent near-miss with democratic rupture.",
      "Set in the 1970s and based on true events, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d tells the story of the Paivas, an upper-class family in Rio de Janeiro shattered by the dictatorship. Rubens Paiva, a former leftist congressman, was taken into custody by the military in 1971 and was never seen again. The narrative centers on his wife, Eunice Paiva, and her lifelong pursuit of justice.",
      "The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for best foreign language film and shortlisted for the Oscars in the same category.",
      "\u201cComedies and other topics are more likely to become mega-successes, but this (the dictatorship) is a very taboo subject for us,\u201d said Brazilian psychoanalyst and writer Vera Iaconelli, adding that she felt a \u201csense of urgency\u201d after watching the movie last month, even though the dictatorship ended almost four decades ago.",
      "As the movie was being shown across Brazil, the Federal Police unsealed a report detailing a 2022 plot by military officers to stage a coup to prevent President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from taking office, and to keep far-right former army captain Jair Bolsonaro in power. Bolsonaro and his allies have denied any involvement in participating or inciting a coup.",
      "\u201cEven if (director) Walter Salles wanted to plan the timing of the release this precisely, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten it so right,\u201d said Lucas Pedretti, a historian and sociologist whose works address memory and reparations after the military dictatorship.",
      "\u201cThe film plays a very important role in telling us: \u2018Look, this is what would happen if the coup that was planned by Bolsonaro and his military officers had succeeded.\u2019\u201d",
      "Unlike countries like Argentina and Chile, which established truth commissions and prosecuted former dictators and their henchmen, Brazil's transition back to democracy was marked by a sweeping amnesty to military officials.",
      "For years, said Pedretti, Brazil\u2019s military promoted the notion that government silence was the best way to bury the past.",
      "It was not until 2011 that Brazil\u2019s then- President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses.",
      "The commission's 2014 report detailed harrowing accounts of torture and named perpetrators of human rights violations \u2014 none were ever imprisoned. But just as a reckoning of the dictatorship began, calls for a return to military rule emerged in street protests against corruption revelations.",
      "It was then that Marcelo Rubens Paiva, one of Rubens' sons, decided to share his family's story in his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here.\" The book introduced Eunice Paiva to a larger audience, chronicling her journey from a housewife to a relentless advocate for her disappeared husband, and how she raised five children by herself, while also pursuing a law degree.",
      "In the years that followed, far-right, anti-establishment forces increasingly gained traction. Bolsonaro \u2014 who has long celebrated the coup and praised dictatorship-era torturers \u2014 would go on to ride that wave to a presidential victory in 2018.",
      "Observing the surge of the far-right in Brazil, filmmaker Salles realized the country's memory of its dictatorship was very fragile. He said he saw a need for his country to confront its trauma in order to prevent history from repeating itself.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d isn\u2019t the first Brazilian movie to explore the memory of the dictatorship, but it is the most popular. Unlike other films on the subject that tend to focus on dissidents and armed resistance, Salles chose to frame his as a family drama and how the disappearance of the family patriarch upended their day-to-day lives.",
      "Its climax \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 arrives 25 years after Rubens\u2019 disappearance, when Eunice finally receives his death certificate.",
      "In December, a month after the film\u2019s premiere, the Brazilian government allowed families of dictatorship-era victims to obtain reissued death certificates acknowledging state-sponsored killings.",
      "\"It is very symbolic that this is happening amid the international repercussion of \u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019 ... so younger people can understand a bit of what that period was like,\u201d Brazil's Human Rights Minister Maca\u00e9 Evaristo said during the announcement, calling it an important step in the \u201chealing process for Brazilian society.\u201d",
      "The healing process remains incomplete, as some forces \u2014 once again \u2014 seek to prevent those who allegedly sought to sabotage democracy from being held to account.",
      "On Nov. 29, Bolsonaro urged Lula and the Supreme Court to grant amnesty for those involved in the 2022 alleged coup plot and, alongside his allies, pushed for legislation to pardon participants in the 2023 anti-democratic riot that aimed to oust Lula and marked an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe coup is still here. It\u2019s still in people\u2019s minds, it\u2019s still in the minds of the military,\u201d said Paulo Sergio Almeida, a filmmaker and founder of Filme B, a company that tracks Brazil's national cinema. \u201cWe thought this was a thing of the past, but it\u2019s not. The past is still present in Brazil.\u201d",
      "This time around, many Brazilians are calling for the prosecution of those responsible for the attempted coup, believing that justice is essential for national reconciliation and future progress.",
      "On Dec. 14, police arrested Bolsonaro's 2022 running mate and former defense minister in connection with investigations into the alleged coup plot, becoming the first four-star general arrested by civilians since the end of the dictatorship in 1985.",
      "\u201cIt's a sign that we are making progress as a constitutional democracy,\u201d leftist Sen. Randolfe Rodrigues wrote on X that day. \u201cBrazil still has a long way to go as a Republic, but today is a HISTORIC day on this journey.\u201d",
      "Brazilians have also embraced the \u201cNo amnesty!\" rallying cry, which originated at street protests in the aftermath of the capital's 2023 riot and can still be heard.",
      "Earlier this month, a Supreme Court justice cited \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d while arguing that the 1979 amnesty law shouldn\u2019t apply to the crime of concealing bodies.",
      "\u201cThe disappearance of Rubens Paiva, whose body was never found or buried, highlights the enduring pain of thousands of families,\u201d Justice Fl\u00e1vio Dino said.",
      "Striking a chord in Brazil was precisely Marcelo Rubens Paiva's intent when adapting his book into a film.",
      "\u201cThe movie is sparking this debate, and it arrived at the right moment for people to recognize that living under a dictatorship is no longer acceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent evening in Sao Paulo, 46-year-old Juliana Patr\u00edcia and her 16-year-old daughter, Ana J\u00falia, left a movie theater in tears, touched by \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw all the suffering that Eunice endured, with Rubens being killed and taken from his family in such a brutal way,\u201d Patr\u00edcia said. \u201cIt made us even more certain that democracy needs to be respected and that, as Brazilians, we must fight harder to ensure that this never happens in our country again.\u201d",

      "Charles Shyer, the Oscar-nominated writer and filmmaker known for classic comedies like \u201cPrivate Benjamin,\u201d \u201cBaby Boom\u201d and \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d that he made alongside Nancy Meyers, has died. He was 83.",
      "Shyer died in Los Angeles on Friday, his daughter, filmmaker Hallie Meyers-Shyer told The Associated Press on Sunday. No cause was disclosed.",
      "A son of Hollywood, whose father Melville Shyer was one of the founding members of the Directors Guild of America, Shyer made an indelible mark on comedies, mostly of the romantic persuasion, in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "Born in Los Angeles in 1941, Shyer cut his teeth writing for television, assisting Garry Marshall and working on shows like \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d before transitioning to films. He had writing credits on \u201cSmokey and the Bandit,\u201d Jack Nicholson\u2019s \u201cGoin\u2019 South\u201d and the Walter Matthau drama \u201cHouse Calls.\u201d A big breakthrough came with \u201cPrivate Benjamin,\u201d the Goldie Hawn comedy about a wealthy woman who inadvertently signs up for basic training, which he co-wrote with Meyers and Harvey Miller.",
      "It was a script that was initially turned down by every studio in Hollywood, even with Hawn attached to star and produce.",
      "\u201cWe went to a meeting at Paramount after they read the script, and Mike Eisner was the president of the studio, and we sat in his office with Mike and (producer) Don Simpson. And Mike said to Goldie, \u2018This is a mistake for you to make this movie,\u2019\u201d Shyer told Indiewire in 2022. \u201cGod bless Don Simpson who spoke up and said, \u2018Mike, you\u2019re 100% wrong on this one.\u2019\u201d",
      "The movie became one of the biggest hits of 1980. It got them an Oscar nomination and a win from the Writers Guild and also paved the way for his directorial debut \u201cIrreconcilable Differences.\u201d",
      "That film, which he also wrote with Meyers (they married in 1980), starred Shelley Long and Ryan O\u2019Neal as a writing-directing duo whose relationship crumbles after success and an infatuation with a young actor played by Sharon Stone. It was partially inspired by the tabloid affairs of Peter Bogdanovich, who left his wife and producer Polly Platt for Cybill Shepherd.",
      "\u201cNancy and I just laughed at the same things. We love the same movies, we kind of educate each other on the movies that each of us loved,\u201d Shyer told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAnd Nancy really made me laugh. I think she wrote the best one-liners of anybody I know, except Neil Simon. And, and we were just always in sync \u2014 as filmmakers, we had this thing.\u201d",
      "They followed with \u201cBaby Boom,\u201d in which Diane Keaton plays a working woman who suddenly has to care for a baby, and \u201cFather of the Bride,\u201d which reimagined Vincente Minnelli\u2019s 1950 film for the 1990s with Keaton, Steve Martin and Martin Short leading the comedic ensemble. It was successful enough to spawn a sequel.",
      "Shyer and Meyers' last collaboration as a married couple before divorcing in 1999 was the remake of \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d with Lindsay Lohan, which Meyers directed and Shyer co-wrote and produced. Their daughters Annie and Hallie, whose names were used for Lohan\u2019s twin characters, both appeared in the film. Shyer is also survived by two children, Jacob and Sophia, from a subsequent marriage that ended in divorce.",
      "While Shyer often found himself doing remakes, he and Meyers never wanted to do \u201ccarbon copies\u201d of the originals and always endeavored to put their own stamp on their films. But even he was surprised by the longevity of some of them, remembering an old Billy Wilder quote that \u201ccomedy is not like fine wine, it does not age well.\u201d But, he said, they tried to avoid the temptation to include too many timely references.",
      "\u201cYou try to write things that are not basically of the moment, especially in comedy,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cTry to write stories about human beings that will reflect on today and tomorrow and yesterday.\u201d",
      "Shyer went on to remake \u201cAlfie,\u201d with Jude Law, and the Hilary Swank period drama \u201cThe Affair of the Necklace,\u201d neither of which did well at the box office. He also directed the Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte movie \u201cI Love Trouble,\u201d the only film of his that he admitted he didn't like.",
      "Other films never saw the light of day: He spent a year and a half prepping \u201cEloise in Paris\u201d but it was canceled when the production company suddenly went out of business.",
      "He stepped away from directing for many years but returned in recent years with two Netflix Christmas romantic comedies: \u201cThe Noel Diary\u201d and \u201cBest. Christmas. Ever!\u201d",
      "\u201cI just gravitated towards stuff I like,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a James Bond movie. I\u2019ve never seen one. I never liked science-fiction movies. \u2026 I like movies about people, and I want them to have substance.\u201d",
      "Shyer had told Indiewire that he was working on a script he'd been thinking about for decades, since he was hospitalized briefly at 17. He described the movie as a cross between \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d and \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d And retirement, he said at the time, was not in the cards.",
      "\u201cWhat am I going to do? Garden?\u201d he said. \u201cI just have a lot of energy. I want to keep going. I actually love the process and I love the camaraderie. I love what I do. If I drop dead, maybe it will be holding a camera.\u201d"

      "Two family films dominated the holiday box office this week, with \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d winning the three-day weekend over \u201cMufasa\u201d by a blue hair.",
      "Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while \u201cMufasa\u201d brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s \u201cMufasa\u201d had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million.",
      "It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively.",
      "The vampire horror \u201cNosferatu\u201d also debuted fairly triumphantly. Robert Eggers\u2019 modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; the erotic drama \u201cBabygirl\u201d with Nicole Kidman; and \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d about boxer Claressa Shields.",
      "\u201cNosferatu\u201d landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting \u201cThe Faculty's\u201d $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters.",
      "The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race.",
      "\u201cBabygirl,\u201d an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "\u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend showings where it played in 2006 theaters.",
      "Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe.

On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home.

      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Snoop Dogg climbed to top step of the bandstand and raised his arms, setting off a roar from the crowd. The marching bands fired up a version of \u201cWho Am I,\" the celebrity drum major grooving to the beat of his own tune.",
      "Forget your mayo baths, edible Pop-Tarts or even a national championship.",
      "Bowls don't get much better than Snoop Dogg directing the halftime show of the game bearing his name.",
      "\u201cWhat an amazing experience,\u201d Miami of Ohio coach Chuck Martin said.",
      "Snoop Dogg has seemed to become omnipresent the past few years through a massive entertainment empire.",
      "He's a rapper first, but also a movie and TV actor, video game character, pitchman, record company owner, vintner and Gin & Juice salesman.",
      "Snoop Dogg also has been involved in football for years; as a youth coach, guest analyst, with his own Snoop League for inner city youth in Southern California. He followed Jimmy Kimmel and Rob Gronkowski into the celebrity bowl sponsorship arena and, true to his brand, created quite a spectacle \u2014 along with NIL opportunities for the players \u2014 at the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop.",

      "Once game day rolled around, it seemed to be all Snoop all the time.",
      "Snoop Dogg caught a few passes from Miami\u2019s equipment manager during warmups and stopped by a tailgate outside for a few sips of gin & juice. He generated a huge roar walking out of the tunnel for the coin toss, decked out in a green-and-gold Arizona Bowl sweatsuit, sunglasses, gray Snoop Dogg sneakers, a black Gin & Juice hat and, of course, a bit of bling draped around his neck.",
      "Snoop Dogg shook hands with captains from both sides, flipped the coin \u2014 with a little flair - and posed for a photo with two of the officials before jogging to Colorado State\u2019s sideline, where he donned a headset to do a little play calling.",
      "Between quarters, Snoop Dogg tried to fire the T-shirt cannon \u2014 the shirts only flew a few feet so he waved it off \u2014 and stopped by to bop his head to a circle of Native American performers before heading up to the booth to join the TV broadcast.",
      "\u201cThis is a seven-day-a-week thing with me, man,\u201d Snoop Dogg said during the broadcast. \u201cI guess I\u2019m the people\u2019s champ because I love the people as much as they love me.\u201d",

      "NEW HOPE, Pa. -- Dayle Haddon, an actor, activist and trailblazing former \u201cSports Illustrated\u201d model who pushed back against age discrimination by reentering the industry as a widow, has died in a Pennsylvania home from what authorities believe was carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "Authorities in Bucks County found Haddon, 76, dead in a second-floor bedroom Friday morning after emergency dispatchers were notified about a person unconscious at the Solebury Township home. A 76-year-old man police later identified as Walter J. Blucas of Erie was hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "Responders detected a high level of carbon monoxide in the property and township police said Saturday that investigators determined that \u201ca faulty flue and exhaust pipe on a gas heating system caused the carbon monoxide leak.\u201d Two medics were taken to a hospital for carbon monoxide exposure and a police officer was treated at the scene.",
      "As a model, Haddon appeared on the covers of Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Elle and Esquire in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1973 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. She also appeared in about two dozen films from the 1970s to 1990s, according to IMDb.com, including 1994\u2019s \u201cBullets Over Broadway,\u201d starring John Cusack.",
      "Haddon left modeling after giving birth to her daughter, Ryan, in the mid-1970s, but then had to reenter the workforce after her husband's 1991 death. This time she found the modeling industry far less friendly: \u201cThey said to me, \u2018At 38, you\u2019re not viable,\u2019\u201d Haddon told The New York Times in 2003.",
      "Working a menial job at an advertising agency, Haddon began reaching out to cosmetic companies, telling them there was a growing market to sell beauty products to aging baby boomers. She eventually landed a contract with Clairol, followed by Est\u00e9e Lauder and then L\u2019Oreal, for which she promoted the company's anti-aging products for more than a decade. She also hosted beauty segments for CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Early Show.\u201d",
      "\"I kept modeling, but in a different way,\" she told The Times, \u201cI became a spokesperson for my age.\u201d",
      "In 2008, Haddon founded WomenOne, an organization aimed at advancing educational opportunities for girls and women in marginalized communities, including Rwanda, Haiti and Jordan.'",
      "Haddon was born in Toronto and began modeling as a teenager to pay for ballet classes \u2014 she began her career with the Canadian ballet company Les Grands Ballet Canadiens, according to her website.",
      "Haddon's daughter, Ryan, said in a social media post that her mother was \u201ceveryone\u2019s greatest champion. An inspiration to many.\u201d",
      "\u201cA pure heart. A rich inner life. Touching so many lives. A life well lived. Rest in Light, Mom,\u201d she said."

      "NEW YORK -- If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone.",
      "A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",
      "Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do anything too crazy for New Year\u2019s, usually. So this is definitely a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.\u201d",
      "Woods will be working New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.",
      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

They alleged they were filmed in the nude without their knowledge.",

      "Longtime CBS sportscaster Greg Gumbel has died from cancer",
      "Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster who broke barriers during his career calling some of the biggest sporting events, has died from cancer, according to a statement from his family released by the network on Friday. He was 78.",
      "\u201cHe leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,\u201d wife Marcy Gumbel and daughter Michelle Gumbel said in a statement.",
      "In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 due to what he said at the time were family health issues.",
      "Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties.",
      "In 2001, he announced Super Bowl 35 for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship.",
      "David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as someone who broke barriers and set standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness.",
      "\u201cA tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,\" Berson said.",
      "Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998.",
      "Sean McManus said of all the moves he made in his nearly 27 1/2 years leading CBS Sports, one of his proudest was bringing Gumbel back.",
      "\u201cNot only did he elevate our NFL and NCAA coverage to a new level, but his kindness, generosity, sense of humor and unselfishness were second to none. When he was around, he made everyone from the researchers to the technicians to the executives feel like he was their best friend,\u201d said McManus, who retired as CBS Sports chairman in April. \u201cHis love for his family was always the foundation of his life. There will never be another Greg Gumbel, and our industry and this world is a sadder place without him.\u201d",
      "Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. In 1995, he hosted the world figure skating championships and the following year hosted NBC\u2019s daytime coverage of the Atlanta Summer Olympics.",
      "But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 NFL studio show, \u201cThe NFL Today,\u201d from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004-05.",
      "Earlier this year, Gumbel recalled replacing Brent Musburger as host of \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d in 1990, describing it as intimidating and daunting.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I got to sit in the same chair and do the same thing or try to do the same thing that he did was an incredible honor,\" he said.",
      "Gumbel also called NFL games as the network\u2019s lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003, including Super Bowl 35 and 38. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season.",
      "\u201cLike all who knew and loved him, I too am saddened by his death, yet also so very grateful to have known him in my life,\u201d Clark Kellogg, a CBS Sports college basketball game and studio analyst, said in a statement. \u201cWhat a gift to be touched by such a good man and partner.\u201d",
      "Gumbel was the older brother of Bryant Gumbel, the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d on HBO. Bryant Gumbel received a lifetime achievement award at the Sports Emmys in 2003.",
      "Greg Gumbel grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1967 with a degree in English. He had plans to become an English teacher, but after his brother got into sportscasting, he auditioned at WMAQ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Chicago in 1973, according to the book \"You Are Looking Live!: How The NFL Today Revolutionized Sports Broadcasting.\" He was soon offered a position as weekend sports anchor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised I got the job. I certainly wasn\u2019t anyone who was polished,\" he said in the book. \u201cBy my own reckoning, it took me a good year to start to feel comfortable in front of a camera.\u201d",
      "Gumbel also worked for ESPN and the Madison Square Garden network.",
      "James Brown, who currently hosts \u201cThe NFL Today,\" described Gumbel on Friday as \u201cMr. Versatility and also very telegenic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was my pleasure to call him a friend and one who could do anything that was given to him in the wake of an assignment,\u201d he added.",
      "Gumbel won local Emmy Awards during his long career and was the recipient of the 2007 Pat Summerall Award for excellence in sports broadcasting.",
      "Outside of his broadcast career, he was affiliated with the March of Dimes for three decades, including as a member of its board of trustees. He also was a member of the Sports Council for St Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital for 16 years.",

      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Snoop Dogg has nearly as many ties to football as he does to rap music.",
      "The entertainer coached youth football for years and created the Snoop League, an after-school program for inner city Los Angeles youths. Snoop has been a guest analyst on football broadcasts and his son, Cordell Broadus, played Division I football.",
      "When Snoop took his latest step, becoming the sponsor of a bowl game, he had a demand: Find a way for all players in the game to receive name, image and likeness (NIL) money.",
      "\u201cThis was Snoop's idea,\u201d said Kym Adair, executive director of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice. \u201cHe was having conversations with people he knows in the college football world and I got a call that said he wants us to be the first bowl to make this commitment and that's what we did.\u201d",
      "The beneficiaries are Colorado State and Miami (Ohio), who will conclude their seasons Saturday at Arizona Stadium in the Arizona Bowl. The bowl is classified as a 501(c)(3), so all revenue goes to charity. And, being one of the few bowls not tied to ESPN, it opens the door for unique sponsorship opportunities.",
      "The bowl was previously sponsored by Barstool Sports and the digital media company used its own cast of characters on the broadcast, which was streamed on its digital platforms.",
      "Snoop Dogg takes over this year. The rapper/entertainer is the latest celebrity to sponsor a bowl, following the footsteps of Jimmy Kimmel and Rob Gronkowski at the LA Bowl.",
      "And, Snoop being Snoop, he wanted to put his own spin on his own bowl.",
      "\u201cCollege football fans are exhausted by the constant talk around NIL, conference realignment, coach movement, transfer portal and super conferences,\u201d Snoop said in a video posted on social media. \u201cSo it\u2019s time that we get back to the roots of college football \u2014 when it was focused on the colleges, the players and the competition, the community, the fan experience and the pageantry.\u201d",
      "With that will be an NIL component.",
      "The bowl can't pay players just for playing in the bowl, but both teams participated in football clinics on Friday and will get paid for their services. Other bowls have given single players NIL opportunities, but this is believed to be the first to offer it to every player on both teams.",
      "\u201cI love the fact that the Arizona Bowl is unique and tries new things, and obviously having Snoop here is unique,\u201d Colorado State coach Jay Norvell said. \u201cThe NIL component, it\u2019s the future. It\u2019s what football has become now. We think it\u2019s fantastic for our kids and then the interaction with the kids is the hidden gem of the whole thing.\u201d",
      "The NIL component of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl comes a month after a similar effort in The Players Era Festival basketball tournament in Las Vegas. The eight-team tournament said it paid out $9 million in NIL money to participating players for activities outside the competition. It also offered $50 million in NIL opportunities over the next three years for services and activities compliant with NCAA regulations.",
      "Are the Players Era Festival and Arizona Bowl the start of a new future? It is not out of the question in big-time college athletics, where schools are already preparing for the era of revenue sharing with players next year.",
      "\u201cRevenue sharing between the players and the athletic departments is already on the horizon, so whether that takes the place of these types of arrangements or they're completely separate has yet to be determined,\" Adair said. \"We're just trying to be flexible, ahead of the curve and make an impact any way we can.\u201d",
      "Just the way Snoop wants it.",

      "The former Morrison Hotel, which was famously on the cover of a 1970 album by The Doors, has been significantly damaged by a fire in downtown Los Angeles",
      "The former Morrison Hotel, made famous by The Doors and their 1970 album of the same name, was significantly damaged by a fire that erupted in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday.",
      "The four-story building, which has been vacant more than a decade, burned for nearly two hours before more than 100 firefighters brought the flames under control, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.",
      "The Morrison Hotel was featured on the cover of The Doors' fifth album. Celebrated music photographer Henry Diltz made the image in 1969 and said years later that it took a little trickery to pull it off.",
      "A hotel clerk told the band they weren't allowed to take photos inside, but when the clerk stepped away, the group ran into the lobby and Diltz quickly got the photo looking through the window, with legendary frontman Jim Morrison in the middle.",
      "\u201cIt was a great old wooden building with many small rooms upstairs where transients and drinkers could sleep it off on a cot for $2.50 a night!\" Diltz told The Associated Press on Friday. \"I think the beautiful front window with \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d in red letters was the best part of it! So did The Doors!\u201d",
      "The album was viewed as a comeback to their roots for The Doors, coming on the heels of Morrison's on-stage arrest at a Miami concert that saw him convicted of indecent exposure and profanity.",
      "Morrison and The Doors would release one final album, \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d before he was found dead in a Paris bathtub on July 3, 1971.",
      "Los Angeles firefighters who first arrived at the blaze on Thursday found heavy flames on the building's top floor.",
      "Several people who were in the building escaped without injuries, including three people rescued by firefighters from the third floor, according to the department. The building\u2019s roof collapsed, leaving its structural integrity in doubt, the department said.",
      "The building in recent years had been used as a training site for firefighters."

      "As season two of Netflix's hit series \u201cSquid Game\u201d returns Thursday, viewers can expect more untimely deaths for many of its characters",
      "Viewers may gasp, cringe or cry out watching characters die on Netflix's \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but those simulated deaths have a different effect on its creator, writer and director. Instead, Hwang Dong-hyuk feels happiness seeing them go.",
      "The show has a huge cast and Hwang says it was \u201creally difficult\u201d to manage everyone on set.",
      "As characters would die, Hwang recalls saying to the actors on their last day, \u201c\u2018Oh no! How sad! I won\u2019t see you tomorrow,' but I was always smiling inside.\u201d",
      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d season two premieres Thursday. It once again stars Lee Jung-jae and centers around a secret competition in South Korea that targets people in debt and the winner gets a big cash prize. What they don't know is that losing the game is deadly.",
      "Hwang originally conceived of the show 15 years ago as a two-hour film but it failed to gain traction with financiers or even interested actors. He put it aside and worked on other films instead. He then had the idea to make it a TV series instead and took the project to Netflix. There, it could reach a wide audience.",
      "\u201cI never in my wildest dream thought it was going to be this huge,\u201d said Hwang, who spoke with the AP about the show and what comes next. Answers have been edited for clarity and length.",
      "___",
      "HWANG: I learned that I shouldn\u2019t give up. If you love something and if you want to create something, it might not work now, but the time might come later. Or that idea could be the source of inspiration for something else.",
      "HWANG: I'm afraid to talk about it but it's a feature film taking place 10-20 years in the future. It's darker than \u201cSquid Game.\u201d It\u2019s going to be quite cruel, quite sad, but at the same time quite quirky and humorous.",
      "HWANG: I used to think you had to have a specific taste to be cool, but I actually think I\u2019m very omnivorous. I like to watch anything. When I\u2019m on the couch watching TV, sometimes I watch CNN or Fox News. And then National Geographic and nature documentaries, I also watch some very soapy Korean shows or reality TV as well. I hop around and watch everything that\u2019s kind of happening in the world. With a series, I often don\u2019t stick with it the whole way through. There\u2019s only about like five shows that I watched until the very end, like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cWhy Women Kill.\u201d",
      "HWANG: Of course. I studied film school at the University of Southern California and there are so many people I'd love to work with. I have had those offers since \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but because I'm a writer-director I think I'm best when I\u2019m working with Korean actors, giving direction in Korean with my Korean script. But, if I come across an amazing scrip, why not? I'd love to work with Jake Gyllenhaal.",
      "HWANG: With seasons two and three, I had more screen time for more characters. This time around we have a lot of younger characters. When I was creating season one, I thought it was very hard for you to be up to your neck in debt when you\u2019re only in your 20s or 30s. I thought you had to be at least middle-aged to need money and want to join the Squid Game. But the world has changed. Now I feel like there are less decent jobs for young people and they feel like working hard doesn't even get them to middle class. They want to hit the jackpot, so that's why they invest in cryptocurrency. In Korea, there are a lot of young people in their early 20s or 30s turning to online gambling. I wanted to show what society really is like today.",
      "HWANG: It's better than season two."

      "While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor.",
      "The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states.",
      "But some states where abortion remains legal until viability \u2013 generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there\u2019s no fixed time for it \u2013 have seen clinics open and expand.",
      "Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics.",
      "There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers.",
      "But Myers says some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So they\u2019re now in the count of clinics \u2013 even though they might provide few of them.",
      "How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration says hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration\u2019s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho.",
      "More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms and were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records.",
      "Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died.",
      "\u201cIt is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department,\u201d Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.",
      "Since Roe was overturned, there have been 18 reproductive rights-related statewide ballot questions.",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on 14 of them and lost on four.",
      "In the 2024 election, they amended the constitutions in five states to add the right to abortion. Such measures failed in three states: In Florida, where it required 60% support; in Nebraska, which had competing abortion ballot measures; and in South Dakota, where most national abortion rights groups did support the measure.",
      "AP VoteCast data found that more than three-fifths of voters in 2024 supported abortion being legal in all or most cases \u2013 a slight uptick from 2020. The support came even as voters supported Republicans to control the White House and both houses of Congress.",

      "NEW YORK -- If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone.",
      "A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",
      "Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do anything too crazy for New Year\u2019s, usually. So this is definitely a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.\u201d",
      "Woods will be working New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.",
      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "Scientists believe the mutations may allow the virus to better bind to receptors in the upper airways of humans \u2014 something they say is concerning but not a cause for alarm.",
      "Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher, likened this binding interaction to a lock and key. To enter a cell, the virus needs to have a key that turns the lock, and this finding means the virus may be changing to have a key that might work.",

      "The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the U.S., and nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms.",

The person, who has not been identified, is older than 65 and has underlying medical problems, officials said earlier this month.",
      "The CDC stressed there has been no known transmission of the virus from the Louisiana patient to anyone else. The agency said its findings about the mutations were \u201cconcerning,\u201d but the risk to the general public from the outbreak \u201chas not changed and remains low.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sierra Leone's brutal civil war from 1991-2002 created about 28,000 amputees",
      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass.",
      "\u201cThey forgot I had one leg,\u201d the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: \u201cWe fall and we rise.\u201d",
      "The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels.",
      "But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country.",
      "Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week.",
      "More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets.",
      "\u201cNo one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,\u201d Makieu said.",
      "The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees\u2019 confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They\u2019ve trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work.",
      "The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter.",
      "At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor.",
      "\u201cMany (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don\u2019t believe they have love,\u201d the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war.",
      "First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital.",
      "But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders.",
      "His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don\u2019t fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many.",
      "Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child.",
      "Makieu wants to inspire future farmers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my dream to teach people about life. It\u2019s about changing your mindset,\u201d he said.",
      "Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke.",
      "\u201cWe are created for fellowship, not isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.\u201d",
      "Makieu interjected: \u201cI sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.\u201d",
      "But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support.",
      "Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master\u2019s degree in social work, he cannot find a job.",
      "\u201cEven if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,\u201d Kani said.",
      "Sierra Leone\u2019s National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination.",
      "Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education.",
      "But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThe government don\u2019t keep their promises. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Kani said.",
      "There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said.",
      "Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions.",
      "A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand.",
      "Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population.",
      "Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone.",
      "Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer.",
      "\u201cAny successful story, there must be painful experiences,\u201d he said.",

      "The recalled product is packaged in two-pound plastic bags with \u201cbest if used by\u201d dates of May 21, 2026, and June 23, 2026. The company and Oregon authorities said that consumers who bought the recalled product should throw it away immediately and contact the place of purchase for a refund.",
      "No human cases of bird flu have been linked to the incident, but those who were in contact with the cat are being monitored for flu symptoms, Oregon authorities said.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation\u2019s first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said last week.",

But after interviewing, they'd changed their minds, she told MedPage Today. \"They said they realized their volumes had diminished enough that 'we don't really need another full-time bariatric surgeon at this point.'\"",
      "",
      "Until she finds a surgery position that she likes, Adkins is now working in a non-clinical role, as a peer-to-peer utilization reviewer for hospitals.",
      "",
      "Cautious Optimism",
      "",
      "Rogers said that if surgeons think their hospitals are about to cut back or shutter surgery, they should try really hard to talk the hospital out of it, \"because you know, it's going to turn around. It's going to turn around.\"",
      "",
      "She's not alone. Many other bariatric surgeons interviewed said they see the GLP-1 agonists as \"gateway drugs\" that will bring more patients to surgery. Eventually.",
      "",
      "A common lament among nearly all surgeons interviewed is that fear of surgery or social stigma have long kept 99% of patients with obesity who could be helped by bariatric surgery away from seeking any kind of help.",
      "",
      "Now, patients are swarming in, said Fernando Elli, MD, one of four surgeons who performs bariatric surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. \"They want to see us not because they're interested in bariatric surgery. They want the medications,\" he said.",
      "",
      "But many of those patients are learning their insurance won't cover the drugs, or are alarmed that they would have to inject themselves every week indefinitely, or that if they stop, or take a drug holiday, they'll regain the weight.",
      "",
      "\"What we are seeing now with more exposure to these drugs is that patients start the medications but they don't tolerate the side effects. They drop it and say, 'Let's go for surgery,'\" Elli said.",
      "",
      "But that isn't happening a lot, at least not yet. His clinic's surgical volume dropped from 280 in 2023 to 220 this year, which he thinks will be stable until the limitations of the new injectable drugs become clearer, not just to patients but to their doctors as well.",
      "",
      "Surgeons also think that patients will eventually choose surgery because experience and data show surgery produces a greater and faster weight loss after a year than 52 weeks of GLP-1 injections.",
      "",
      "\"At best the GLP-1s can get you to about 14% total body weight loss; surgery is more like 30%,\" after a year or 18 months, Rogers said, pointing to a 2022 review in Advances in Therapy.",
      "",
      "Elli thinks the comparison is 10% to 20% versus 50%, and other surgeons shared different estimates, depending on the patient and the drug.",
      "",
      "Tsai said a head-to-head comparison hasn't yet been published, and perhaps the drug companies aren't eager to fund such a study. \"But at some point the NIH will fund a direct comparison.\"",
      "",
      "Sandi Petros, 33, a restorative dental specialist in San Diego, is an example. At 299 pounds, she never wanted to try the drugs because she knew surgery was faster and more permanent, and she wanted to lose the weight for her two young boys. Last week, 1 year after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, she had dropped 102 pounds. She no longer has type 2 diabetes, and her LDL, 140 before surgery, is now normal.",
      "",
      "Teresa LaMasters, MD, a past president of ASMBS, expressed similar optimism. \"In the long run, the drugs will actually help us.\"",
      "",
      "\"What's going to be the thing that holds patients back on medicines is their cost, access, availability, and how people will tolerate them,\" said LaMasters, who also is the medical director of bariatric surgery at Unity Point Clinic at Iowa Methodist Hospital in West Des Moines.",
      "",
      "Another trend that can improve the prospect of surgery's revival is that several insurance companies have reportedly dropped some of their more rigorous requirements for bariatric preparation, and some have dropped the need for prior authorization review.",
      "",
      "Additionally, some health plans are capping how much they'll pay for the GLP-1 drugs, if they cover them at all. The Mayo Clinic has capped that lifetime spending at $20,000, Elli said.",
      "",
      "An Uptick Already",
      "",
      "Farah Husain, MD, a bariatric surgeon at Banner University Medical Center in Phoenix, said her hospital has seen a small uptick in surgical patients from 550 in 2023 to about 580 this year.",
      "",
      "\"I'm seeing patients sometimes with BMIs of 60, 70, 80, and no one has ever mentioned surgery to them before,\" she said. \"The only reason they come in is because they saw something about the medications. These are people who need such a significant amount of weight loss, they need surgery on top of the drugs.\"",
      "",
      "Some private practice surgeons contracted with Kaiser Permanente to perform bariatric surgery for the health plan's enrollees are also reporting a bump in patients in recent months.",
      "",
      "\"The GLPs have thrust a huge new cost on the Kaiser system that is probably unsustainable,\" said Billy, a Kaiser contractor. Lately, he said, \"we're seeing more Kaiser volume than we've ever seen before.\"",
      "",
      "Many clinicians interviewed said that just as cancer treatment often requires a combination of surgery and drugs, combination therapy will be the treatment plan for many patients with obesity. They may take the medications to lower weight to better prepare them for surgery, or after surgery after they reach a plateau.",
      "",
      "A possible offsetting factor is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposal last month that it would pay for the new weight loss drugs in 2026, if the new administration approves.",
      "",
      "Making Adjustments",
      "",
      "The Mayo Clinic has made adjustments to respond to the change in surgical volume, Elli said. \"We have shifted our practice so that we have more non-surgical practitioners to accommodate those patients who don't want surgery.\"",
      "",
      "Nationally, he expects many bariatric surgeons will adjust as well, diversifying their surgical repertoire. \"Surgeons who are only doing bariatric surgery need to reconfigure,\" he said. \"Current bariatric fellowship graduates may find it difficult to obtain a pure bariatric practice and may need to alternate with acute care surgery.\"",
      "",
      "For many bariatric surgeons, the prospect of taking on general surgery  --  where often it's one-and-done  --  goes against the reason they chose weight-loss surgery as a specialty. They wanted longer-term relationships with their patients.",
      "",
      "\"We operate on the patients and ideally follow them for as long as they're willing to come back, to make sure they're maintaining weight loss and healthy habits and help them along the way,\" Husain said. \"The theme in our world is that obesity is a chronic disease.\"",
      "",
      "The Payers Aren't Helping",
      "",
      "Benjamin Clapp, MD, a bariatric surgeon at Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus in El Paso, Texas, chairs the ASMBS task force that tracks bariatric surgical volume every year.",
      "",
      "He said neither the official totals for 2023 nor estimates for 2024 are collected yet. However, data from centers accredited by the American College of Surgeons, which perform about 80% to 83% of all bariatric surgeries in this country, show that volumes were down by 5.5%, or more than 12,000 weight-reduction surgeries, in 2023.",
      "",
      "But 2024 is expected to be \"much, much worse because of the overwhelming impact that the GLP-1 drugs have had, which really took off this year,\" Clapp said.",
      "",
      "This year in El Paso he expects to perform 120 bariatric surgeries, compared with 180 in 2023. \"These are massive decreases in volume, at least for me,\" he said. \"I went from seeing 15 to 20 new bariatric patients weekly to one to three.\"",
      "",
      "The Center for Metabolic and Weight Loss Surgery at Columbia University said earlier this year that it expected a 10% to 20% decline in 2024 from 2023.",
      "",
      "That drop in bariatric demand is one of two big reasons why Clapp has made a career decision to leave the solo practice he has built up for the last 18 years.",
      "",
      "Sometime next year, he plans to either take an academic job and devote more time to studying how brain receptors function in rats with obesity, or become an employed hospital surgeon. On staff, he would do any variety of procedures and probably far fewer bariatric procedures on which he has built his practice.",
      "",
      "The other reason is declining reimbursement. Clapp said Medicare rates for common bariatric surgery CPT codes have dropped since 2019, despite rising inflation in practice costs. A check with Medicare's physician fee lookup tool shows he's right. For example, the national payment amount for a laparoscopic gastric bypass with small intestine reconstruction dropped from $1,937.82 to $1,842.13 between 2019 and 2024. Insurance companies generally follow Medicare.",
      "",
      "What's worse is that consultation pay has also been going down or has disappeared. \"Things are bundled more, so you get paid less overall,\" he said. \"It's like death by 1,000 cuts.\" Solo private practice \"has just become a model that's not sustainable, for myself or for my family.\"",
      "",
      "Clapp has filled in some of the blanks with other foregut surgeries, such as cholecystectomies and hernia repairs, but reimbursement rates have dropped for those, too, especially relative to his own practice costs.",
      "",
      "San Diego bariatric surgeon William Fuller, MD, said Scripps Mercy Hospital, one of the largest programs on the West Coast, will have performed around 800 bariatric surgeries in 2024, down from the prior year's 1,000. But he doesn't expect a year-over-year decline in perpetuity as some of his counterparts fear.",
      "",
      "\"Who knows when there will be a stabilization of this whole phenomenon?\" he asked rhetorically during an interview with a public relations representative present. \"But we see patients who tried some of these medications  --  when they had access to them  --  and they haven't had the same success. They had some rebound, regained weight, or just didn't have success to begin with.\"",
      "",
      "Bottom line: \"It's all about sustainability, which is always the case with medications,\" he said. \"How long can you remain on them, and for efficacy purposes and economic purposes, how are these medications going to be funded, with what kind of subsidies? There's still a lot of moving parts.\""

If confirmed as HHS secretary, Kennedy is expected to set much of the agenda.",

      "\"If President Trump's nomination of RFK Jr. to be secretary is confirmed, if you don't subscribe to his views, it will be very hard to rise in that department,\" said Amesh Adalja, MD, an infectious disease specialist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"They will need to suppress their views to fit with RFK Jr's. In this administration, and any administration, independent public disagreement isn't welcome.\"",
      "",
      "Kennedy is chair of Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit. He has vowed to curb the country's appetite for ultra-processed food and its incidence of chronic disease. He helped select Trump's choices to lead the CDC, the FDA, and the NIH. If confirmed, he would lead them from the helm of HHS, with its more than $1.7 trillion budget.",
      "",
      "Clashes are likely. Kennedy has supported access to abortion until a fetus is viable. That puts him at odds with Dave Weldon, MD, the former Florida congressman whom Trump has chosen to run the CDC. Weldon, a physician, is an abortion opponent who wrote one of the major laws allowing health professionals to opt out of participating in the procedure.",
      "",
      "Weldon would head an agency that's been in the crosshairs of conservatives since the COVID pandemic began. He has touted his \"100% pro-life voting record\" on his campaign website. (He unsuccessfully ran earlier this year for a seat in Florida's House of Representatives.)",
      "",
      "Trump has said he would leave decisions about abortion to the states, but the CDC under Weldon could, for example, fund studies on abortion risks. The agency could require states to provide information about abortions performed within their borders to the federal government or risk the loss of federal funds.",
      "",
      "Weldon, like Kennedy, has questioned the safety of vaccines and has said he believes they can cause autism. That's at odds with the views of Marty Makary, MD, MPH, a Johns Hopkins surgeon whom Trump plans to nominate for FDA commissioner. The British American said on the \"Brian Kilmeade Show\" on Fox News Radio that vaccines \"save lives,\" although he added that it's good to question the U.S. vaccine schedule for children.",
      "",
      "The American Academy of Pediatricians encourages parents and their children's doctors to stick to the recommended schedule of childhood vaccines. \"Nonstandard schedules that spread out vaccines or start when a child is older put entire communities at risk of serious illnesses, including infants and young children,\" the group says in guidance for its members.",
      "",
      "Jay Bhattacharya, MD, PhD, a doctor and economist who is Trump's selection to lead NIH, has also supported vaccines.",

The World Health Organization warned that such an approach would overwhelm hospitals.",

He promoted the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment.

Costas Papapoulios, the head of the region\u2019s hoteliers association, said the survivors were being taken to other nearby hotels at the expense of the association and the local government. \u201cThe owner was trying to help guests and he must have got trapped,\u201d Papapoulios told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's not clear whether he jumped from the balcony to escape from the flames or was overwhelmed by the smoke and fell.\u201d",

Some 350 kilometers (220 miles) north of Athens, the site is a popular short-break destination. Witnesses of the fire described chaotic scenes that occurred shortly after dawn on Monday, with some residents trying to use bed sheets to climb down from balconies. The fire gutted much of the hotel's interior and blackened the walls and ceilings of rooms, and hallways of the building, where firefighters entered during the rescue.",
      "Four children were among those injured who were all taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Trikala. The Fire Service said 34 firefighters with 12 vehicles responded to the blaze, the cause of which was not immediately clear."

      "The were members of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria between October 2015 and December 2017, the prosecutor said in a statement. They allegedly kept a 5-year-old Yazidi girl as a slave starting in late 2015, and a 12-year-old from October 2017.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that the man raped both girls repeatedly and that the woman prepared the room and put makeup on one of the girls.",

      "\u201cAll of this served the organization\u2019s objective to destroy the Yazidi religion,\u201d the statement said."

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia's public prosecutor on Monday indicted 13 people, including a former minister, over the collapse of a concrete canopy that killed 15 last month and triggered weeks of massive anti-government protests.",
      "The suspects were charged in the northern city of Novi Sad, where the Nov. 1 collapse happened, with committing a grave criminal act against public safety and irregular execution of construction work. If convicted, they face up to 12 years in prison.",
      "The huge concrete canopy was part of a railway station building, which was renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese companies. Many in Serbia believe that the work on the station was sloppy due to rampant corruption, and caused the canopy to crash down.",
      "Serbia's Prime Minister Milos Vucevic said the indictment \"confirms that no one has an intention to hide, conceal or obstruct anything.\u201d",
      "Critics, however, said the charges were flawed because they did not include a financial probe into alleged graft.",
      "\u201cI think (the indictment) is a legal play and an attempt to throw dust in our eyes,\u201d said opposition politician Borislav Novakovic. \u201cThere is no mention of corruption which actually fell on everybody's heads on that day.\u201d",
      "Widespread anger fueled the almost daily demonstrations against populist President Aleksandar Vuci c and his government.",
      "Street protests, led by university students, took place Monday in Novi Sad, and skirmishes with the police were reported. Also, in Belgrade, hundreds blocked traffic and stood in silence for 15 minutes at 11.52 to commemorate the exact time of the collapse in honor of the victims.",
      "Striking students plan similar protests on New Year's Eve in both cities.",
      "Initially, 14 people were killed and three injured. One other person later died in a hospital.",
      "The indictment has to be confirmed by a court to become valid. The prosecutor in Novi Sad also called for the suspects to be detained pending the proceedings against them. Apart from former Construction Minister Goran Vesic, others include officials and those who were in charge of the renovation work.",
      "Vesic was detained several weeks ago but was released, fueling doubts about the investigation and the independence of the Serbian judiciary under the populist government, which holds a tight grip on all state institutions, including the judiciary.",
      "It was not immediately clear when a trial could start.",
      "The recent persistent protests and a strike by university students in Serbia have challenged Vucic's hold on power. The Serbian leader formally seeks European Union membership for his nation but has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms rather than advancing them."

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean officials are struggling to determine what caused a deadly plane crash that killed 179 people, with the nation saddened, shocked and ashamed over the country's worst aviation disaster in decades.",
      "Many observers also worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the aftermath of Sunday's crash as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country\u2019s top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon\u2019s brief martial law introduction earlier this month.",
      "New Acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed the Transport Ministry and police to launch investigations into its cause. He also ordered the ministry to implement an emergency review of the country\u2019s overall aircraft operation systems.",
      "\u201cThe essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\u201d said Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korea\u2019s budget airline Jeju Air skidded off a runway at Muan International Airport in the country\u2019s south, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball. The incident killed all but two of the 181 people aboard. The two survivors are both crew members, and they were pulled from the plane's tail section \u2014 the only part that was still recognizable after the crash.",
      "Joo Jong-wan, the Transport Ministry\u2019s director of aviation policy, said authorities have so far identified 141 of the bodies, and are conducting DNA tests on the other 38.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines and now a consultant, said the Boeing 737-800 is a \u201cproven airplane\u201d that belongs to a different class of aircraft than the Boeing 737 Max jetliner that was linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",
      "But the Transport Ministry said Monday the government plans to conduct safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 jetliners operated by the country\u2019s airlines.",
      "Ministry officials said they will also look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and they did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, said John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for a barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said.",
      "Other observers say the videos showed the plane suffering suspected engine trouble but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They say there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problems and the suspected engine problem.",
      "The Transport Ministry said Sunday the control tower issued a warning about birds to the Jeju Air plane shortly before it intended to land and gave the crew permission to land in a different area. It said the plane\u2019s pilot sent out a distress signal shortly before the crash.",
      "Investigators retrieved the jet\u2019s flight data and cockpit voice recorders, but it may take months to complete the probe into the crash, Joo, the Transport Ministry official, told reporters.",
      "The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "Sunday's crash caused an outpouring of public sympathy for the dead, with the government issuing a seven-day national mourning period. Some questioned if the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, like the 2022 Halloween crush that killed 160 people and the 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "The crash was yet more big news for South Koreans as they reel from a festering political crisis set off by Yoon's martial law decree, which brought hundreds of troops into Seoul streets and revived traumatic memories of past military rule in the 1970-80s.",
      "The political tumult resulted in the opposition-controlled National Assembly impeaching Yoon and Han. The safety minister stepped down and the police chief was arrested over their roles in the martial law enhancement.",
      "The absence of top officials responsible for managing disasters has also led to concerns.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply worried if the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters really can handle the disaster,\u201d the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial on Monday."

      "Syria's long-ruling Baath party has frozen its activities after insurgents overthrew President Bashar Assad weeks ago",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- A few days after insurgents in Syria overthrew President Bashar Assad, his ruling Baath party announced it was freezing its activities, marking a stunning change in fortunes for the political group that had ruled for more than six decades.",
      "Many members of the party's leadership have gone into hiding and some have fled the country. In a symbolic move, Syria's new rulers have turned the former party headquarters in Damascus into a center where former members of the army and security forces line up to register their names and hand over their weapons.",
      "Calls are on the rise to officially dissolve the Arab Socialist Baath Party that had ruled Syria since 1963.",
      "Many Syrians \u2014 including former party members \u2014 say its rule damaged relations with other Arab countries and aided in the spread of corruption that brought the war-torn nation to its knees.",
      "\u201cThe party should not only be dissolved, it should go to hell,\u201d said Mohammed Hussein Ali, 64, who worked for a state oil company and was a party member for decades until he quit at the start of Syria\u2019s anti-government uprising in 2011 that turned into civil war. He never left the country and said he is happy the Baath rule is over.",
      "An official with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the group that led the insurgent offensive that overthrew Assad, said no official decision has been made on what to do with the Baath party.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, noted that HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa has said that officials who committed crimes against the Syrian people over the past decades will be brought to justice and hinted that they include party members.",
      "The Baath party, whose aim was to unify Arab states in one nation, was founded by two Syrian Arab nationalists, Michel Aflaq and Salaheddine Bitar, in 1947 and at one point ruled two Arab countries, Iraq and Syria.",
      "A rivalry developed between the Syrian branch under Assad and his late father, Hafez, and the one in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, who was removed from power by a U.S.-led invasion in 2003.",
      "In Syria, the Baath party became inextricably associated with the Assad family, which took power in 1970. For decades, the family used the party and its pan-Arab ideology to control the country. Many senior military jobs were held by members of the family\u2019s minority Alawite sect, and party membership was used as a cover to give it a nationalist rather than a sectarian nature.",
      "A former soldier and decades-long Baath party member who came to party headquarters to cut his military ties, Abdul-Rahman Ali, said he had no idea it was founded by Aflaq and Bitar. He had always thought that Hafez Assad was the founder.",
      "\u201cI am happy. We have been liberated from fear,\u201d said Ali, 43. \u201cEven the walls had ears. We didn't dare express opinions with anyone.\u201d He was referring to the dreaded security and intelligence agencies that detained and tortured people who expressed criticism of Assad or government officials.",
      "Many Syrians were required to join the Baath Vanguards, the party's youth branch, while in elementary school, where Arab nationalist and socialist ideology was emphasized.",
      "It was difficult for people who were not party members to get government jobs or join the army or the security and intelligence services.",
      "In 2012, a year after Syria's uprising began, a paragraph of the constitution stating that the Baath party was the leader of the nation and society was abolished, in a move aimed to appease the public's demand for political reforms. In practice, however, the party remained in control, with members holding majority seats in parliament and government.",
      "Another former soldier, who gave only his first name, Ghadir, out of fear of reprisals as a member of the Alawite sect, said he came from a poor family and joined the party so he could enter the military for a stable income.",
      "\u201cYou could not take any job if you were not a Baathist,\u201d he said.",
      "While few are mourning the party's fall in Syria, some are concerned that the Sunni majority that now controls the country could carry out a purge similar to the one in Iraq after Saddam\u2019s fall.",
      "A de-Baathification committee was formed in Iraq and its main job was purging Saddam loyalists from government and military institutions. The Sunni minority considered it a means of sectarian score-settling by Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority. The Sunni resentment and disenfranchisement that followed helped to drive the rise of extremist groups in the country including al-Qaida and the Islamic State in Iraq.",
      "In Syria, a Baath party statement issued three days after Assad\u2019s fall called on all members to hand their weapons and public cars to the new authorities.",
      "On Dec. 24, party member and former army colonel Mohammed Merhi was among hundreds who lined up at the former party headquarters and handed over weapons.",
      "Merhi said the Baath party should be given another opportunity because its principles are good but were exploited over decades. But he said he might want to join another party if Syria becomes a multiparty democracy in the future.",
      "He handed over his Soviet Makarov pistol and received a document saying he can now move freely in the country after reconciling with the new authorities.",

The war will \u201ccontinue to cause a humanitarian disaster in every sense of the word. And women always pay the biggest price,\u201d she said.",
      "Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.",
      "Israel launched its assault in retaliation for the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on southern Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others.",

      "Hamami can walk the length of her small tent in a few strides. She shares it with 13 other people from her extended family. During the war, she gave birth to a son, Ahmed, who is now 8 months old. Between caring for him and her two other children, washing her family\u2019s laundry, cooking and waiting in line for water, she says there\u2019s no time to care for herself.",
      "She has a few objects that remind her of what her life once was, including a powder compact she brought with her when she fled her home in the Shati camp of Gaza City. The makeup is now caked and crumbling. She managed to keep hold of a small mirror through four different displacements over the past year. It\u2019s broken into two shards that she holds together every so often to catch a glimpse of her reflection.",
      "\u201cPreviously, I had a wardrobe that contained everything I could wish for,\u201d she said. \u201cWe used to go out for a walk every day, go to wedding parties, go to parks, to malls, to buy everything we wanted.\"",
      "Women \u201clost their being and everything in this war,\" she said. \"Women used to take care of themselves before the war. Now everything is destroyed.\u201d",

      "What began as a childhood hobby more than six decades ago has led to what might be Africa\u2019s largest butterfly collection in a suburb of Kenya\u2019s capital",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- What began as a childhood hobby more than six decades ago has led to what might be Africa's largest butterfly collection in a suburb of Kenya's capital.",
      "Steve Collins, 74, was born and raised in western Kenya. By the age of 5, he was fascinated by butterflies and started building a collection that has grown to more than 4.2 million, representing hundreds of species.",
      "\u201cMy parents encouraged us to look for butterflies after visiting the Congo and were gifted a trapping net by some friends,\" Collins said. \u201cBy the time I was 15 years old, I was already visiting other countries like Nigeria to study more about butterflies.\u201d",
      "During his 20-year career as an agronomist, Collins dedicated his free time to research. He established the African Butterfly Research Institute in 1997.",
      "Now, running out of space and time, he hopes to hand it over to the next generation.",
      "On his 1.5 acres (0.6 hectare) of land, hundreds of indigenous trees and flowering bushes form a well-knit forest. Hundreds of butterflies dance from one flower to another, at times landing on Collins' hand.",
      "His collection is private, although it was initially open to the public when he ran it as an education center between 1998 and 2003.",
      "Collins has 1.2 million butterflies from across Africa delicately pinned in frames and stored in rows of shelves, with another 3 million in envelopes.",
      "\u201cThey need to be kept in dark spaces,\" he said. \u201cThe form of storage also ensures the dried butterflies are not eaten by other insects, parasites and predators. We also ensure we apply insecticides once a year to keep them safe.\u201d",
      "Julian Bayliss, an ecologist specializing in Africa and a visiting professor at Oxford Brookes University, said he has collected butterflies for Collins over two decades.",
      "\u201cThere is a large part of that collection that is completely irreplaceable because a large part of Africa\u2019s habitat is being destroyed,\u201d Bayliss said.",
      "Africa is vulnerable to climate change, with periods of prolonged drought and serious flooding destroying forests and other butterfly habitats.",
      "Bayliss suggested digitizing the collection to make it accessible worldwide.",
      "Whoever takes it over \"needs to be an institution that is well-founded, well-funded and secure,\u201d he said.",
      "Scott Miller, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Institution, met Collins almost 30 years ago. He said such collections provide critical information that could show environmental changes over 60 years.",
      "\u201cThese physical specimens, you can actually keep going back to them to get new layers of information as you learn more or you get a different technology or you get different questions,\" he said.",
      "Collins is concerned that soon he will no longer be able to sustain his research. He said his most prized butterfly costs $8,000 \u2014 which he keeps from sight, concerned about possible theft \u2014 and hopes to sell the collection to an individual or research institution.",
      "The costs of running his institute are high. An annual budget posted in 2009 on the Lepidopterists' Society of Africa website was $200,000.",
      "Collins estimates that the specimens and other assets are worth $8 million.",
      "\u201cThis has been my hobby for decades, and I can\u2019t put a price on what I have done so far. I\u2019m currently seeking to ensure the species are in safe hands when I\u2019m out of this world,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "South Korean law enforcement officials have requested a court warrant to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol as they investigate whether his short-lived martial law decree this month amounted to rebellion",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean law enforcement officials requested a court warrant on Monday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol as they investigate whether his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3 amounted to rebellion.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which leads a joint investigation with police and military authorities into the power grab that lasted only a few hours, confirmed it requested the warrant from the Seoul Western District Court. They plan to question Yoon on charges of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion.",
      "Yoon Kap-keun, the president\u2019s lawyer, denounced the detention attempt and filed a challenge with the same court, arguing that the warrant request was invalid. He also claimed the anti-corruption agency lacked the legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. Still, he evaded answering how the legal team would respond if the court approved the warrant for the president\u2019s detainment.",
      "\u201cAn incumbent president cannot be prosecuted for abuse of power,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cOf course, there are differing academic opinions on whether a president can be investigated for abuse of power and some assert that investigations are possible. But even when investigations are allowed, the prevailing opinion is that they should be exercised with the utmost restraint.\u201d",
      "The anti-corruption agency didn\u2019t immediately respond to the lawyer\u2019s comments.",
      "Han Min-soo, spokesperson of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, called for the court to issue the warrant, saying Yoon Suk Yeol's detainment would be the first step toward \u201cending the rebellion and restoring normalcy.\u201d",
      "The warrant request came after Yoon dodged several requests by the joint investigation team and public prosecutors to appear for questioning and also blocked searches of his offices.",
      "While Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution, such protections don\u2019t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "It\u2019s not clear whether the court will grant the warrant or whether Yoon can be compelled to appear for questioning.",
      "Under the country\u2019s laws, locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge, and it\u2019s unlikely that Yoon will voluntarily leave his residence if he faces detention. There are also concerns about possible clashes with Yoon\u2019s presidential security service if authorities attempt to forcibly detain him.",
      "Yoon\u2019s presidential powers were suspended after the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil, halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets.",
      "Yoon\u2019s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.",
      "The National Assembly voted last week to also impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who had assumed the role of acting president after Yoon\u2019s powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court\u2019s review of Yoon\u2019s case. The country\u2019s new interim leader is Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who is also finance minister.",
      "To formally end Yoon\u2019s presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor. Three seats are currently vacant following retirements and a full bench could make conviction more likely.",
      "Choi, who has been handling the government\u2019s response to a plane crash on Sunday that killed 179 people, has yet to say whether he intends to appoint the Constitutional Court justices.",
      "In a separate criminal investigation of Yoon, authorities have already arrested his defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders involved in the attempt to enforce the martial law decree, which harkened back to the days of authoritarian leaders the country hasn\u2019t seen since the 1980s.",
      "In theory, the authority to investigate rebellion charges lies solely with the police, following a 2021 reform that redistributed investigative powers among law enforcement agencies and removed rebellion from the list of crimes prosecutors and the anti-corruption office could pursue. But those agencies have still been investigating rebellion accusations against Yoon, allegedly linked to charges related to abuse of power, a type of crime they are authorized to investigate.",
      "Yoon and his military leadership have been accused of attempting to block the National Assembly from voting to end martial law by sending hundreds of heavily armed troops to encircle the building. Lawmakers who managed to get in voted unanimously 190-0 to lift martial law, hours after Yoon declared it in a late-night television address.",
      "Yoon has also been accused of ordering defense counterintelligence officials to detain key politicians, including opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik and the ex-leader of his own conservative party, Han Dong-hun, a reformist who supported investigations into corruption allegations against first lady Kim Keon Hee.",
      "Yoon has defended the martial law decree as a necessary act of governance, portraying it as a temporary warning against the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which he has described as an \u201canti-state\u201d force obstructing his agenda with its majority in the National Assembly. Yoon has claimed he had no intention to paralyze the functioning of the assembly, saying that the troops were sent to maintain order, and also denied planning to arrest politicians.",
      "Yoon\u2019s claims have been denied by Kwak Jong-keun, the now-arrested commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, who testified in the National Assembly that Yoon called for troops to \u201cquickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside\u201d the assembly\u2019s main chamber where the vote occurred. Kwak said he did not carry out Yoon\u2019s orders.",
      "The joint investigation team has also questioned Maj. Gen. Moon Sang-ho, commander of the Defense Intelligence Command who has also been arrested over suspicions that he sent troops to the National Election Commission in the city of Gwacheon after Yoon declared martial law.",
      "Yoon has defended the troop deployment to the election commission, which happened at the same time as the military operation at the National Assembly, saying it was necessary to investigate supposed vulnerabilities in the commission\u2019s computer systems potentially affecting the credibility of election results.",
      "Yoon\u2019s failure to offer any evidence in support of his claims has raised concerns that he was endorsing conspiracy theories on right-wing YouTube channels that April\u2019s parliamentary elections were rigged. The Democratic Party won those elections by a landslide. The election commission rejected Yoon\u2019s allegations, stating there was no basis to suspect election fraud."

      "People in Zimbabwe are shunning traditional grocery stores to do their shopping at informal and illegal markets that pop up at night to avoid police raids rampant during the day",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Batsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space \u2014 an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Traditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility of Zimbabwe's new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities.",
      "From dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery.",
      "Unfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my first time shopping here. My friend told me that it\u2019s much cheaper than the supermarkets,\u201d 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. \u201cI decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "For the same amount in a supermarket a week ago, Pabwe said he only managed to get \u201cmeat and spices and they were not even that much.\u201d",
      "The once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people.",
      "It is the country\u2019s sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the world\u2019s worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies.",
      "The latest currency, the world\u2019s newest, came with pomp and fanfare \u2014 promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online.",
      "Seven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar.",
      "Traditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September.",

      "Just over two years after the debut of ChatGPT, the world is getting a little savvier about what artificial intelligence technology can do for us and what it\u2019s not so great at",
      "If 2023 was a year of wonder about artificial intelligence, 2024 was the year to try to get that wonder to do something useful without breaking the bank.",
      "There was a \u201cshift from putting out models to actually building products,\u201d said Arvind Narayanan, a Princeton University computer science professor and co-author of the new book \u201cAI Snake Oil: What Artificial Intelligence Can Do, What It Can\u2019t, and How to Tell The Difference.\u201d",
      "The first 100 million or so people who experimented with ChatGPT upon its release two years ago actively sought out the chatbot, finding it amazingly helpful at some tasks or laughably mediocre at others.",
      "Now such generative AI technology is baked into an increasing number of technology services whether we're looking for it or not \u2014 for instance, through the AI-generated answers in Google search results or new AI techniques in photo editing tools.",
      "\u201cThe main thing that was wrong with generative AI last year is that companies were releasing these really powerful models without a concrete way for people to make use of them,\u201d said Narayanan. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing this year is gradually building out these products that can take advantage of those capabilities and do useful things for people.\"",
      "At the same time, since OpenAI released GPT-4 in March 2023 and competitors introduced similarly performing AI large language models, these models have stopped getting significantly \u201cbigger and qualitatively better,\" resetting overblown expectations that AI was racing every few months to some kind of better-than-human intelligence, Narayanan said. That's also meant that the public discourse has shifted from \u201cis AI going to kill us?\u201d to treating it like a normal technology, he said.",
      "On quarterly earnings calls this year, tech executives often heard questions from Wall Street analysts looking for assurances of future payoffs from huge spending on AI research and development. Building AI systems behind generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini requires investing in energy-hungry computing systems running on powerful and expensive AI chips. They require so much electricity that tech giants announced deals this year to tap into nuclear power to help run them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of capital that has been poured into this technology,\u201d said Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan.",
      "Another analyst at the New York investment bank drew attention over the summer by arguing AI isn't solving the complex problems that would justify its costs. He also questioned whether AI models, even as they're being trained on much of the written and visual data produced over the course of human history, will ever be able to do what humans do so well. Rangan has a more optimistic view.",
      "\u201cWe had this fascination that this technology is just going to be absolutely revolutionary, which it has not been in the two years since the introduction of ChatGPT,\u201d Rangan said. \"It\u2019s more expensive than we thought and it\u2019s not as productive as we thought.\"",
      "Rangan, however, is still bullish about its potential and says that AI tools are already proving \u201cabsolutely incrementally more productive\u201d in sales, design and a number of other professions.",
      "Some workers wonder whether AI tools will be used to supplement their work or to replace them as the technology continues to grow. The tech company Borderless AI has been using an AI chatbot from Cohere to write up employment contracts for workers in Turkey or India without the help of outside lawyers or translators.",
      "Video game performers with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists who went on strike in July said they feared AI could reduce or eliminate job opportunities because it could be used to replicate one performance into a number of other movements without their consent. Concerns about how movie studios will use AI helped fuel last year\u2019s film and television strikes by the union, which lasted four months. Game companies have also signed side agreements with the union that codify certain AI protections in order to keep working with actors during the strike.",
      "Musicians and authors have voiced similar concerns over AI scraping their voices and books. But generative AI still can't create unique work or \u201ccompletely new things,\u201d said Walid Saad, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and AI expert at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cWe can train it with more data so it has more information. But having more information doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cAs humans, we understand the world around us, right? We understand the physics. You understand if you throw a ball on the ground, it\u2019s going to bounce. AI tools currently don\u2019t understand the world.\u201d",
      "AI can mimic what it learns from patterns, he said, but can\u2019t \u201cunderstand the world so that they reason on what happens in the future.\u201d That, he said, is where AI falls short.",
      "\u201cIt still cannot imagine things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that imagination is what we hope to achieve later.\u201d",
      "Saad pointed to a meme about AI as an example of that shortcoming. When someone prompted an AI engine to create an image of salmon swimming in a river, he said, the AI created a photo of a river with cut pieces of salmon found in grocery stores.",
      "\u201cWhat AI lacks today is the common sense that humans have, and I think that is the next step,\u201d he said.",
      "That type of reasoning is a key part of the process of making AI tools more useful to consumers, said Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president of Cisco's innovation and incubation arm, Outshift. AI developers are increasingly pitching the next wave of generative AI chatbots as AI \u201cagents\u201d that can do more useful things on people\u2019s behalf.",
      "That could mean being able to ask an AI agent an ambiguous question and have the model able to reason and plan out steps to solving an ambitious problem, Pandey said. A lot of technology, he said, is going to move in that direction in 2025.",
      "Pandey predicts that eventually, AI agents will be able to come together and perform a job the way multiple people come together and solve a problem as a team rather than simply accomplishing tasks as individual AI tools. The AI agents of the future will work as an ensemble, he said.",
      "Future Bitcoin software, for example, will likely rely on the use of AI software agents, Pandey said. Those agents will each have a specialty, he said, with \u201cagents that check for correctness, agents that check for security, agents that check for scale.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting to an agentic future,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have all these agents being very good at certain skills, but also have a little bit of a character or color to them, because that\u2019s how we operate.\u201d",
      "AI tools have also streamlined, or lent in some cases a literal helping hand, to the medical field. This year's Nobel Prize in chemistry \u2014 one of two Nobels awarded to AI-related science \u2014 went to work led by Google that could help discover new medicines.",
      "Saad, the Virginia Tech professor, said that AI has helped bring faster diagnostics by quickly giving doctors a starting point to launch from when determining a patient's care. AI can't detect disease, he said, but it can quickly digest data and point out potential problem areas for a real doctor to investigate. As with other arenas, however, it poses a risk of perpetuating falsehoods.",
      "Tech giant OpenAI has touted its AI-powered transcription tool Whisper as having near \u201chuman level robustness and accuracy,\u201d for example. But experts have said that Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences.",
      "Pandey, of Cisco, said that some of the company's customers who work in pharmaceuticals have noted that AI has helped bridge the divide between \u201cwet labs,\u201d in which humans conduct physical experiments and research, and \u201cdry labs\u201d where people analyze data and often use computers for modeling.",
      "When it comes to pharmaceutical development, that collaborative process can take several years, he said \u2014 with AI, the process can be cut to a few days.",
      "\"That, to me, has been the most dramatic use,\" Pandey said."

      "South Korean officials plan to conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines, as they struggle to determine what caused a weekend plane crash that killed 179 people",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean officials said Monday they will conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines, as they struggle to determine what caused a plane crash that killed 179 people a day earlier.",
      "Sunday's crash, the country\u2019s worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy. Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country\u2019s top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon\u2019s brief imposition of martial law earlier this month.",
      "New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed authorities to conduct an emergency review of the country\u2019s aircraft operation systems.",
      "\u201cThe essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\u201d said Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air aborted its first landing attempt for reasons that aren\u2019t immediately clear. Then, during its second landing attempt, it received a bird strike warning from the ground control center before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines and now a consultant, said the Boeing 737-800 is a \u201cproven airplane\u201d that belongs to a different class of aircraft than the Boeing 737 Max jetliner that was linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",
      "But South Korea's Transport Ministry said Monday it plans to conduct safety inspections of all of the 101 Boeing 737-800 jetliners operated by the country\u2019s airlines as well as a broader review into safety standards at Jeju Air, which operates 39 of those planes. Senior ministry official Joo Jong-wan said representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing were expected to arrive in South Korea on Monday to participate in the investigation.",
      "Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa.",
      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, said John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said.",
      "Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They said there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue.",
      "Earlier Monday, another Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air returned to Seoul\u2019s Gimpo International Airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot detected a landing gear issue. Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment center, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precautionary measure.",
      "Joo said officials were reviewing whether there might have been communication problems between air traffic controllers and the pilot. \u201cOur current understanding is that, at some point during the go-around process, communication became somewhat ineffective or was interrupted, ahead of the landing and impact,\u201d he said.",
      "Ministry officials said Monday the plane\u2019s flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Gimpo airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",
      "The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "The crash left many South Koreans shocked and ashamed, with the government announcing a seven-day national mourning period through Jan. 4. Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "The Transport Ministry said authorities have identified 146 bodies and are collecting DNA and fingerprint samples from the other 33.",
      "Park Han Shin, a representative of the bereaved families, said they were told that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to their families.",
      "\u201cI demand that the government mobilize more personnel to return our brothers and family members as intact as possible more swiftly,\u201d he said, choking down tears.",
      "The crash was yet more major news for South Koreans already reeling from a political crisis set off by Yoon\u2019s martial law decree, which brought hundreds of troops into Seoul streets and revived traumatic memories of past military rule in the 1970-80s.",
      "The political tumult resulted in the opposition-controlled National Assembly impeaching Yoon and Han. The safety minister stepped down and the police chief was arrested over their roles in the martial law inforcement.",
      "The absence of top officials responsible for managing disasters has led to concerns.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply worried whether the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters really can handle the disaster,\u201d the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial Monday."

      "The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and aviation experts were quick to distinguish Sunday's incident from the company\u2019s earlier safety problems.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines who is now a consultant, said it would be inappropriate to link the incident Sunday to two fatal crashes involving Boeing\u2019s troubled 737 Max jetliner in 2018 and 2019. In January this year, a door plug blew off a 737 Max while it was in flight, raising more questions about the plane.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 that crash-landed in Korea, Price noted, is \u201ca very proven airplane. \"It\u2019s different from the Max ...It\u2019s a very safe airplane.\u2019\u2019",
      "For decades, Boeing has maintained a role as one of the giants of American manufacturing. But the the past year's repeated troubles have been damaging. The company's stock price is down more than 30% in 2024.",
      "The company's reputation for safety was especially tarnished by the 737 Max crashes, which occurred off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 and left a combined 346 people dead. In the five years since then, Boeing has lost more than $23 billion. And it has fallen behind its European rival, Airbus, in selling and delivering new planes.",
      "Last fall, 33,000 Boeing machinists went on strike, crippling the production of the 737 Max, the company's bestseller, the 777 airliner and 767 cargo plane. The walkout lasted seven weeks, until members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreed to an offer that included 38% pay raises over four years.",
      "In January, a door plug blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. Federal regulators responded by imposing limits on Boeing aircraft production that they said would remain in place until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.",
      "In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration regulators who approved the 737 Max. Acting on Boeing\u2019s incomplete disclosures, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training instead of more intensive training in flight simulators. Simulator training would have increased the cost for airlines to operate the Max and might have pushed some to buy planes from Airbus instead. (Prosecutors said they lacked evidence to argue that Boeing\u2019s deception had played a role in the crashes.)",
      "But the plea deal was rejected this month by a federal judge in Texas, Reed O\u2019Connor, who decided that diversity, inclusion and equity or DEI policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in choosing an official to oversee Boeing\u2019s compliance with the agreement.",
      "Boeing has sought to change its culture. Under intense pressure over safety issues, David Calhoun departed as CEO in August. Since January, 70,000 Boeing employees have participated in meetings to discuss ways to improve safety."

      "\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That\u2019s why we have them,\" Trump said.",
      "In fact, Trump has in the past criticized the H-1B visas, calling them \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers.

      "NEW YORK -- If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone.",
      "A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",
      "Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do anything too crazy for New Year\u2019s, usually. So this is definitely a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.\u201d",
      "Woods will be working New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.",
      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "The Canadians called the talks \u201cproductive\u201d and said there would be further discussions but one official said the Americans remain fixated on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada.",
      "Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly met with Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, as well as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Interior Department.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States \u2014 even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.",
      "\u201cMinister LeBlanc and Minister Joly had a positive, productive meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Howard Lutnick and Doug Burgum, as a follow-up to the dinner between the Prime Minister and President Trump last month,\u201d said Jean-S\u00e9bastien Comeau, a spokesman for LeBlanc.",
      "Comeau said both ministers outlined the measures in Canada's billion-dollar plan to increase security at the border and reiterated \u201cthe shared commitment to strengthen border security as well as combat the harm caused by fentanyl to save Canadian and American lives.\u201d",
      "Comeau said Lutnick and Burgum agreed to relay the information to Trump.",
      "A senior Canadian official, however, said the Americans remain preoccupied on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and want it to shrink. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.",
      "Trump has made an issue of the U.S. trade deficit, erroneously calling it a subsidy.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue.",
      "The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d said Trump\u2019s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice for solicitor general.",
      "The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.",
      "He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.",
      "He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.",
      "The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.",
      "Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and \u201cseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\u201d",
      "In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on \u201calleged \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise control\u201d over TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.",
      "The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok\u2019s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks.",
      "In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok \u201cis integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,\u201d its corporate structure carries with it risk."

      "WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her agency will need to start taking \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling, as early as January 14, in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon.",
      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling \u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government\u2019s ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Joe Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation\u2019s debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \u201cAnything else is a betrayal of our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \u201cTreasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations. And the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic pushed up government borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security.",
      "Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House and Senate in the new year, have big plans to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and other priorities but debate over how to pay for them."

      "529 college savings plans are powerful tools to help pay for the mounting costs of an education",
      "529 college savings plans \u202fare powerful tools to help pay for the mounting costs of an education. Why are some people hesitant to use them?",
      "One common concern is oversaving. You can use 529 funds to cover only\u202f qualified education expenses \u202fwithout incurring a tax penalty, but it can be hard to pinpoint how much money you actually need.",
      "Many parents open 529s for their children when they are born; they have no way of knowing whether their kids will earn a scholarship or even go to college at all. Fortunately, parents of multiple children can change the beneficiary of a 529 plan.",
      "But what do you do if you still have money left over after covering education expenses?",
      "Thanks to\u202f Secure 2.0, college savers won\u2019t have to worry about overfunding their 529s. Starting this year, you can now\u202f roll over unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA. But don\u2019t think the 529 rollover is a loophole to save extra for retirement; there are rules that limit the conversions.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should consider when converting your 529 funds to a Roth IRA.",
      "The Roth IRA receiving the funds must be in the name of the 529 plan beneficiary.",
      "The 529 plan must be open for at least 15 years.",
      "You cannot convert 529 contributions made within the past five years (or the earnings on those contributions).",
      "The 529 funds you roll over count toward your IRA annual contribution limit.",
      "You can move a maximum of $35,000 from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA during your lifetime.",
      "529 funds must be converted by paying the amount directly to a Roth IRA\u2014you can\u2019t pay yourself and then deposit the money into the Roth IRA later.",
      "You can contribute to a Roth IRA only if you have earnings from a job, so the 529 beneficiary must have eligible earnings when the 529-to-IRA conversions occur.",
      "Roth IRA income limits do not apply to 529 rollovers.",
      "While avoiding the\u202f Roth IRA \u202fincome limits is a retirement-saving perk for those with higher income, the rest of the rules around rolling over your excess 529 funds are designed to ensure that people are using 529 plans for their intended purpose: education. The annual contribution limits as well as the lifetime cap on conversions mean that you can\u2019tdouble up on your retirement funding.",
      "So, what\u2019s the bottom line?",
      "The ability to convert unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA can help alleviate potential concerns about oversaving for education. Still, don\u2019t count on your 529 as a means to save for retirement. Instead, consider funding your Roth IRA separately.",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- An online spat between factions of Donald Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House.",
      "The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump's movement \u2014 wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry \u2014 and people in Trump's Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies.",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump\u2019s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \u201cnot America First policy\u201d and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers.",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "\u201cThere is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,\" he said in a post. \u201cIt is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\u201d",
      "Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement.",
      "His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "Trump's businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers.",
      "During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\" and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cI think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" he told the \u201cAll-In\" podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.",
      "Those comments came on the cusp of Trump's budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes."

      "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people\u2019s lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home now when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat \u2014 large banks of batteries",
      "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people's lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat \u2014 large banks of batteries.",
      "This ability to store large amounts of electricity in batteries was essentially nonexistent a decade ago, but the country had about 24 gigawatt-hours operating as of the end of November, up a whopping 71% over the same date in 2023.",
      "This is welcome news to clean energy advocates including Dariella Rodriguez. She has seen what happens on days when demand for air conditioning or heating spikes and extra power plants fueled by natural gas, located in Port Morris and Mott Haven, fire up not far from where she works in Hunts Point in the South Bronx, New York.",
      "Batteries can jolt into service, sending electricity onto overhead wires, instead of these dirty \u201cpeaker\u201d plants. Rodriguez hasn't seen that transition yet, but she hopes to.",
      "\u201cThe people that are exposed to these plants are the most vulnerable people in environmental justice communities already,\u201d said Rodriguez, a director at THE POINT Community Development Corporation there, noting that lower-income people and communities of color often live near peakers.",
      "The nation\u2019s 1,000 peaker plants can be very dirty, inefficient and expensive, according to an analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a watchdog group that works for the U.S. Congress. Some 63 million people are estimated to live within a three-mile radius of one.",
      "Although peakers run only a small part of the time, they release more harmful nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide per unit of energy, the agency said. Those two pollutants cause asthma and other breathing problems.",
      "Peakers also release more greenhouse gases than other power plants do per unit of electricity.",
      "Batteries are \u201ca really obvious solution\u201d to reducing need for peakers, says Daniel Chu, senior energy planner for the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance.",
      "Storing extra power in batteries also extends the hours of the day that you can use clean energy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not always sunny, the wind\u2019s not always blowing, but energy storage can help move that generation to when it\u2019s most needed,\u201d said Tim Fox, managing director at research firm ClearView Energy Partners.",
      "That's why at least half of battery storage facilities in the U.S. are co-located with, or in some other way support solar, an AP analysis of Energy Information Administration data shows. The amount of solar energy in the U.S. is growing and surpassed the 100-gigawatt mark this year.",
      "Another way that the addition of these batteries is helpful to the American electrical grid and grids around the world is that forecasting is getting more difficult.",
      "\u201cWith weather patterns changing, the old ways of essentially figuring out how much capacity you need on the grid for extreme events just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Oliver Garnett, director of energy services product at the technology company Fermata Energy.",
      "Last, global electricity demand is slated to increase \u2014 by about one-third to three-quarters by 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration. Data centers for artificial intelligence, switching vehicles to electricity and population growth are all contributing.",
      "\u201c\u2018Do we have enough power plants?\u2019 is the classic question every utility asks every year,\u201d said Mike Jacobs, senior energy analyst at the science nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThe beauty of the batteries is that if there\u2019s energy in them, they can be used for unexpected needs.\u201d",
      "Otherwise, if utilities have to find more power generation, they may keep investing in plants that burn gas or coal and account for one-quarter of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, instead of retiring them.",
      "Leading the charge for adding new batteries to the grid this year was California with more than 11 gigawatt-hours operating. One way to think about this is roughly the amount of electricity that a nuclear power plant would put out over 11 hours. Then the batteries would need to be recharged to do the same thing again. It's a limited, but meaningful amount of power. In Texas, 6 gigawatt-hours were online. Arizona saw nearly 2 gigawatt-hours humming and Nevada \u2014 the fourth-largest deployer of storage in the U.S. \u2014 had 1.1 gigawatt-hours operational.",
      "Yet many states aren't using storage yet. As of November, 86% of large-scale battery storage in the U.S. was operating in just those four states.",
      "Some states haven't set targets telling utilities to go out and build or buy energy storage on their own. Only 18 states have 50 megawatt-hours or more operating.",
      "Others don't have as much clean electricity to pair with the batteries, or claim storage isn\u2019t reliable in times of crisis. It can also be challenging to connect storage to the grid. Still, experts expect more momentum.",
      "Especially in California and Texas, \u201cThat investment and that experiment is paying off very well,\u201d said John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis at American Clean Power.",
      "\u201cThe word is getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re increasingly seeing the technology move to other parts of the country.\u201d",

      "After three months without anyone winning the top prize, a ticket worth an estimated $1.22 billion was sold in California for the drawing Friday night. The high number evoked headlines and likely lured more people to convenience stores with dreams of private spacewalks above the Earth.",

      "Here's brief history of lotteries and why jackpots are growing:",
      "Cohen notes in his book that lotteries have existed in one form or another for more than 4,000 years.",
      "In Rome, emperors and nobles held drawings at dinner parties and awarded prizes that ranged from terra cotta vases to people who were enslaved. As early as the 1400s, lotteries were used in Europe to fund city defenses and other public works.",
      "Sweepstakes were common in the American colonies, helping to pay for the revolution against Britain. Cohen noted in his book that Thomas Jefferson approved of lotteries, writing that they were a tax \u201claid on the willing only.\u201d",
      "Lotteries began to fall out of favor in the U.S. in the 1800s because of concerns over fraud, mismanagement and impacts on poor people. But starting in the 1960s, states began to legalize them to help address financial shortfalls without raising taxes.",
      "\u201cLotteries were seen as budgetary miracles, the chance for states to make revenue appear seemingly out of thin air,\u201d Cohen wrote.",
      "When Mega Millions started in 1996, it was called \u201cThe Big Game\u201d and involved only six states. It was meant to compete with Powerball, which then had 20 states and the District of Columbia.",

      "In 2024 dollars, the before-taxes prize could buy a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution or cover Michael Soroka's $9 million contract to pitch next season for the Washington Nationals.",
      "By contrast, the pre-tax winnings from Friday\u2019s Mega Millions prize could theoretically buy a Major League Baseball team. The Nationals would be too expensive. But Forbes recently valued the Miami Marlins at $1 billion.",

      "Most winners don't turn out like him, Cohen said.",
      "\u201cEven if we deny it, we all sort of believe in the meritocracy \u2014 this belief that if you won your money through luck, then you probably didn\u2019t actually deserve it,\u201d Cohen said.

      "Stocks are closing lower as Wall Street ends a holiday-shortened week on a down note",
      "NEW YORK -- Stocks fell broadly on Friday as Wall Street closed out a holiday-shortened week on a down note.",
      "The losses were made worse by sharp declines for the Big Tech stocks known as the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d, which can heavily influence the direction of the market because of their large size.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 66.75 points, or 1.1%, to 5,970.84. Roughly 90% of stocks in the benchmark index lost ground, but it managed to hold onto a modest gain of 0.7% for the week.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 333.59 points, or 0.8%, to 42,992.21. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 298.33 points, or 1.5%, to 19,722.03.",
      "Semiconductor giant Nvidia slumped 2.1%. Microsoft declined 1.7%. Each has a market value above $3 trillion, giving the companies outsized sway on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.",
      "A wide range of retailers also fell. Amazon fell 1.5% and Best Buy slipped 1.5%. The sector is being closely watched for clues on how it performed during the holiday shopping season.",
      "Energy stocks held up better than the rest of the market, with a loss of less than 0.1% as crude oil prices rose.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just some uncertainty over this relief rally we\u2019ve witnessed since last week,\u201d said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.",
      "The S&P 500 gained nearly 3% over a 3-day stretch before breaking for the Christmas holiday. On Thursday, the index posted a small decline.",
      "Despite Friday's drop, the market is moving closer to another standout annual finish. The S&P 500 is on track for a gain of around 25% in 2024. That would mark a second consecutive yearly gain of more than 20%, the first time that has happened since 1997-1998.",
      "The gains have been driven partly by upbeat economic data showing that consumers continued spending and the labor market remained strong. Inflation, while still high, has also been steadily easing.",
      "A report on Friday showed that sales and inventory estimates for the wholesales trade industry fell 0.2% in November, following a slight gain in October. That weaker-than-expected report follows an update on the labor market Thursday that showed unemployment benefits held steady last week.",
      "The stream of upbeat economic data and easing inflation helped prompt a reversal in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy this year. Expectations for interest rate cuts also helped drive market gains. The central bank recently delivered its third cut to interest rates in 2024.",
      "Even though inflation has come closer to the central bank's target of 2%, it remains stubbornly above that mark and worries about it heating up again have tempered the forecast for more interest rate cuts.",
      "Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025, which include the labor market\u2019s path ahead and shifting economic policies under incoming President Donald Trump. Worries have risen that Trump\u2019s preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt and difficulties for global trade.",

The Justice Department had sued to block the $3.3 billion deal, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",
      "The move to extend the deadline comes ahead of an expected shift in regulatory policy under Trump. The incoming administration is expected to have a more permissive approach to dealmaking and is less likely to raise antitrust concerns.",
      "In Asia, Japan\u2019s benchmark index surged as the yen remained weak against the dollar. Stocks in South Korea fell after the main opposition party voted to impeach the country\u2019s acting leader.",
      "Markets in Europe gained ground.",

      "Wall Street will have more economic updates to look forward to next week, including reports on pending home sales and home prices. There will also be reports on U.S. construction spending and snapshots of manufacturing activity."

      "WASHINGTON -- Cosmetic companies would have to take extra steps to ensure that any products containing talc are free of asbestos under a federal rule proposed Thursday.",
      "The proposal from the Food and Drug Administration and mandated by Congress is intended to reassure consumers about the safety of makeup, baby powder and other personal care products.",
      "It follows years of lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson and other companies alleging links between talc-based baby powder and cancer.",
      "Despite the lawsuits, research has found mixed evidence of a potential link between cancer and talc, although the possibility has been recognized for decades because of how it is mined.",
      "Talc is a mineral used to absorb moisture or improve the texture, feel and color of cosmetics. It is mined from underground deposits that are sometimes located near the toxic mineral asbestos. The risk of cross contamination has long been recognized by cosmetic companies.",
      "But recent FDA-sponsored testing hasn't uncovered any safety issues. Since 2021, laboratory analysis of more than 150 cosmetic samples has come back negative for asbestos, according to the FDA.",
      "Still, concerns about the risk prompted Congress to pass a 2023 law requiring the FDA to release new industry standards for asbestos testing.",
      "Dr. Linda Katz, the director of the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors, said in a statement that the agency has \u201ccarefully considered the scientific evidence and complex policy issues related to detecting and identifying asbestos in talc and talc-containing cosmetic products.\u201d",
      "\"We believe that the proposed testing techniques are appropriate methods to detect asbestos to help ensure the safety of talc-containing cosmetic products,\u201d Katz said.",

      "A J&J subsidiary has proposed paying roughly $8 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits. As part of the deal, the subsidiary would declare bankruptcy, although that proposal has been challenged in court by the Justice Department.",
      "J&J removed talc from its baby powder in the U.S. market in 2020 and then internationally in 2023. The company says it continues to stand by the safety of its products.",
      "Determining the root cause of cancer is difficult, especially in cases of ovarian cancer, which is a relatively rare form of the disease. Even large studies in thousands of women might not gather enough data to show a clear connection or definitively rule one out. The American Cancer Society says that, if there is an increased risk of cancer due to talc, \u201cit is likely to be very small.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Atlanta Falcons have run out of time to control their path to the playoffs after mismanaging the clock multiple times in an overtime loss at the Washington Commanders",
      "LANDOVER, Md. -- Raheem Morris and the Atlanta Falcons left five timeouts unused, and they may have an extended chance to linger over those mistakes.",
      "The Falcons have run out of time to control their own path to the playoffs after mismanaging the clock multiple times in a 30-24 overtime loss to the Washington Commanders. They needed a victory to set up a win-and-get-in situation in the regular-season finale, and now Tampa Bay is in the driver's seat for the NFC South title.",
      "Morris declined to use all three of his timeouts at the end of the first half before settling for a field goal. He had two left in the waning minutes of regulation before Riley Patterson tried a 56-yard field goal attempt with two seconds left that fell short.",
      "The first-year coach acknowledged he \u201cprobably could have\u201d taken one after Michael Penix Jr. connected with Darnell Mooney on a 25-yard completion with 40 seconds left. Instead, the clock wound down to 17 seconds because he was \u201ctrying to save that timeout.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn hindsight, it could have been a better decision to take that timeout, but I wanted to have the opportunity to move up there so you can always second guess those things,' Morris said after his team's defeat that punched the Commanders' ticket to the playoffs. \"Can always second-guess those motives. Can always go back and look at it to see if you could have snapped it a little quicker. But I really believe we can get our operation time a little faster and to save that timeout.\"",
      "Questionable coaching came back to bit the Falcons, including a near-total abandonment of the running game that was picking Washington apart for much of the first half. Bijan Robinson had 13 carries for 82 yards and two touchdowns until there was one minute left before halftime, and he was handed the ball just four more times for 8 yards the rest of the way.",
      "Penix, the rookie quarterback taken with the eighth pick and making his second NFL start, pointed to a three-and-out in the third quarter as the culprit behind Atlanta becoming unbalanced. The Commanders had the ball for 12:53 and the Falcons for just 2:07 in the third.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t really have the ball much,\" said Penix, who was 19 of 35 for 223 yards, a touchdown pass to Kyle Pitts and an interception. \u201cI believe we ran three plays. We just got to sustain drives. We can\u2019t go three-and-out. Our mindset each and every time we step on the field is to get points. Whenever we have the opportunity based on that, it could have made us go one way or the other passing or running the ball.\u201d",
      "The Falcons had the chance to go up 21-7 instead of 17-7 at halftime, though Morris defended his strategy as a way to not leave Jayden Daniels and Co. the chance to get the ball back: \"Took the field goal. Got out of dodge.\u201d",
      "Penix deferred to Morris on when to use timeouts.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s on Coach Raheem,\u201d Penix said. \u201cHe calls the timeouts whenever he feels fit. He trusted in us to get the plays off and make the next play. We all trust coach\u2019s judgement on that, so that\u2019s what we are going to lean on.\u201d",
      "The Falcons must now lean on New Orleans to beat Tampa Bay. After five losses in seven games, they need that and a victory against Carolina to reach the playoffs.",

      "\u201cThe playoff is out of contention, you understand what they\u2019re saying,\u201d quarterback Drew Lock said after throwing for 309 yards and four touchdowns. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s nice to say we\u2019re going to go work, we\u2019re going to keep doing this, we\u2019re going to keep pushing, the season\u2019s not over, we\u2019ve got two games left to be able to come out and win this one - that\u2019s the goal every single week, come out and win and work as hard as we can to do it.",
      "Players aren\u2019t going to tank football games. It\u2019s a violent, physical sport and it would be dangerous to play to lose. Plus, there\u2019s too much pride involved and other factors. Guys are playing for contracts and there are few job guarantees in the NFL.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously not tanking,\u201d said wide receiver Darius Slayton, who screamed an expletive about tanking after catching a 32-yard TD pass. \u201cAt the end of the day, we have a job to do. This isn\u2019t basketball, it\u2019s not golf, it\u2019s not tennis. Football, you get hit, so I\u2019m not (going to) go out there and just let people tee off on me just to tank.\u201d",
      "Getting coaches on board to play not to win would be a tough task, too. Brian Daboll has no incentive to care about draft positioning if his job status is uncertain. General manager Joe Schoen also could be fired so this decision should have come from the top. Start a third-string quarterback and bench key starters. That\u2019s how teams give themselves a better opportunity to lose.",
      "The Giants didn\u2019t do that. The repercussions of this victory could set the organization back a few years if New York doesn\u2019t end up with a franchise quarterback.",
      "That\u2019s not Daboll\u2019s concern. He breathed a sigh of relief after the Giants avoided becoming the first team to go 0-9 at home.",
      "\u201cI see these coaches every day come in and are consistent. It\u2019s hard to be consistent in an inconsistent league when things go. ... It\u2019s not great,\u201d Daboll said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a good record. I firmly acknowledge that and I accept responsibility for that. But their commitment to doing things the right way, day in and day out, staying late and putting together plans much like the players when we\u2019re down and we got two wins. We have the right kind of people. It was good to get a win at home, I\u2019ll say that. It was good to get a win at home. But it means more to me for the players and the coaches.\u201d",
      "Las Vegas, another team that needs a franchise quarterback, was in contention for the top pick before winning consecutive games. Now, the Raiders (4-12) are sitting at No. 8.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t do this to lose,\u201d Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said last week. \u201cWe don\u2019t do this for anybody\u2019s fantasy football team. Don\u2019t do this for anybody\u2019s draft projections. None of that (stuff) matters to us. What matters is winning, and that\u2019s all we want to do.\u201d",

      "The Rose Bowl between eighth-seeded Ohio State and top-seeded Oregon in a College Football Playoff quarterfinal has many subplots for Chip Kelly",
      "Of all the things Chip Kelly is looking forward to in his return trip to Southern California, there is one that rises above everything else.",
      "\u201cGotta get more sunscreen looking at the weather report, because we haven\u2019t seen the sun for a little while in Columbus,\" said Kelly with a wry smile.",
      "The eighth-seeded Buckeyes will face top-seeded Oregon on Wednesday in the Rose Bowl in a College Football Playoff quarterfinal matchup. The game in the venerable stadium is a homecoming for Kelly, who resigned from UCLA in February after six seasons to become Ohio State\u2019s offensive coordinator.",
      "Kelly had a 35-34 record with the Bruins, including 25-13 in his final three seasons. UCLA though appeared to reach its ceiling under Kelly after going 8-5 last season when it was expected to contend for a title in its final season in the Pac-12.",
      "Kelly was on the hot seat a year ago going into the Southern California game, but a 38-20 victory appeared to give him another season. But Kelly said coaching quarterbacks leading up to the LA Bowl after staff departures made him realize that he enjoyed being in the position meeting rooms more than overseeing an entire program.",
      "After pursuing a couple NFL assistant openings, Kelly decided to reunite with longtime friend Ryan Day.",
      "\"I had a great time when I was at UCLA. I had a great staff and an unbelievable group of players there, too. I think as a head coach, you wear a lot of different hats. Obviously, as a coordinator and just coaching the quarterbacks, it\u2019s a little bit different,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun. I've enjoyed being back in the meeting room with the players on a day-to-day basis. As a head coach, you bounced around to different meeting rooms, but as the coordinator, you\u2019re with the quarterbacks all the time, so I really enjoyed that aspect of it.\u201d",
      "With Kelly calling the plays, Ohio State is 11th in the nation in scoring offense, averaging 36 points, and 32nd in total offense at 427.3 yards a game.",
      "Quarterback Will Howard, tied with Oregon's Dillon Gabriel for second nationally with a 73.2% completion rate, grew up as a Philadelphia Eagles fan, where Kelly coached for two-plus seasons (2013-15). Gabriel was surprised but also thought it was cool when Kelly brought up Eagles clips to study in the quarterback room.",
      "\u201cThe more that this year has gone on, I feel like we\u2019re in sync right now. We both kind of see things the same way sometimes,\u201d said Howard, who has thrown for 29 touchdowns and nine interceptions. \u201cWe're also able to have that healthy discussion of what do you like here? What do you not like here? I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed my time working with him.\u201d",
      "Day said that he has also seen Kelly's comfort level increase as he has developed a better understanding of Ohio State's personnel as well as going through the Big Ten for the first time.",
      "Day also noted that he was happy with the Buckeyes' balance in their 42-17 victory over Tennessee in the first round Dec. 21. Howard completed 24 of 29 passes for 311 yards with two touchdowns and an interception, while the running game had 156 yards and averaged 4.7 yards per carry.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got a great understanding of the entire game of football, offensive football, whether it\u2019s wide open and spread and tempo or getting with multiple tight ends in the game, huddling, different styles of play, and he\u2019s always said, and we\u2019ve always said that the No. 1 job of the coordinator is to put the offense in the best position to be successful.\u201d",
      "Coming back to the Rose Bowl isn't the only connection Kelly has to the game. He was Oregon's head coach from 2009 through '12, and had a 46-7 record before leaving for the NFL. Kelly is winless in six games against the Ducks, including a 32-31 loss in Eugene in prime time Oct. 12.",
      "Kelly said the offensive staff has reviewed all 13 Oregon games from this season.",
      "Ducks defensive end Jordan Burch did not play in the first meeting, which is one of the biggest differences on defense. The other is that the first game took place in the middle of the season as both teams have played seven games since then.",
      "\u201cI think every game is different. It\u2019s always the matchups and the individual matchups, our offensive line versus their defensive line, which I think is one of the best lines in the country,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cOur job is to put these guys in position to make plays and then let them go play. We've got a great group from that standpoint that is a joy to coach because of how they approach every single day.\u201d",

      "The Washington Commanders clinched a playoff spot by beating the Atlanta Falcons 30-24 in overtime",
      "LANDOVER, Md. -- Jayden Daniels felt tired. Tired from a game that went well past 60 minutes. Tired from running all over the field for the better part of three-plus hours.",
      "It was all worth it after carrying the Washington Commanders into the playoffs.",
      "Daniels connected with Zach Ertz in overtime for his third touchdown pass of the game to clinch a playoff spot by beating the Atlanta Falcons 30-24 in overtime Sunday night in a back-and-forth prime-time showdown between highly drafted rookie quarterbacks.",
      "\u201cThe fan base waited a long time for this,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cI really can\u2019t put into words how much it means to them and how much it means to me to be able to go out there and lead this franchise and this team to opportunities like that.\u201d",
      "Daniels ran for a season-high 127 yards, including 42 in OT, and completed 24 of 36 passes for 227 yards and had two TD passes to Ertz and another to Olamide Zaccheaus to make the playoffs in his rookie year.",
      "In his latest comeback performance in a season full of them, the No. 2 overall pick in the draft in April shook off an interception and a 10-point halftime deficit and led the winning drive in overtime that was capped with the 2-yard pass to Ertz.",
      "\u201cYou want to be in these moments,\u201d said veteran linebacker Bobby Wagner, who saw a look in Daniels' eyes late in the game that foreshadowed another winning performance. \u201cHim getting hit and making big plays, his confidence, his demeanor never changes. You know that he knows he\u2019s going to make a play, and everybody on the sideline and on the field believes he\u2019s going to make a play.\u201d",
      "The Commanders (11-5) could move up to the sixth seed in the NFC and set up a wild-card round game at Tampa Bay or the Los Angeles Rams if they win their regular-season finale at Dallas next weekend. They otherwise would be seventh and visit division-rival Philadelphia unless Green Bay loses to Chicago.",
      "The Falcons (8-8) lost control of their chances of winning the NFC South and ensuring a home playoff game. They now need to beat Carolina and for the Buccaneers to lose to New Orleans to qualify altogether.",
      "\u201cControl what your controllables are,\u201d Atlanta coach Raheem Morris said. \u201cGo out there and win our football game. That\u2019s all we can do. Everything else is out of our control. Those things don\u2019t matter. Thing we got to do is prepare for this football game. Prepare for the Panthers.\u201d",
      "Atlanta was in control for the first half of the game, gashing Washington\u2019s defense with the running game until abandoning it. Bijan Robinson had 82 yards and two touchdown runs on 13 carries until a minute was left in the second quarter \u2014 but had just 8 yards the rest of the way.",
      "Penix did his best to try to carry the Falcons back after they fell behind 24-17 late. The eighth pick in the draft made his second professional start and finished a 12-play, 68-yard drive with a touchdown pass to Kyle Pitts to tie it with 1:19 left.",
      "A throw from Penix to Drake London drew a pass interference penalty with 2 seconds left in regulation and gave Riley Patterson a chance at a go-ahead field goal. But Patterson's 56-yard attempt fell short as time expired and Atlanta never got the ball back.",
      "\u201cWe just went back to our technique and fundamentals: Keep it simple for stopping the run and keep it on the passing game,\u201d Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu said. \u201cShout out to the quarterback, man. He threw a couple balls at the end of the game. He\u2019s a hell of a player, man, and pulse of that team and they fought. It\u2019s always a fight with them.\"",
      "Penix finished 19 of 35 for 223 yards with the TD pass and an interception.",
      "Daniels has 30 combined touchdowns and tied Russell Wilson for the third most by a rookie QB and passed Robert Griffin III for the most yards rushing with 864. ... Ertz became the ninth tight end in NFL history to eclipse 8,000 yards receiving. ... London had seven catches for 106 yards to reach 1,000 for the first time in his career.",
      "Washington lost starting center Tyler Biadasz to a left ankle injury when he was rolled up on during a running play late in the second quarter that was negated by a holding penalty on left tackle Brandon Coleman. ...

      "Thompson and Herro became entangled with Miami about to inbound the ball leading 99-94 with 35 seconds left. Thompson grabbed Herro by the jersey and tossed him, with referee Marc Davis describing it as Thompson \u201cbody slams Herro.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see it live, but I re-watched it,\u201d Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. \u201cThey were in each other\u2019s face, bumping chests a little bit, and one guy\u2019s stronger than the other.\u201d",
      "Herro, Thompson, and Udoka were ejected, as were Heat guard Terry Rozier, Rockets guard Jalen Green, and Rockets assistant coach Ben Sullivan.",
      "Davis said Green and Rozier escalated the altercation, while Sullivan was assessed a technical foul and ejected for unsportsmanlike comments as the referee was trying to redirect the Rockets' Alperen Sengun.",

      "Houston's Fred VanVleet had been ejected just before the fight, with Davis saying VanVleet made contact with him after being called for a 5-second violation.",
      "The win for Miami came 24 hours after losing 120-110 in Atlanta. The Heat were missing second-leading scorer Jimmy Butler for a fifth straight game, so Herro was proud of his team played against one of NBA\u2019s best teams this season.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re top two, three in the West,\u201d Herro said. \u201cVery good defense. Got a bunch of young, athletic guys that can really play, so that\u2019s a good win for us. That\u2019s a stepping stone. We go 2-1 on the road. Put ourselves in a position to win yesterday, and I like how it\u2019s going. We just got to continue to keep getting better.\u201d"

      "Sam Darnold added another exploit to his career-altering season, passing for a personal-best 377 yards and three touchdowns as the Minnesota Vikings hung on to beat the Green Bay Packers 27-25 for their ninth consecutive victory",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Vikings were ready to start their postgame ritual in honor of a ninth consecutive victory before realizing Sam Darnold was still missing from the raucous locker room because he was finishing his interview with the TV broadcasting crew.",
      "He was well worth the wait, on so many levels.",
      "Darnold added another exploit to his career-altering season, passing for a personal-best 377 yards and three touchdowns as the Vikings hung on to beat the Green Bay Packers 27-25 on Sunday and moved tantalizingly close to the NFC's top seed for the playoffs.",
      "\u201cJust to see how he's ultimately been able to maximize everything about his opportunity, our football team loves him for it,\u201d coach Kevin O'Connell said. \u201cI've had an absolute blast coaching him.\u201d",
      "The Vikings (14-2) set up a final-week showdown in Detroit next Sunday night for both the NFC North title and the first-round-bye-plus-home-field-advantage package that comes with the best record in the conference, finishing 7-1 at U.S. Bank Stadium where their blitz-fueled defense has fed well off the deafening crowd.",
      "\u201cPlaying here, our opponents feel that,\u201d said linebacker Blake Cashman, who had a team-leading 11 tackles and 1\u00bd sacks to help keep Packers quarterback Jordan Love from ever finding a rhythm.",
      "Darnold hit Jalen Nailor, Jordan Addison and Cam Akers for scores to raise his passing touchdown total to 35, the fourth-most in NFL history by a player in his debut season with a team.",
      "When Darnold jogged into the locker room after his interview with, of all people, Tom Brady, the seven-time Super Bowl champion and now the lead analyst on Fox, he was doused in water by his teammates and hoisted in the air.",
      "\u201cIt was just mayhem,\u201d Darnold said, smiling wide. \u201cI think I blacked out when Aaron Jones grabbed me and lifted me up.\u201d",
      "Love\u2019s only touchdown pass for the Packers (11-5) came with 2:18 left, a 3-yard toss to Malik Heath that trimmed their deficit to two points and reignited the \u201cGo Pack Go!\u201d chants from the green-clad fans mixed in among the purple in another classic edition of this divisional rivalry.",
      "Despite another fierce climb out of a gaping hole against Minnesota this season, following a 31-29 loss in Green Bay on Sept. 29 that started with a 28-0 deficit, the Packers fell to a troubling 0-5 against the top three teams in the NFC.",
      "\u201cWe know what type of team we are,\u201d Love said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of stuff to clean up.\u201d",
      "The Packers were swept by the Lions, too, and lost their opener in Brazil to the Eagles.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t sit up here and say, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re on the same level,' if we ain\u2019t beat them,\u201d safety Xavier McKinney said. \u201cWe've got to be more on our details. We've got to play cleaner. We've got to start faster.\u201d",
      "Josh Jacobs and Emanuel Wilson rushed for second-half touchdowns to fuel the late surge by the Packers after Will Reichard\u2019s second missed field goal of the game for the Vikings with 9:18 remaining prevented them from pushing the lead to 20.",
      "But with the score too close for comfort and the Packers holding all their timeouts before the two-minute warning, O'Connell didn't hesitate to trust Darnold to win it.",
      "Darnold ran bootlegs for completions for two vital first downs, one to fullback C.J. Ham and one on third-and-2 that Akers snagged just before it hit the turf to force the Packers to use their final timeout. On the play before that, Darnold hit Justin Jefferson in tight coverage for 9 yards on another rollout.",
      "\u201cWe can be aggressive, but he's still going to be a great decision-maker,\u201d O'Connell said. \u201cHe's playing quarterback at a very, very high level.\u201d",
      "Darnold went 33 for 43 with one interception as the Vikings ran 70 plays for 441 yards, their second-highest total of the season.",
      "He passed Brett Favre (33, Vikings, 2009) and Vinny Testaverde (33, Ravens, 1996) for fourth place in touchdown passes in a debut season. The third overall pick in the 2018 draft by the Jets trails only Matthew Stafford (41, Rams, 2021), Brady (40, Buccaneers, 2020) and Peyton Manning (37, Broncos, 2012). Stafford and Brady won the Super Bowl those years. Manning is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.",
      "Packers: WR Christian Watson (knee) was inactive. LB Quay Walker (ankle) missed his second straight game and CB Jaire Alexander (knee) was sidelined for the sixth consecutive game and the ninth time this season. ... Two backups, FS Zayne Anderson and DE Brenton Cox, entered the concussion protocol during the game and did not return.",
      "Vikings: Jones (quadriceps) was pulled in the fourth quarter as a precaution, O'Connell said. ... OLB Patrick Jones (knee) limped off after Packers TE Tucker Kraft delivered a low, diving block that drew loud boos after the replay was shown on the video board but no penalty.",

      "When LeBron James broke another NBA record earlier this month, the one for most regular-season minutes played in a career, his Los Angeles Lakers teammates handled the moment in typical locker room fashion.",
      "They made fun of him.",
      "\u201cThey told me I\u2019m old as hell,\u201d James quipped.",
      "By NBA standards, they\u2019re not wrong. He was dubbed \u201cThe Kid from Akron\u201d when the Ohio native entered the league with a limitless future nearly 22 years ago. He's now the 40-year-old from Los Angeles with wisps of gray in his beard. His milestone birthday comes Monday, one that will make him the first player in NBA history to play in his teens, 20s, 30s and 40s.",
      "Such a feat has happened a couple of dozen times in baseball before. It has happened in hockey \u2014 Gordie Howe was a five-decade player, appearing in the NHL from his teens to his 50s \u2014 but never in the NFL or the NBA. Until now. James is making more basketball history and creating a club all of his own.",
      "\u201cIn some ways he\u2019s a freak of nature,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a lot of great players and he\u2019s one of the hardest-working players I\u2019ve been around. I mean, he doesn\u2019t take a day off. He seems to not take an afternoon off. He\u2019s always working on some part of his body. You meet with him and he\u2019s always soaking something or eating something with some contraption attached to him.\u201d",
      "A 40th birthday, in NBA terms, means the on-court end is near. James will become the 30th player to appear in a regular-season game with a \u201c4\u201d as the first digit of his age; only nine logged more than 51 games after that birthday. He\u2019ll be the 32nd player to play after turning 40 overall; Tim Duncan and Danny Schayes both turned 40 during playoff runs in what became their final seasons.",
      "And for the most part, big numbers are largely nonexistent at that age.",
      "Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who did it three times), John Stockton (twice), Michael Jordan, Robert Parish and Karl Malone have averaged more than 10 points in a season after turning 40. Jordan averaged 22.4 points in 30 games after turning 40 in his final season with Washington; Malone is the most recent to do it, averaging 13.2 points in 42 games after turning 40 while with the Lakers in 2003-04.",
      "James, meanwhile, is still putting up All-Star level numbers: 23.5 points, 9 assists and 7.5 rebounds per game. Forget how doing that at 40 is unheard of. Doing that at 30 is practically unheard of. The only players to have those numbers in all three categories in a season after turning 30 are James (who did it at 33 and 35) and James Harden (who did it at 31).",
      "\u201cThe size, the strength and the IQ \u2026 with his frame and the way he takes care of himself, he doesn\u2019t have to be the best athlete on the planet. At one time he was,\u201d Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the best athlete in the association. He was the best athlete on the planet arguably, just size, strength, agility, explosiveness combined. But at this size and if he just wants to slow the game down and just play off his brain and IQ, he could do that for another decade. I doubt he\u2019ll find interest in that. But he could.\u201d",
      "Nobody knows when James will stop playing. And it surely isn't going to get any easier: James wanted to play all 82 games this season and couldn't, was widely criticized when the Lakers went through a slump earlier this season and took tons of backlash when his team drafted his son Bronny in the second round last summer in what many thought was simple nepotism.",
      "He has always been a lightning rod. If his play declines at 40, his naysayers will be lined up to revel in that.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder, physically and emotionally, to face what those guys face night after night after night,\" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said of top NBA stars getting up in years, like James and the Warriors' Stephen Curry \u2014 who'll turn 37 in March. \"There\u2019s a reason players have to retire. You know, they can\u2019t do it forever.\u201d",
      "James won't either.",
      "But even while playing alongside elite 30-year-olds like Giannis Antetokounmpo, James \u2014 who reportedly spends more than $1.5 million annually on his fitness and has an on-site mechanic of sorts at all times for anything his body needs in personal athletic training guru in Mike Mancias \u2014 has shown how to play long past what used to be considered an NBA player\u2019s peak years.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s done is incredible, never been done, especially at the level he\u2019s playing,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cFor me, I always look at the other players that kind of set the blueprint for us, and this is something that\u2019s never been done before. I definitely want to play late into my career, like 37, 38, 39, as much as my body can allow me to play. But I have to do a good job of taking care of my body, which I believe I do, but he kind of set the path for us, set the blueprint for us. We\u2019ve just got to follow.\"",
      "The accolades are countless: James is the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring leader, has a place in the GOAT conversation, most minutes played, four NBA championships, three Olympic gold medals, 20 and likely soon to be 21 All-Star selections, oldest to do this, oldest to do that, generational wealth with a net worth exceeding $1 billion, and on and on and on.",
      "It begs the question: What does one get a 40-year-old who has everything?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even know,\u201d lamented Bronny James \u2014 another example of how James is one of one, becoming the first dad in NBA history to have his son as a teammate.",
      "James has hinted that the end is near. \u201cDon\u2019t make me feel old right now,\u201d he said, only half-kiddingly, when asked earlier this month about the looming 40th birthday. He is under contract for next season but hasn\u2019t offered any guarantees about how long he will play, saying he isn\u2019t \u201cgoing to play that much longer, to be completely honest\u201d and insisting that he won\u2019t be \u201cplaying till the wheels fall off\u201d because he doesn\u2019t want to disrespect the game.",
      "No player scored more points in his teens than James did. Same goes for his 20s. Only Malone and Abdul-Jabbar scored more points in their 30s than James. And now, here comes his 40s, with James still going strong.",
      "It's the final decade of a basketball career like none other.",
      "\u201cFans pay attention every time he steps on the court because they\u2019re watching one of the greatest ever and still playing an incredibly high level, despite turning 40 this month,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI marvel at him.\u201d",

      "The former world No. 1, who is chasing a record 25th Grand Slam title at next month\u2019s Australian Open, expressed his frustration Sunday at being \u201ckept in the dark\u201d regarding top-ranked Jannik Sinner\u2019s doping case.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue.",
      "The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d said Trump\u2019s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice for solicitor general.",
      "The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.",
      "He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.",
      "He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.",
      "The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.",
      "Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and \u201cseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\u201d",
      "In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on \u201calleged \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise control\u201d over TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.",
      "The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok\u2019s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks.",
      "In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok \u201cis integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,\u201d its corporate structure carries with it risk."

      "Loomer declared the stance to be \u201cnot America First policy\u201d and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers.",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "\u201cThere is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,\" he said in a post. \u201cIt is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\u201d",
      "Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement.",
      "His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "Trump's businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers.",
      "During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\" and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cI think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" he told the \u201cAll-In\" podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.",
      "Those comments came on the cusp of Trump's budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes."

      "WASHINGTON -- A ninth U.S. telecoms firm has been confirmed to have been hacked as part of a sprawling Chinese espionage campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, a top White House official said Friday.",
      "Biden administration officials said this month that at least eight telecommunications companies, as well as dozens of nations, had been affected by the Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon.",
      "But deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told reporters Friday that a ninth victim had been identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks.",
      "The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that has alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication.",
      "The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of what officials have said is a a limited number of individuals. Though the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose whose communications were accessed.",
      "Neuberger said Friday that officials did not yet have a precise sense how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but that a \u201clarge number\" were in the Washington-Virginia area.",
      "Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were \u201cgovernment targets of interest,\u201d spy on their texts and phone calls, she said.",
      "The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are \"primarily involved in government or political activity.\u201d",
      "Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. In addition, she said, the government was planning additional actions in coming weeks in response to the hacking campaign, though she did not say what they were.",
      "\u201cWe know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say human-caused climate change added an average of 41 days of dangerous heat worldwide in 2024",
      "People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world's damaging weather throughout 2024.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central researchers comes at the end of a year that shattered climate record after climate record as heat across the globe made 2024 likely to be its hottest ever measured and a slew of other fatal weather events spared few.",
      "\u201cThe finding is devastating but utterly unsurprising: Climate change did play a role, and often a major role in most of the events we studied, making heat, droughts, tropical cyclones and heavy rainfall more likely and more intense across the world, destroying lives and livelihoods of millions and often uncounted numbers of people,\u201d Friederike Otto, the lead of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College climate scientist, said during a media briefing on the scientists' findings. \u201cAs long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, this will only get worse.\u201d",
      "Millions of people endured stifling heat this year. Northern California and Death Valley baked. Sizzling daytime temperatures scorched Mexico and Central America. Heat endangered already vulnerable children in West Africa. Skyrocketing southern European temperatures forced Greece to close the Acropolis. In South and Southeast Asian countries, heat forced school closures. Earth experienced some of the hottest days ever measured and its hottest-yet summer, with a 13-month heat streak that just barely broke.",
      "To do its heat analysis, the team of volunteer international scientists compared daily temperatures around the globe in 2024 to the temperatures that would have been expected in a world without climate change. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, but researchers use peer-reviewed methods.",
      "Some areas saw 150 days or more of extreme heat due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe poorest, least developed countries on the planet are the places that are experiencing even higher numbers,\u201d said Kristina Dahl, vice president of climate science at Climate Central.",
      "What's worse, heat-related deaths are often underreported.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to die in heat waves. But if we can\u2019t communicate convincingly, \u2018but actually a lot of people are dying,\u2019 it\u2019s much harder to raise this awareness,\u201d Otto said. \u201cHeat waves are by far the deadliest extreme event, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real game changer.\u201d",
      "This year was a warning that the planet is getting dangerously close to the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit compared to the pre-industrial average, according to the scientists. Earth is expected to soon edge past that threshold, although it's not considered to have been breached until that warming is sustained over decades.",
      "The researchers closely examined 29 extreme weather events this year that killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions, and found that 26 of them had clear links to climate change.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather around the world, made some of this weather more likely earlier in the year. But the researchers said most of their studies found that climate change played a bigger role than that phenomenon in fueling 2024's events. Warm ocean waters and warmer air fueled more destructive storms, according to the researchers, while temperatures led to many record-breaking downpours.",
      "Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, said the science and findings were sound.",
      "\u201cExtreme weather will continue to become more frequent, intense, destructive, costly, and deadly, until we can lower the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere,\" she said.",
      "Significantly more climate extremes could be expected without action, the United Nations Environment Programme said in the fall, as more planet-warming carbon dioxide has been sent into the air this year by burning fossil fuels than last year.",
      "But the deaths and damages from extreme weather events aren't inevitable, said Julie Arrighi, director of programmes at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and part of the research.",
      "\u201cCountries can reduce those impacts by preparing for climate change and adapting for climate change, and while the challenges faced by individual countries or systems or places vary around the world, we do see that every country has a role to play,\" she said.",

      "Under South Korea's constitution, if a sitting president is accused of insurrection, the police have the authority to arrest him while he is still in office.",
      "The court's decision to grant the warrant marks the first for a president in the country's history.",
      "Immediately after the request, Yoon\u2019s attorneys asked the court to dismiss it, claiming that the headquarters \"does not have the authority to investigate an insurrection\" and that declaring martial law was constitutional.",
      "Yoon declared martial law in a televised speech on Dec. 3. The president said the measure was necessary due to the actions of the country's liberal opposition, the Democratic Party, which he accused of controlling parliament, sympathizing with North Korea and paralyzing the government.",
      "The move sparked protests, and hours after the declaration, the National Assembly voted to demand that the president lift the martial law order. A majority of parliament -- all 190 members who were present, out of the 300-person body -- voted to lift the decree -- requiring that it then be lifted, under the South Korean constitution.",

      "Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt,\u201d Simon said in a statement. \u201cShe and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\u201d",
      "No court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitt's attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood\u2019s most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019 declared them divorced and single, but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.",
      "A private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.",
      "No details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couple's use of the private judge \u2014 an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years \u2014 has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit."

      "WASHINGTON and LONDON -- President Joe Biden announced on Monday that the United States would offer almost $2.5 billion in defense assistance to Ukraine, a move that will bring an \"immediate influx of capabilities\" as the country defends itself against Russia's assault.",
      "\"At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine's position in this war over the remainder of my time in office,\" Biden said in a statement.",
      "The support will include both a $1.25 billion drawdown package for Ukraine's military and a $1.22 billion package authorized through the U.S. Department of Defense's Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, according to Biden.

    "summary": "Jimmy Carter's legacy lives on through Habitat for Humanity, says those who volunteered with him.",
    "story": [
      "Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter were the organization's most high-profile supporters.",
      "President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at 100, is leaving an enduring legacy in one of the causes he spent decades working on and cherished most, according to those who volunteered with him.",
      "Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, had been \"been champions and groundbreaking voices for affordable, decent housing for all\" since 1984, according to Habitat for Humanity. The Carters donated their time and influence and worked with nearly 103,000 volunteers in 14 countries to build, renovate and repair 4,331 homes, the nonprofit stated.",
      "Rhode Island-based builder and designer Kenneth Young, 66, first began volunteering with Habitat for Humanity in the 1990s. After his first \"Carter build\" in 1995 in Watts, California, a neighborhood in southern Los Angeles, he \"got the bug,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Since then, Young has carried out 20 builds, many alongside the 39th president of the United States -- including Carter's last build in Nashville in 2019, Young said.",
      "Young's favorite memory of Carter was during a build in Budapest, Hungary, in 1996, when the residents of a newly built home -- twin boy toddlers -- smacked him in the face with a balloon and Carter, a grandfather himself, \"took in it stride\" and with a smile.",
      "\"It was classic,\" Young said.",
      "Don Shaw and Thomas Trumble -- lifelong friends who have been volunteering together for decades with the Habitat for Humanity chapter in Hartford, Connecticut, first worked with Carter in 2002 during a build in Durban, South Africa, they told ABC News.",
      "Much of the focus of the build was reconciliation from apartheid, and the project was part of Carter's aim to build 1,000 homes in Africa, Shaw said.",
      "Shaw and Trumble went on to join Carter on builds in Mexico, India, Thailand, Canada and twice in Haiti, they said. They were also with Carter during his last build in Nashville.",
      "The volunteers were often on a first-name basis with Carter, who made them feel like they were part of his \"inner-circle,\" Shaw said.",
      "Although Carter's celebrity and political status often brought a media circus and extra funding, the former president also knew how to get his hands dirty, the volunteers said.",
      "On the job site, Carter was a natural leader, Young said.",
      "Carter's presence alone was enough inspire everyone to work hard and efficiently. The builds run by the Carters were \"a logistical miracle,\" Shaw said, adding that it was often astonishing to see how many homes the group could build within a mere week.",
      "\"President Carter, also being a Navy man, and having that military background., he wants it right. He wants it done properly. And he wants it on time,\" Young said.",
      "Shaw nicknamed Carter the \"benevolent taskmaster,\" he said.",
      "\"President Carter was all about getting the job done,\" Shaw said. \"I can remember him going around the site saying, \"No photos, no photos. We've got houses to build. Get back.\"",
      "After an eight-hour work day, the volunteers would come together under a huge camp and share a meal, Trumble said.",
      "One of Carter's favorite rituals was to walk into the completed homes to hand the new occupants the keys and a Bible, Young said.",
      "\"He really cares about the people that we're building for,\" Young said.",
      "Carter will be sorely missed, the volunteers said.",
      "\"God knows we're all going to miss President Carter when when he leaves us, but I'm hoping his legacy will continue quite a long way forward,\" Young said.",
      "Shaw said, \"Being around the Carters was just magical.\"",

    "summary": "Jimmy Carter's dedication to international humanitarian work earned him a Nobel Peace Prize and serves as a centerpiece of his legacy.",
    "story": [
      "He and his wife founded the Carter Center after they left the White House.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter earned a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 which, at the time, seemed to cap his decades of dedication to international humanitarian work after leaving the White House.",
      "Instead, he continued to work for years after -- a legacy that is drawing renewed attention in the wake of his death at age 100.",
      "After serving one term as president and losing his reelection bid to Ronald Reagan, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, founded an eponymous organization in Georgia dedicated to conflict resolution and advancing human rights, public health and democracy around the world.",
      "The Carter Center, the main vehicle for the Carters' work, was founded in 1982, the year after he left the White House.",
      "Jimmy Carter's advocacy for peaceful resolutions to global conflicts helped burnish his reputation as a global statesman, a commitment he underscored when receiving the Nobel on Dec. 10, 2002.",
      "\"War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children,\" he said then.",
      "The center's website declares that it is guided by the principles of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, including, \"a fundamental commitment to human rights and the alleviation of human suffering\" while \"seek[ing] to prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health.\"",
      "Since its founding, the center has established programs across the globe, focusing both on democracy promotion and public engagement with government as well as global health.",
      "Among other accomplishments, the center highlights work monitoring 113 elections across 39 countries. Specifically, the center recently observed elections in Myanmar, Bolivia, the Ivory Coast, Guyana, Tunisia and Nepal and currently runs projects to expand women's access to information in Liberia, Bangladesh and Guatemala.",
      "Elsewhere, the center is \"supporting a human rights-based approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\" working to implement a 2015 peace agreement in Mali and ameliorate the humanitarian crisis in Syria, the type of work that led to Jimmy Carter's Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.",
      "\"What I derive from this is a commitment to peace, to the honoring of international law,\" Jimmy Carter said on Oct. 11, 2002 after he was announced as the prize's winner that year.",
      "Building off of Jimmy Carter's success in the White House in establishing a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, the center ultimately became a diplomatic broker outside of the government's official channels, with the former president himself meeting world leaders in places like North Korea, where in 1994 he helped establish a pact between Washington and Pyongyang on nuclear issues.",
      "Besides democracy promotion and conflict resolution, the center has also long been involved in several global health programs, including fighting Guinea worm, river blindness, trachoma, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis and malaria.",
      "\"We believe access to health care is a human right, especially among poor people afflicted with disease who are forgotten, ignored, and often without hope,\" Jimmy Carter said in a quote featured on the center's website. \"Just to know that someone cares about them not only can ease their physical pain but also remove an element of alienation and anger that can lead to hatred and violence.\"",
      "Those efforts helped lead to the unanimous decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2002 to award the peace prize to the former president.",
      "At the time, he lamented the growing global wealth disparity, linking it to many of the world's greatest challenges.",
      "\"Among all the possible choices, I decided that the most serious and universal problem is the growing chasm between the richest and poorest people on earth. Citizens of the ten wealthiest countries are now seventy-five times richer than those who live in the ten poorest ones, and the separation is increasing every year, not only between nations but also within them,\" he said in 2002.",
      "\"The results of this disparity are root causes of most of the world's unresolved problems, including starvation, illiteracy, environmental degradation, violent conflict, and unnecessary illnesses that range from Guinea worm to HIV/AIDS.\"",
      "Besides working through his center, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter worked for decades with Habitat for Humanity, often volunteering themselves to help build homes for those in need.",
      "\"Habitat provides a simple but powerful avenue for people of different backgrounds to come together to achieve those most meaningful things in life,\" Jimmy Carter once said. \"A decent home, yes, but also a genuine bond with our fellow human beings. A bond that comes with the building up of walls and the breaking down of barriers.\"",

      "\"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question,\" Trump said during his Dec. 22 speech to supporters at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest in Arizona. \"The United States has a big invested interest in the secure, efficient and reliable operation of the Panama Canal.\"",
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who was elected in May, called Trump's statements an affront to his country's sovereignty and said the fees for ships crossing the canal are set by experts who take into account operational costs, and supply and demand factors.",
      "\"The tariffs are not set on a whim,\" Mulino said.",
      "Cardin noted on \"This Week\" that the obligations of the U.S. and Panama were established by the Panama Canal and Neutrality Treaty of 1977 and ratified by Congress.",
      "\"I don't know what the president-elect is saying in regards to how sincere he is, but I can tell you, it does raise questions globally as to whether we're a reliable partner,\" Cardin said. \"And it really feeds into Russia and China appeal to other countries as to whether they need to make alliances with -- with Russia and China, whether America will be there for them globally.\"",
      "Pressed by Karl on other statements Trump has recently made, including buying Greenland from the Danish government and making Canada the 51st U.S. state -- even mocking Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \"Governor\" -- Cardin said such talk is not helpful.",
      "\"Globally, we saw the same type of statements made during his previous administration, when he threatened to pull out of NATO,\" Cardin said of Trump. \"These are treaty obligations which our allies rely upon, and it raises serious concerns about whether America will be there for them.\"",
      "Asked by Karl about Ukraine's future during a second Trump administration, Cardin said that while there continues to be bipartisan support in Congress, he described Trump's comments on Ukraine as \"very disturbing.\"",
      "Trump recently suggested that he may reverse President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory, calling the decision \"stupid.\"",
      "Cardin said Ukraine is the \"front line of defense for democracy.\"",
      "\"We know that Russia will not stop with Ukraine. We know many other countries feel at risk if Ukraine is not able to defend its sovereignty... I know some of the president-elect's comments are very disturbing. I've talked to the Ukrainians. I've talked to the Europeans several times, I think they question whether America's resolve will be there,\" he said. \"I can tell you we have bipartisan support in the United States Congress to stand with Ukraine because we recognize the importance to our national security.\"",

      "Key parliamentary elections are coming in the Western European country.",

      "Germany is to vote in an early election on Feb. 23 after Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s three-party governing coalition collapsed last month in a dispute over how to revitalize the country\u2019s stagnant economy.",
      "Musk's guest opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag \u2014a sister publication of POLITICO owned by the Axel Springer Group \u2014 published in German over the weekend, was the second time this month he supported the Alternative for Germany, or AfD.",
      "\u201cThe Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,\" Musk wrote in his translated commentary.",
      "He went on to say the far-right party \u201ccan lead the country into a future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity and technological innovation are not just wishes, but reality.\u201d",
      "The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country's condition.",
      "The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party.",
      "An ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, the technology billionaire challenged in his opinion piece the party's public image.",
      "\u201cThe portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party\u2019s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!\u201d",

    "summary": "Two weeks before the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments over TikTok's future, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to delay a Jan. 19 deadline.",
    "story": [
      "The high court is set to hear arguments Jan. 10.",
      "Two weeks before the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments over TikTok's future, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to delay a Jan. 19 deadline for the app to be sold to a new owner or face a ban in the U.S.",
      "An amicus brief filed by Trump's nominee to be solicitor general, John Sauer, is asking the court to grant a stay delaying the deadline so that the incoming president can work out a \"negotiated resolution\" that would save the app.",
      "The filing casts Trump as someone who \"alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government.\"",
      "Trump's brief says he \"opposes banning TikTok in the United States at this juncture,\" but does not express the view that the law requiring the sale violates the First Amendment, saying he takes no position on the merits of the case.",
      "Instead, the filing from Sauer asks the court to put the deadline on pause to allow Trump's incoming administration \"to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\"",
      "TikTok, which has over 170 million U.S. users, has sued over the law requiring it to be sold by its current Chinese-based owner ByteDance by Jan. 19 or be banned in the U.S.",
      "A federal appeals court earlier this month rejected the company's request for an emergency pause in the deadline.",
      "The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in the case on Jan. 10.",
      "President Joe Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which was part of a massive, $95 billion foreign aid package passed by Congress, on April 24.",
      "Biden and some congressional leaders argued that the ultimatum against TikTok was necessary because of security concerns about ByteDance and its connections to the Chinese government.",
      "Trump originally tried to ban TikTok in his first term, but has since reversed course, vowing during the 2024 presidential campaign to \"save\" the app.",
      "In Trump\u2019s amicus brief, Sauer raised the idea of social media censorship, invoking Brazil\u2019s recent month-long ban of social media platform X, the treatment of the Hunter Biden laptop story and government efforts to stamp out COVID-19 misinformation as incidents that should give the justices pause.",
      "\u201cThis Court should be deeply concerned about setting a precedent that could create a slippery slope toward global government censorship of social media speech,\u201d Sauer wrote in the filing. \u201cThe power of a Western government to ban an entire social-media platform with more than 100 million users, at the very least, should be considered and exercised with the most extreme care\u2014not reviewed on a \u2018highly expedited basis.\u2019\u201d",
      "While Sauer acknowledged that TikTok may pose national security risks while it remains under ByteDance\u2019s control, he also urges the justices to be skeptical of national security officials, whom, he said, \u201chave repeatedly procured social-media censorship of disfavored content and viewpoints through a combination of pressure, coercion, and deception.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a jarring parallel between the D.C. Circuit\u2019s near-plenary deference to national security officials calling for social-media censorship, and the recent, well-documented history of federal officials\u2019 extensive involvement in social-media censorship efforts directed at the speech of tens of millions Americans,\u201d Sauer wrote.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 10:11:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Carter reinvented the post-presidency, manifesting its possibilities and potential and providing a playbook, and a daunting standard, for activist former presidents.",
    "story": [
      "Along the way, Carter reinvented the post-presidency.",
      "What ended up as the most consequential post-presidency in U.S. history began just as inauspiciously.",
      "Jimmy Carter had lost his 1980 bid for reelection by ten percentage points, pulling just 41% of the popular vote versus 51% by his Republican challenger, Ronald Reagan. Shortly afterward, he discovered that the prosperous agricultural business he had built earlier in his career had been driven into the ground by a blind trust, leaving him millions in debt, adding to the $1.4 million of debt he had accrued as part of his failed reelection campaign, with no cash reserves to pay it off.",
      "Then there was the unresolved matter of the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which had crippled Carter's presidency, leading critics to charge him with being weak and ineffectual. When Reagan succeeded him as president on Jan. 20, 1981, Carter had been awake for over two full days as he oversaw the negotiation to release the 52 American hostages that had been detained by the Iranian government for 444 days. A last thumb in Carter's eye: They would be freed in the first minutes of Reagan's presidency.",
      "Upon relinquishing the White House, Carter returned briefly to his native Plains, Georgia, which at the time boasted a population of just 640 residents, where he was welcomed home in a driving rain by friends and neighbors with a covered-dish supper. The rain-soaked homecoming didn't last for long. Just hours afterward, Carter flew off to Wiesbaden, Germany, to greet the freed hostages, only to be met with anger by many of them who believed he had failed to ensure their liberation earlier.",
      "On Jan. 22, 1980, Carter returned to Plains, to the ranch-style home he and wife Rosalynn had built in 1961, but hadn't lived in for ten years. Exhausted and depleted, the now former president slept for 24 hours before awakening to what he described as \"an altogether unwanted life\" \u2013 and with no idea what he would do next.",
      "Twenty-one years later, Carter would be awakened by an early-morning phone call in that same home, in that same small town, with the news that he had won the Nobel Peace Prize for, as the Nobel committee wrote, \"his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\"",
      "Along the way, Carter reinvented the post-presidency, manifesting its possibilities and potential and providing a playbook, and a daunting standard, for activist former presidents. He showed how a president can leverage the stature of being a \"former\" to advance a philanthropic agenda, while enhancing his overall legacy and strengthening the American brand.",
      "The improbable journey from newly defeated one-term president to Nobel laureate reflected a pattern throughout Carter's fruitful life, one spent achieving outsize ambitions by defying long odds. Carter launched his career in politics in 1962 by challenging the political machine in Southwestern Georgia, successfully contesting a rigged election and winning a seat in the Georgia state legislature. While he lost a race for Georgia governor four years later, he came back to win the office in 1970, becoming one of a crop of new leaders to usher in a new, post-segregation South.",
      "After leaving the governor's mansion in 1975 due to a state law then prohibiting governors from serving consecutive terms, Carter set his sights on the distant presidency, a dark-horse former governor of a deep Southern state with little or no name recognition \u2013 so much so that even his home state\u2019s Atlanta Constitution newspaper ran a story headlined, \u201cJimmy Who Is Running for What?\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody thought I had a chance in God\u2019s world to be the nominee,\u201d Carter told me in 2013.",
      "His unlikely nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate and subsequent victory over incumbent President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election spoke to Carter's relentless drive and preternatural self-assuredness.",
      "Those same qualities would come to bear in his post-White House endeavors. Just a little more than a year out of office, as he considered his future, Carter had an epiphany: that he could create a nongovernmental, non-profit organization that could focus on intractable problems around the world which the international community and the United Nations were not addressing. The Carter Center, attached to his presidential library in Atlanta, did just that, becoming an outlet for the former president's activism and vision for a better world.",
      "Since its launch in 1982, the Carter Center, scrupulously overseen by Carter himself, has monitored over a hundred elections in 39 countries and has helped to peacefully resolve disputes throughout the world \u2013 including in Haiti, Sudan, and Bosnia \u2013 while working toward the eradication of Guinea worm disease and river blindness, insidious ailments that went largely unchecked among the world's poor and developing nations. Recognizing his skill in conflict resolution, President Bill Clinton tapped the ex-president in the 1990s to represent the U.S. in a negotiation to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and in staving off a U.S. military invasion of Haiti.",
      "As prodigious as they were, Carter's activities weren't limited to the Carter Center. Soon into his post-presidency, Carter took up a hammer for Habitat for Humanity, providing both labor and inspiration for the next four-and-a-half decades on work projects that bear his name. Somehow, he also found time to teach Sunday school nearly every week at Plains' Maranatha Baptist Church \u2013 and pose afterward for photographs with visitors to the congregation \u2013 as well as do woodwork, fly fish, paint, and become our most prolific presidential author.",
      "Carter sometimes bristled when he was called \"our best ex-president,\" a backhanded compliment that disregarded a presidential term that he saw as largely successful. \"I don't know of any decisions I made in the White House that were basically erroneous,\" he told me in 2005.",
      "But he didn't spend a great deal of time worrying about his place in the presidential pantheon. The things Jimmy Carter wanted to be remembered for went beyond any achievement he may have chalked up in the White House.",
      "In 2014, in an interview at the LBJ Library, I asked Carter how he wanted to be remembered.",
      "\"I think lot of people will say 'He only served one term and got defeated [for reelection],'\" he replied. \"I would like for people to remember that I kept the peace and that I promoted human rights \u2026That would be my preference.\"",
      "He will get his wish.",
      "Mark K. Updegrove is a presidential historian and ABC News political contributor. He is the president and CEO of the LBJ Foundation, and the author of \"Second Acts: Presidential Lives and Legacies After the White House.\"",

      "Jimmy Carter\u2019s funeral will feature an interstate choreography of grief, ceremony and logistics that is characteristic of state funerals",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Carter's memorial journey will end at his house in the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, where he grew up on a peanut farm. That is where his wife, Rosalynn, was laid to rest last year in a burial plot that they chose years ago.",
      "But before Carter reaches his humble final destination, there will be an interstate choreography of grief, ceremony and logistics that is characteristic of state funerals. Ever since the nation\u2019s founding, America has bid farewell to former presidents with an intricate series of events weaving together longstanding traditions and personal touches.",
      "Funerals often are planned by the presidents themselves, who usually have years after leaving the White House to ponder how they want to be memorialized.",
      "\u201cThey are very much involved in the planning process, and the decisions that they make tell us a lot about who they are, how they see the presidency, and how they want to be remembered by the American people,\u201d said Matthew Costello, senior historian for the White House Historical Association, who co-wrote a book called \u201cMourning the Presidents: Loss and Legacy in American Culture.\u201d",
      "Carter had more time to plan than most. He lived for 43 years after his presidency ended, the longest post-presidency in U.S. history, before dying Sunday at 100.",
      "Many details of his funeral remain under wraps, at the discretion of the family and military units that are responsible for carrying out the plans. Most presidents lie in state in the U.S. Capitol, and there is usually a service at Washington National Cathedral.",
      "President Joe Biden let slip last year that Carter had asked him to give a eulogy. (\u201cExcuse me, I shouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d Biden admitted.)",
      "Biden said Sunday his team is working with Carter's family and others \u201cto see to it that he is remembered appropriately, here in the United States and around the world.\u201d Carter\u2019s son Chip is his main point of contact, though Biden said he has spoken with all the Carter children.",
      "He described a process underway \u201cthat will take a little time\u201d but will result in a \u201cmajor service in Washington, D.C.\u201d for Carter, which Biden scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "Sometimes former presidents help with even the smallest details.",
      "Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, recalled meeting with George H.W. Bush shortly after the former president revised the seating chart for his funeral.",
      "\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Is that weird? You know, it\u2019s your own death,\u2019\u201d Engel recalled. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018You know, you do it every three months. You kind of get used to it.\u2019\u201d",
      "President Dwight Eisenhower, who commanded Allied troops during World War II before becoming a politician, wanted to be buried in an $80 government-issued casket. Apart from a glass seal that was added to the design, it was indistinguishable from the casket of any other solider.",
      "Details of the processions also can reflect aspects of a president\u2019s life. Ronald Reagan\u2019s casket was carried up the west steps of the U.S. Capitol, which face his home state of California. When Gerald Ford died, his casket was brought through the House side of the building, a nod to his years as a lawmaker.",
      "The job of carrying out presidential funerals falls to the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region, which includes 4,000 military and civilian personnel. The unit said in a statement that it \u201cis privileged to provide this support on behalf of the nation.\u201d",
      "Presidential funerals can leave lasting marks on the American consciousness. One of the most memorable descriptions of George Washington \u2014 \u201cfirst in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\u201d \u2014 came from a eulogy that was widely reprinted when the country\u2019s first leader died.",
      "After John F. Kennedy was assassinated, his son John Jr. was photographed saluting the casket. Kennedy's casket was transported down Pennsylvania Avenue on the same caisson that carried Abraham Lincoln after he was assassinated a century earlier, and a riderless horse was included in the procession.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s was the first presidential funeral to be widely televised.",
      "\u201cTechnology has made mourning in a way more accessible, more democratic. More people have the opportunity to take a moment and reflect upon what this person meant,\u201d Costello said. \u201cAnd I think it also opens the door to more people being involved in the grieving process.\u201d",
      "In many democratic countries, the head of state and the head of government are two different people. The United States combines both roles, ceremonial and chief executive, into the office of the presidency.",
      "\u201cSince we have no national figure other than the president, we\u2019ve essentially taken all the traditional weight and civic emotion that is put on to the death or the birth or a wedding for a sovereign or a king and placed it on the heads of the presidents,\u201d Engel said. \u201cAnd there aren\u2019t that many of them, to be honest. So whenever one of them passes, it\u2019s unusual and a big deal.\u201d",
      "He described funerals as a moment to remember \u201cthat we\u2019re all in this together\u201d and \u201cthis man was the president for all of us, whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat.\"",
      "However, in today\u2019s divided politics, state funerals can produce awkward, even tense, moments.",
      "During George H.W. Bush\u2019s funeral in 2018, the audience included President Donald Trump. He shook hands with former President Barack Obama, his predecessor, but did not interact with Hillary Clinton, who he defeated in the 2016 election, or her husband, former President Bill Clinton.",
      "\u201cThese funerals are always political,\u201d Engel said. \u201cWhatever happens in the Carter funeral is going to be political, frankly, whether people around the Carter family want it to be or not.\u201d",

      "Republicans will choose a new speaker when Congress returns in the New Year.",
      "Republican Rep. Mike Lawler argued Sunday that Rep. Mike Johnson should be reelected as speaker of the House despite Republican infighting on whether he should keep the position after how he handled a spending bill that prevented a government shutdown last week.",
      "\"Mike Johnson inherited a disaster when [former Rep.] Matt Gaetz and several of my colleagues teamed up with 208 Democrats to remove Kevin McCarthy, which will go down as the single stupidest thing I've ever seen in politics,\" the New York lawmaker told ABC's \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl.",
      "\"With that said, removing Mike Johnson would equally be as stupid. The fact is that these folks are playing with fire, and if they think they're somehow going to get a more conservative speaker, they're kidding themselves,\" he said, pointing out that Johnson was successful in keeping a Republican majority in the House.",
      "Republicans are expected to hold 219 seats when the new Congress convenes on Friday. Electing the speaker of the House will be the first order of business, and the House cannot move on to other business until that happens. If all Democrats are present and vote against Johnson, the Louisiana Republican can only afford to lose one Republican vote. One Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, has already said he will not support Johnson while other GOP hardliners have yet to commit to backing him.",
      "\"I'm not going to bend to their will,\" Lawler said of his hardline colleagues. \"So if they think somehow that they are going to end up in a stronger position by removing Mike Johnson, they're not.\"",
      "Republicans have also been feuding over H-1B work visas, which allow highly skilled foreign workers into the Unites States to fill specialty occupations.",
      "Trump\u2019s \"Department of Government Efficiency\" leaders, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, support increasing the amount of the visas awarded annually, arguing they will bring more talent into the country. But other Trump supporters say those job opportunities should be for Americans.",
      "In a post on X this week, Musk said \"OF COURSE my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans and we DO, as that is MUCH easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process. HOWEVER, there is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America.\"",
      "Ramaswamy criticized the American workforce, writing on X that \u201cAmerican culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long (at least since the 90s and likely longer). That doesn\u2019t start in college, it starts YOUNG.\u201d",
      "After Musk went after critics of his position in a series of X posts, writing at one point, \u201cI will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,\u201d former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called him a \u201ctoddler.\u201d",
      "Lawler voiced his support for the H-1B program, telling Karl that it is critical to the economy.",
      "\u201cAs President Trump said, it's a program he's used over the years for his businesses, and it's something that has obviously been beneficial to our economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States has been built on immigration and it is vital to the continued growth within our economy.\u201d",
      "Pressed by Karl about why some Trump supporters are strongly against the visas, Lawler expressed his desire for Americans to fill needed jobs, \u201cbut the fact is, India is producing a significant number more of engineers than we are. So it's both a function of fixing our education system and having a legal immigration system that works.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou cannot have no immigration at all. It will cripple the economy long-term,\u201d he said.",

      "LONDON -- Travelers flying to or from the U.K. faced further disruptions Saturday as thick fog and low visibility restricted air traffic on one of the year's busiest weekends.",
      "Gatwick Airport in London warned that some flights may be delayed throughout Saturday and apologized for the inconvenience. Flights were delayed by up to three hours late Friday because of poor weather conditions, and at least 40 flights from the airport, mostly short-haul to Europe, were delayed Saturday morning.",
      "Heathrow Airport, one of Europe's busiest, advised passengers to check with their airlines regarding potential delays. Disruptions were also reported at other U.K. airports including Stansted Airport in London and Manchester Airport.",
      "The U.K.'s weather forecasters, the Met Office, said thick fog patches could reduce visibility to just 100 meters (328 feet) in some areas across the country. It said travelers should allow \u201ca little bit longer\u201d for journeys and warned drivers to be extra careful.",
      "Kiera Quayle and her husband, who were visiting family for Christmas on the Isle of Man, were among many affected. Their return flight to London was delayed by hours and then canceled late Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and stressful but I overheard a few families who are now missing holidays and work who have it worse at this point,\" she said.",
      "Conditions are expected to improve Sunday, the Met Office said.",
      "The country's main air traffic control organization said the restrictions would remain in place in areas with low visibility.",
      "\u201cRestrictions of this sort are only ever applied to maintain safety,\" it said. \u201cOur teams are working closely with the airports and airlines to minimize disruption.\u201d",
      "The restrictions came at a busy time of year when many people travel following the Christmas holiday and ahead of the New Year."

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 08:18:21 -0500",

    "story": [
      "In a deeply partisan Congress, one group of lawmakers with a shared background is working in a bipartisan way to try to pass important legislation",
      "WASHINGTON -- The players in this year's Army-Navy football game kept up a long tradition, with each side honoring the other\u2019s school song when the contest ended. It was an acknowledgment that the future could bring moments when the opponents that day are teammates on deadlier fields.",
      "That ethos also guides a group in the U.S. House that calls itself the For Country Caucus. Its members are veterans with wide military experience who have banded together across party and ideological lines. At a time when bipartisan working relationships in Congress seem rare, with little hope for change in the coming session, the caucus shows there are still spaces where people with different views come together.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to lead by example, both within Congress to show our colleagues that this is possible, but also to America more broadly,\u201d said Colorado Democrat Jason Crow, who is one of the outgoing co-chairs of the caucus.",
      "\u201cPeople only get deluged with the crazy aspects of Congress and the things that don\u2019t work and the people yelling and screaming,\" Crow said. \"We just don\u2019t get as much attention when we\u2019re actually working together.\u201d",
      "The caucus began in 2019 to bridge the divides that plague Washington and slow its effectiveness, said Steve Womack, a Republican member of the caucus from Arkansas and a retired colonel in the Army National Guard.",
      "Bringing together people who see themselves as sharing a commitment to putting country and mission first seemed like a starting point \u201cto maybe advance some agendas that would be good for the country,'' Womack said. Deadlines, comfort with high-pressure situations and a focus on common goals create \u201ca kind of warrior ethos,\u201d he said.",
      "Since then, the group has been integral in getting more than 100 bills passed into law. The legislation includes such areas as national security, strengthening the military, veterans' issues, national service and supporting military families, especially those that have lost loved ones.",
      "The caucus was instrumental in getting an increase \u2014 the first in two decades \u2014 in payments designed to help military families bear the added financial costs of deployments. The caucus also pushed a provision to allow federal agencies to appoint military spouses to remote work positions, an action that could allow them to keep their jobs despite multiple moves.",
      "Other legislation signed recently included an act to help continue efforts to evacuate Afghans who served alongside U.S. military members, diplomats and aid workers in Afghanistan.",
      "One of the group's first successes was the effort to establish the Global War on Terrorism Memorial on the National Mall. Its design is underway.",
      "\u201cWe are a small but mighty caucus that punches way above its weight,\u201d Crow said.",
      "Members of it sit on a number of committees together and meet regularly, including breakfast briefings twice a month. Recently, those briefings have included the heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Space Force, as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "Other guests have spoken about national service, such as the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and Voices for National Service.",
      "\u201cWe believe really strongly that one of the ways to bring Americans together is to get Americans to work together again,\u201d Crow said.",
      "That doesn't have to be in the military, he said. People also can find common ground by serving their communities.",
      "Their staff members also meet, and the representatives have some functions off Capitol Hill, including washing the black granite walls at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.",
      "Two members of the outgoing group are retiring, while the 28 others were reelected. The caucus expects to pick up at least five new members in the next Congress, meaning nearly 8% of the House will be part of the caucus.",
      "Crow, a former Army Ranger who served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his co-chair, Texas Republican Tony Gonzales, a retired Navy chief petty officer, will hand over the leadership to Texas Republican Jake Ellzey, a former F/A-18 pilot, and Air Force Academy alumnus Don Davis, a North Carolina Democrat.",
      "Edward Crawford, a co-founder of War Veterans Fund, which recruits Republican war veterans to run for Congress, has had several candidates join the caucus after winning their races.",
      "\u201cIn a polarized world and a very polarized country, we veterans have to work with everybody,\" he said. \"You go into combat, Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re getting shot at. You\u2019re working together. You\u2019re covering each other. Democrat or Republican, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "A Navy veteran himself, Crawford said that while his organization centers on Republican prospects, he refers Democrats to his counterpart at a group called With Honor Action, because that nonpartisan organization promotes veterans from both parties for elective office.",
      "\u201cWe want them to be successful, too,\" he said. \u201cWe want both sides of the aisle to get more veterans.\u201d",
      "Several of the members already had direct military connections.",
      "Reps. Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat, and John James, a Republican from Michigan, were West Point classmates who at one time lived on the same hall. Ryan is the first West Point graduate to represent the district where the academy is located.",
      "Ellzey flew in a squadron that provided air support in Afghanistan for Mike Waltz, a Florida Republican and caucus member, during one of Waltz's military deployments. A former Green Beret, Waltz has been tapped to become President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser.",
      "Crow and Womack, who were interviewed together, said they have been monitoring the debate over Pete Hegseth, Trump's nominee to lead the Defense Department, as well as issues related to the nomination such as veterans' benefits and women in combat.",
      "Womack said the nomination is the Senate's responsibility, but if issues that are counter to the ideals of the caucus are floated, \u201cthe whole For Country Caucus will be ready to spring into action. I think to the person, we all kind of know where each other is on those kinds of subjects.\"",
      "But, he added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit premature right now to get too caught up in the conjecture of what may or may not happen in the new Congress.\u201d",
      "Crow said questions about women in combat are non-issues.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to take a position because it\u2019s just the fact that women serve in combat,\" he said. \"There are people in the caucus that have had that experience. So for us, this is not even a question.\u201d",
      "He said the caucus was made up of men and women of different backgrounds, nationalities, races and political positions. The outgoing co-vice chairs are New Jersey Democrat Mike Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, an Iowa Republican and Army and Army Reserves veteran whose career includes stints as a nurse and physician.",
      "Pushing specific ideologies is not part of its purpose, Crow said. Finding common ground, even in disagreements, is.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to take an all-or-nothing mentality because we know that when people take an all-or-nothing mentality, Americans end up with nothing,\u201d he said. \"That\u2019s just not acceptable to us.\u201d"

      "Value was in vogue in 2024.",
      "Shoppers and restaurant patrons in the U.S. were choosy about where and how to spend their money as they wrestled with high housing and food prices.",
      "Well-heeled customers traded down to Walmart and Aldi. Diners opted for fast food or home cooking instead of sit-down restaurants. Department stores struggled as buyers shopped online or at cheaper chains like H&M.",
      "Residents also moved away from buying furniture or investing in expensive renovations, opting to refresh their homes with inexpensive items like frames and candles.",
      "Those shifts changed the buying and eating landscape in 2024. As of Dec. 20, Coresight Research tracked 48 retail bankruptcies in the U.S., compared with 25 during the same period a year ago. And at least 22 restaurant chains filed for bankruptcy this year, the highest number since 2020, according to BankruptcyData, a company that tracks filings.",
      "Here are some of the trends \u2013 and dead ends \u2013 that The Associated Press tracked in 2024:",
      "WALMART",
      "The nation\u2019s largest retailer typically shines during tough times as shoppers turn to the discounter for groceries, which account for 60% of Walmart's total business. And just like during the 2008 Great Recession, Walmart saw households with incomes of $100,000 or above making up more of its clientele. But this time around, company executives think they can keep those customers because they\u2019ve expanded online services and added more stylish clothes and mannequins.",
      "AMAZON",
      "Online juggernaut Amazon leaned into its reputation as a destination for deals to appeal to bargain-hungry buyers. In November it launched Amazon Haul, a new low-cost storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced under $20. And the company said its Prime Day event in July resulted in record sales. But Amazon could face headwinds in the coming year with threatened tariffs on products from China and labor unrest in the U.S.",
      "FAST CASUAL CHAINS",
      "It was a good year for restaurant chains like Shake Shack that are a step up from fast food but still offer good value. Cava, which specializes in fresh Mediterranean food, said its revenue surged more than 33% in the first nine months of this year as it rapidly built new restaurants. Chipotle got some heat from value-conscious diners about smaller portions, but drew customers back after retraining workers to ensure \u201cconsistent and generous\u201d portions.",
      "JEANS SELLERS",
      "The wide-leg jeans silhouette \u2013 the \u201cit\u201d style that rapidly replaced boot-cut and skinny jeans \u2013 drove sales across many different retailers this year. Macy\u2019s, Abercrombie & Fitch, Levi Strauss, Gap and Stitch Fix were among those citing the trend as a big sales booster in recent months. Value-conscious buyers could snap them up at Walmart for $29. At the high end, Gucci had wide-leg versions for $1,200.",
      "MCDONALD\u2019S",
      "The year didn\u2019t begin well for McDonald\u2019s. The company\u2019s sales slumped as inflation-weary customers chose to eat at home instead of grabbing fast food. But a $5 meal deal introduced in June helped draw lower-income customers back into stores. McDonald\u2019s extended the deal through the end of this year and said more value is coming in 2025. The fast food giant is working to get customers back after a fall E. coli outbreak linked to raw onions in Quarter Pounder hamburgers sickened at least 104 people in 14 states.",
      "TARGET",
      "Target\u2019s cheap chic fashions and home decor have long been a big attraction, but the chain faced challenges in 2024. Unlike Walmart, Target is more reliant on discretionary items like clothing because less than a quarter of its sales come from food and beverages. It has always battled a perception of being more expensive, and analysts say its merchandise has lately been in disarray. Still, Target drew crowds on Black Friday with exclusive Taylor Swift products.",
      "STARBUCKS",
      "Starbucks had a tough year. Orders are getting increasingly complex, with thousands of ways to customize drinks. That\u2019s leading to long lines and incorrect pickup times on the mobile app. New offerings like olive oil-infused coffee didn\u2019t attract customers, who also grew tired of Starbucks\u2019 high prices. Starbucks hired a new CEO, Brian Niccol, in the fall to help turn things around. But labor strife, which led to strikes in December, could continue to hurt the company in 2025.",
      "LEGACY RESTAURANTS",
      "Several decades-old chains threw in the towel in 2024, succumbing to rising competition, changing dining patterns and big portfolios of outdated restaurants. Red Lobster, TGI Fridays and Buca di Beppo all filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and shuttered dozens of locations. A leaner Red Lobster later exited bankruptcy under new ownership, but it remains to be seen whether older chains can turn around years of declining sales.",
      "BIG TICKET ITEMS",
      "At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. consumers took advantage of low interest rates and stimulus benefits to remodel their homes and make other big purchases. But last year, they pulled back. That\u2019s been a challenge for retailers like Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, which noted lower sales of appliances, home theaters and gaming equipment. Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s also reported lower sales of big-ticket items, particularly discretionary kitchen and bathroom remodeling projects.",
      "DEPARTMENT STORES",
      "Department stores, particularly those catering to middle income shoppers, have struggled to hold onto customers as many turn to online shopping or to fast-fashion retailers. Among the worst performers: Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl\u2019s, which reported its 11th consecutive quarter of sales declines this year. Outgoing CEO Tom Kingsbury recently owned up to merchandising mistakes, including scaling back fine jewelry, popular store label brands and petite sizes. Customers will see those categories return in the coming year.",
      "Macy\u2019s said it would close 150 namesake stores over three years and open 15 higher-end Bloomingdale\u2019s. Upscale Nordstrom, on the other hand, had a better than expected fiscal year due largely to soaring sales at its off-price Nordstrom Rack stores."

      "The 39th and longest-lived U.S. president, James Earl Carter Jr., died Sunday at the age of 100",
      "PLAINS, Ga. -- Newly married and sworn as a Naval officer, Jimmy Carter left his tiny hometown in 1946 hoping to climb the ranks and see the world.",
      "Less than a decade later, the death of his father and namesake, a merchant farmer and local politician who went by \u201cMr. Earl,\u201d prompted the submariner and his wife, Rosalynn, to return to the rural life of Plains, Georgia, they thought they\u2019d escaped.",
      "The lieutenant never would be an admiral. Instead, he became commander in chief. Years after his presidency ended in humbling defeat, he would add a Nobel Peace Prize, awarded not for his White House accomplishments but \u201cfor his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\u201d",
      "The life of James Earl Carter Jr., the 39th and longest-lived U.S. president, ended Sunday at the age of 100 where it began: Plains, the town of 600 that fueled his political rise, welcomed him after his fall and sustained him during 40 years of service that redefined what it means to be a former president.",
      "With the stubborn confidence of an engineer and an optimism rooted in his Baptist faith, Carter described his motivations in politics and beyond in the same way: an almost missionary zeal to solve problems and improve lives.",
      "Carter was raised amid racism, abject poverty and hard rural living \u2014 realities that shaped both his deliberate politics and emphasis on human rights.",
      "\u201cHe always felt a responsibility to help people,\u201d said Jill Stuckey, a longtime friend of Carter's in Plains. \u201cAnd when he couldn\u2019t make change wherever he was, he decided he had to go higher.\u201d",
      "Carter's path, a mix of happenstance and calculation, pitted moral imperatives against political pragmatism; and it defied typical labels of American politics, especially caricatures of one-term presidents as failures.",
      "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t judge presidents by how popular they are in their day. That's a very narrow way of assessing them,\" Carter biographer Jonathan Alter told the Associated Press. \u201cWe should judge them by how they changed the country and the world for the better. On that score, Jimmy Carter is not in the first rank of American presidents, but he stands up quite well.\u201d",
      "Later in life, Carter conceded that many Americans, even those too young to remember his tenure, judged him ineffective for failing to contain inflation or interest rates, end the energy crisis or quickly bring home American hostages in Iran. He gained admirers instead for his work at The Carter Center \u2014 advocating globally for public health, human rights and democracy since 1982 \u2014 and the decades he and Rosalynn wore hardhats and swung hammers with Habitat for Humanity.",
      "Yet the common view that he was better after the Oval Office than in it annoyed Carter, and his allies relished him living long enough to see historians reassess his presidency.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t quite fit in today\u2019s terms\u201d of a left-right, red-blue scoreboard, said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who visited the former president multiple times during his own White House bid.",
      "At various points in his political career, Carter labeled himself \u201cprogressive\u201d or \u201cconservative\u201d \u2014 sometimes both at once. His most ambitious health care bill failed \u2014 perhaps one of his biggest legislative disappointments \u2014 because it didn\u2019t go far enough to suit liberals. Republicans, especially after his 1980 defeat, cast him as a left-wing cartoon.",
      "It would be easiest to classify Carter as a centrist, Buttigieg said, \u201cbut there\u2019s also something radical about the depth of his commitment to looking after those who are left out of society and out of the economy.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Carter\u2019s legacy is stitched with complexities, contradictions and evolutions \u2014 personal and political.",
      "The self-styled peacemaker was a war-trained Naval Academy graduate who promised Democratic challenger Ted Kennedy that he\u2019d \u201ckick his ass.\u201d But he campaigned with a call to treat everyone with \u201crespect and compassion and with love.\u201d",
      "Carter vowed to restore America\u2019s virtue after the shame of Vietnam and Watergate, and his technocratic, good-government approach didn't suit Republicans who tagged government itself as the problem. It also sometimes put Carter at odds with fellow Democrats.",
      "The result still was a notable legislative record, with wins on the environment, education, and mental health care. He dramatically expanded federally protected lands, began deregulating air travel, railroads and trucking, and he put human rights at the center of U.S. foreign policy. As a fiscal hawk, Carter added a relative pittance to the national debt, unlike successors from both parties.",
      "Carter nonetheless struggled to make his achievements resonate with the electorate he charmed in 1976. Quoting Bob Dylan and grinning enthusiastically, he had promised voters he would \u201cnever tell a lie.\u201d Once in Washington, though, he led like a joyless engineer, insisting his ideas would become reality and he'd be rewarded politically if only he could convince enough people with facts and logic.",
      "This served him well at Camp David, where he brokered peace between Israel\u2019s Menachem Begin and Epypt\u2019s Anwar Sadat, an experience that later sparked the idea of The Carter Center in Atlanta. Carter's tenacity helped the center grow to a global force that monitored elections across five continents, enabled his freelance diplomacy and sent public health experts across the developing world. The center\u2019s wins were personal for Carter, who hoped to outlive the last Guinea worm parasite, and nearly did.",
      "As president, though, the approach fell short when he urged consumers beleaguered by energy costs to turn down their thermostats. Or when he tried to be the nation\u2019s cheerleader, beseeching Americans to overcome a collective \u201ccrisis of confidence.\u201d",
      "Republican Ronald Reagan exploited Carter's lecturing tone with a belittling quip in their lone 1980 debate. \u201cThere you go again,\u201d the former Hollywood actor said in response to a wonky answer from the sitting president. \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d outpaced Carter in all but six states.",
      "Carter later suggested he \u201ctried to do too much, too soon\u201d and mused that he was incompatible with Washington culture: media figures, lobbyists and Georgetown social elites who looked down on the Georgians and their inner circle as \u201ccountry come to town.\u201d",
      "Carter carefully navigated divides on race and class on his way to the Oval Office.",
      "Born Oct. 1, 1924, Carter was raised in the mostly Black community of Archery, just outside Plains, by a progressive mother and white supremacist father. Their home had no running water or electricity but the future president still grew up with the relative advantages of a locally prominent, land-owning family in a system of Jim Crow segregation.",
      "He wrote of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s towering presence and his family\u2019s Democratic Party roots, but his father soured on FDR, and Jimmy Carter never campaigned or governed as a New Deal liberal. He offered himself as a small-town peanut farmer with an understated style, carrying his own luggage, bunking with supporters during his first presidential campaign and always using his nickname.",
      "And he began his political career in a whites-only Democratic Party.",
      "As private citizens, he and Rosalynn supported integration as early as the 1950s and believed it inevitable. Carter refused to join the White Citizens Council in Plains and spoke out in his Baptist church against denying Black people access to worship services.",
      "\u201cThis is not my house; this is not your house,\u201d he said in a churchwide meeting, reminding fellow parishioners their sanctuary belonged to God.",
      "Yet as the appointed chairman of Sumter County schools he never pushed to desegregate, thinking it impractical after the Supreme Court\u2019s 1954 Brown v. Board decision. And while presidential candidate Carter would hail the 1965 Voting Rights Act, signed by fellow Democrat Lyndon Johnson when Carter was a state senator, there is no record of Carter publicly supporting it at the time.",
      "Carter overcame a ballot-stuffing opponent to win his legislative seat, then lost the 1966 governor's race to an arch-segregationist. He won four years later by avoiding explicit mentions of race and campaigning to the right of his rival, who he mocked as \u201cCufflinks Carl\u201d \u2014 the insult of an ascendant politician who never saw himself as part the establishment.",
      "Carter\u2019s rural and small-town coalition in 1970 would match any victorious Republican electoral map in 2024. Once elected, though, Carter shocked his white conservative supporters \u2014 and landed on the cover of Time magazine \u2014 by declaring that \u201cthe time for racial discrimination is over.\u201d",
      "Before making the jump to Washington, Carter befriended the family of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., whom he\u2019d never sought out as he eyed the governor\u2019s office. Carter lamented his foot-dragging on school integration as a \u201cmistake.\u201d But he also met, conspicuously, with Alabama's segregationist Gov. George Wallace to accept his primary rival's endorsement ahead of the 1976 Democratic convention.",
      "\u201cHe very shrewdly took advantage of his own Southerness,\u201d said Amber Roessner, a University of Tennessee professor and expert on Carter\u2019s campaigns.",
      "A coalition of Black voters and white moderate Democrats ultimately made Carter the last Democratic presidential nominee to sweep the Deep South. Then, just as he did in Georgia, he used his power in office to appoint more non-whites than all his predecessors had, combined.",
      "He once acknowledged \u201cthe secret shame\u201d of white Americans who didn\u2019t fight segregation. But he also told Alter that doing more would have sacrificed his political viability \u2013 and thus everything he accomplished in office and after.",
      "King's daughter, Bernice King, described Carter as wisely \u201cstrategic\u201d in winning higher offices to enact change. \u201cHe was a leader of conscience,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "Rosalynn Carter, who died on Nov. 19 at the age of 96, was identified by both husband and wife as the \u201cmore political\u201d of the pair; she sat in on Cabinet meetings and urged him to postpone certain priorities, like pressing the Senate to relinquish control of the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cLet that go until the second term,\u201d she would sometimes say.",
      "The president, recalled her former aide Kathy Cade, retorted that he was \u201cgoing to do what\u2019s right\u201d even if \u201cit might cut short the time I have.\u201d",
      "Rosalynn held firm, Cade said: \u201cShe\u2019d remind him you have to win to govern.\u201d",
      "Carter also was the first president to appoint multiple women as Cabinet officers. Yet by his own telling, his career sprouted from chauvinism in the Carters' early marriage: He did not consult Rosalynn when deciding to move back to Plains in 1953 or before launching his state Senate bid a decade later.",
      "Many years later, he called it \u201cinconceivable\u201d that he didn\u2019t confer with the woman he described as his \u201cfull partner,\u201d at home, in government and at The Carter Center.",
      "\u201cWe developed a partnership when we were working in the farm supply business, and it continued when Jimmy got involved in politics,\u201d Rosalynn Carter told AP in 2021.",
      "So deep was their trust that when Carter remained tethered to the White House in 1980 as 52 Americans were held hostage in Tehran, it was Rosalynn who campaigned on her husband\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cI just loved it,\u201d she said, despite the bitterness of defeat.",
      "Fair or not, the label of a disastrous presidency had leading Democrats keep their distance, at least publicly, for many years, but Carter managed to remain relevant, writing books and weighing in on societal challenges.",
      "He lamented widening wealth gaps and the influence of money in politics. He voted for democratic socialist Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in 2016, and later declared that America had devolved from fully functioning democracy to \u201coligarchy.\u201d",
      "Yet looking ahead to 2020, with Sanders running again, Carter warned Democrats not to \u201cmove to a very liberal program,\u201d lest they help re-elect President Donald Trump. Carter scolded the Republican for his serial lies and threats to democracy, and chided the U.S. establishment for misunderstanding Trump\u2019s populist appeal.",
      "He delighted in yearly convocations with Emory University freshmen, often asking them to guess how much he\u2019d raised in his two general election campaigns. \u201cZero,\u201d he\u2019d gesture with a smile, explaining the public financing system candidates now avoid so they can raise billions. Carter still remained quite practical in partnering with wealthy corporations and foundations to advance Carter Center programs.",
      "Carter recognized that economic woes and the Iran crisis doomed his presidency, but offered no apologies for appointing Paul Volcker as the Federal Reserve chairman whose interest rate hikes would not curb inflation until Reagan's presidency. He was proud of getting all the hostages home without starting a shooting war, even though Tehran would not free them until Reagan's Inauguration Day.",
      "\u201cCarter didn\u2019t look at it\u201d as a failure, Alter emphasized. \u201cHe said, \u2018They came home safely.\u2019 And that\u2019s what he wanted.\u201d",
      "Well into their 90s, the Carters greeted visitors at Plains\u2019 Maranatha Baptist Church, where he taught Sunday School and where he will have his last funeral before being buried on family property alongside Rosalynn. Carter, who made the congregation\u2019s collection plates in his woodworking shop, still garnered headlines there, calling for women\u2019s rights within religious institutions, many of which, he said, \u201csubjugate\u201d women in church and society.",
      "Carter was not one to dwell on regrets. \u201cI am at peace with the accomplishments, regret the unrealized goals and utilize my former political position to enhance everything we do,\u201d he wrote around his 90th birthday.",
      "The politician who had supposedly hated Washington politics also enjoyed hosting Democratic presidential contenders as public pilgrimages to Plains became advantageous again. Carter sat with Buttigieg for the final time March 1, 2020, hours before the Indiana mayor ended his campaign and endorsed eventual winner Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cHe asked me how I thought the campaign was going,\u201d Buttigieg said, recalling that Carter flashed his signature grin and nodded along as the young candidate, born a year after Carter left office, \u201cput the best face\u201d on the walloping he endured the day before in South Carolina.",
      "Never breaking his smile, the 95-year-old host fired back, \u201cI think you ought to drop out.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo matter of fact,\u201d Buttigieg said with a laugh. \u201cIt was somehow encouraging.\u201d",
      "Carter had lived enough, won plenty and lost enough to take the long view.",
      "\u201cHe talked a lot about coming from nowhere,\u201d Buttigieg said, not just to attain the presidency but to leverage \u201call of the instruments you have in life\u201d and \u201cmake the world more peaceful.\u201d",
      "In his farewell address as president, Carter said as much to the country that had embraced and rejected him.",
      "\u201cThe struggle for human rights overrides all differences of color, nation or language,\u201d he declared. \u201cThose who hunger for freedom, who thirst for human dignity and who suffer for the sake of justice \u2014 they are the patriots of this cause.\u201d",
      "Carter pledged to remain engaged with and for them as he returned \u201chome to the South where I was born and raised,\u201d home to Plains, where that young lieutenant had indeed become \u201ca fellow citizen of the world.\u201d",
      "\u2014-",

      "Top ranked chess player Magnus Carlsen is headed back to the World Blitz Championship on Monday",
      "NEW YORK -- Top-ranked chess player Magnus Carlsen is headed back to the World Blitz Championship on Monday after its governing body agreed to loosen a dress code that got him fined and denied a late-round game in another tournament for refusing to change out of jeans.",
      "Lamenting the contretemps, International Chess Federation President Arkady Dvorkovich said in a statement Sunday that he'd let World Blitz Championship tournament officials consider allowing \u201cappropriate jeans\u201d with a jacket, and other \u201celegant minor deviations\u201d from the dress code.",
      "He said Carlsen's stand \u2014 which culminated in his quitting the tournament Friday \u2014 highlighted a need for more discussion \u201cto ensure that our rules and their application reflect the evolving nature of chess as a global and accessible sport.\u201d",
      "Carlsen, meanwhile, said in a video posted Sunday on social media that he would play \u2014 and wear jeans \u2014 in the World Blitz Championship when it begins Monday.",
      "\u201cI think the situation was badly mishandled on their side,\u201d the 34-year-old Norwegian grandmaster said. But he added that he loves playing blitz \u2014 a fast-paced form of chess \u2014 and wanted fans to be able to watch, and that he was encouraged by his discussions with the federation after Friday's showdown.",
      "\u201cI think we sort of all want the same thing,\u201d he suggested in the video on his Take Take Take chess app\u2019s YouTube channel. \u201cWe want the players to be comfortable, sure, but also relatively presentable.\u201d",
      "The events began when Carlsen wore jeans and a sportcoat Friday to the Rapid World Championship, which is separate from but held in conjunction with the blitz event. The chess federation said Friday that longstanding rules prohibit jeans at those tournaments, and players are lodged nearby to make sartorial switch-ups easy if needed.",
      "An official fined Carlsen $200 and asked him to change pants, but he refused and wasn't paired for a ninth-round game, the federation said at the time. The organization noted that another grandmaster, Ian Nepomniachtchi, was fined earlier in the day for wearing sports shoes, changed and continued to play.",
      "Carlsen has said that he offered to wear something else the next day, but officials were unyielding. He said \u201cit became a bit of a matter of principle,\u201d so he quit the rapid and blitz championships.",
      "In the video posted Sunday, he questioned whether he had indeed broken a rule and said changing clothes would have needlessly interrupted his concentration between games. He called the punishment \u201cunbelievably harsh.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, I could have changed. Obviously, I didn\u2019t want to,\u201d he said, and \u201cI stand by that.\u201d"

      "Numbers from the past few years show a maximum of 65 outbreaks reported during that first week of December.",

      "Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States, responsible for 58% of such infections acquired in the country each year, according to the CDC.",
      "Norovirus infections are caused by a group of viruses that spread easily, with as few as 10 viral particles having the ability to make someone sick, health experts say.",

      "People of all ages can get infected and fall sick from norovirus. Young children, older people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea the top concern.",
      "There is no medication to treat norovirus. Rehydration is recommended by drinking water and other liquids, with the exception of coffee, tea and alcohol.",
      "Anyone suffering from dehydration should seek medical help. Symptoms of dehydration include a decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat, and feeling dizzy when standing. Dehydrated children may be unusually sleepy or fussy and cry with few or no tears.",
      "Rigorous and frequent handwashing is the best defense against norovirus during the peak winter season, scrubbing the hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds before meals.",
      "Scrubbing surfaces with household disinfectants can also help."

Mitchell and the conspiring officer both admitted to investigators that they planned to physically punish the inmate as disciplinary action, authorities said.",
      "Mitchell's sentencing hearing is scheduled for late March, where he faces up to 10 years in prison."

    "story": [
      "Women may be at risk of missing out on opportunities at work as they are less likely to go into the office than men, the boss of the world's biggest building society has said.",
      "Speaking to BBC R4's Today programme, Nationwide chief executive Debbie Crosbie said it was important for career growth to have a \"physical presence\" in the workplace.",
      "Ms Crosbie brought an end to the organisation's \"work anywhere\" policy for its 13,000 non-branch staff last December, asking most full-time workers to come in twice a week instead.",
      "She suggested that while flexible working can be useful for those with caring responsibilities, it is important for workers to see leaders in action.",
      "Nationwide rebrands and commits to the high street",
      "Anger as Nationwide orders workers back to office",
      "Under its previous chief executive, Joe Garner, Nationwide had championed 100% remote working, citing research findings which suggested a \"work from anywhere\" policy had big benefits.",
      "Some staff moved away from their bases, others had childcare built around their new arrangements.",
      "However, Ms Crosbie said she believes in a more collaborative approach.",
      "After an agreement with the union, a hybrid policy was introduced, with most full-time workers asked to come into the office at least one or two days a week.",
      "The reversal was met with criticism from staff members who had made big changes during the course of the pandemic.",
      "But one year on, Ms Crosbie told the BBC that she has observed a noticeable difference in office attendance.",
      "\"We find, certainly at Nationwide... that men are more likely to come into the office than women\".",
      "She added that observing and interacting with leaders is crucial for growth, noting the impact of having a female chief executive act as her mentor early in her career.",
      "\"Being seen and then seeing other leaders is a really important part of development,\" Ms Crosbie explained.",
      "\"I benefited enormously from watching some really excellent leaders and how they navigated challenging problems.\"",
      "She also stressed the need for businesses to support female leaders and families with flexible childcare options.",
      "She acknowledged the challenges faced by senior executives in managing long hours and childcare responsibilities, emphasising the role firms can play.",
      "Previous research carried out by academics at Durham University and the University of Sheffield suggests that women are more likely to experience blurred boundaries between work and family life.",
      "It found that women working remotely were more likely to value being present for their families, while men were less inclined to interrupt their work schedules to address family needs.",
      "Its researchers suggested, however, that remote work can help employees with a better work-family balance if they are well supported.",
      "\"Businesses do have a role to play in that,\" Ms Crosbie said on Tuesday.",
      "\"We just need to be careful that we don't inadvertently prevent women from taking some of the opportunities by not being in the office when they feel it's beneficial both to their skills and to contribute to the business.\""

      "A fund created by the US government to help compensate victims of the late fraudster Bernard Madoff has begun making its final round of payments, according to a statement by the Department of Justice (DoJ).",
      "The payouts being made by the Madoff Victim Fund (MVF) are worth $131.4m (\u00a3104.6m) and will bring the total amount it has returned to 40,930 claimants to $4.3bn.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:05:18 GMT",
    "summary": "A row has erupted over a long-standing US visa programme, We looked into the figures behind the scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Some immigration hardliners say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:04:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Hurricane Beryl lashed the island in July, devastating much of its fishing fleet.",
    "story": [
      "There are few clearer signs of the destructive power that Hurricane Beryl unleashed on Barbados in July than the scene at the temporary boatyard in the capital, Bridgetown.",
      "Scores of mangled and cracked vessels sit on stacks, gaping holes in their hulls, their rudders snapped off and cabin windows broken.",
      "Yet these were the lucky ones.",
      "At least they can be repaired and put back out to sea. Many others sank, taking entire family incomes with them.",
      "When Beryl lashed Barbados, the island's fishing fleet was devastated in a matter of hours. About 75% of the active fleet was damaged, with 88 boats totally destroyed.",
      "Charles Carter, who owns a blue-and-black fishing vessel called Joyce, was among those affected.",
      "\"It's been real bad, I can tell you. I had to change both sides of the hull, up to the waterline,\" he says, pointing at the now pristine boat in front of us.",
      "It has taken months of restoration and thousands of dollars to get it back to this point, during which time Charles has barely been able to fish.",
      "\"That's my living, my livelihood, fishing is all I do,\" he says.",
      "\"The fishing industry is mash up,\" echoes his friend, Captain Euride. \"We're just trying to get back the pieces.\"",
      "Now, six months after the storm, there are signs of calmer waters. On a warm Saturday, several repaired vessels were put back into the ocean with the help of a crane, a trailer and some government support.",
      "Seeing Joyce back on the water is a welcome sight for all fishermen in Barbados.",
      "But Barbadians are acutely aware that climate change means more active and powerful Atlantic hurricane seasons - and it may be just another year or two before the fishing industry is struck again. Beryl, for example, was the earliest-forming Category 5 storm on record.",
      "Few understand the extent of the problem better than the island's Chief Fisheries Officer, Dr Shelly Ann Cox.",
      "\"Our captains have been reporting that sea conditions have changed,\" she explains. \"Higher swells, sea surface temperatures are much warmer and they're having difficulty getting flying fish now at the beginning of our pelagic season.\"",
      "The flying fish is a national symbol in Barbados and a key part of the island's cuisine. But climate change has been harming the stocks for years.",
      "At the Oistins Fish Market in Bridgetown, flying fish are still available, along with marlin, mahi-mahi and tuna, though only a handful of stalls are open.",
      "At one of them, Cornelius Carrington, from the Freedom Fish House. fillets a kingfish with the speed and dexterity of a man who has spent many years with a fish knife in his hands.",
      "\"Beryl was like a surprise attack, like an ambush,\" says Cornelius, in a deep baritone voice, over the market's chatter, reggae and thwack of cleavers on chopping boards.",
      "Cornelius lost one of his two boats in Hurricane Beryl. \"It's the first time a hurricane has come from the south like that, normally storms hit us from the north,\" he said.",
      "Although his second boat allowed him to stay afloat financially, Cornelius thinks the hand of climate change is increasingly present in the fishermen's fate.",
      "\"Right now, everything has changed. The tides are changing, the weather is changing, the temperature of the sea, the whole pattern has changed.\"",
      "The effects are also being felt in the tourism industry, he says, with hotels and restaurants struggling to find enough fish to meet demand each month.",
      "For Dr Shelly Ann Cox, public education is key and, she says, the message is getting through.",
      "\"Perhaps because we are an island and we're so connected to the water, people in Barbados can speak well on the impact on climate change and what that means for our country,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if you speak to children as well, they're very knowledgeable about the topic.\"",
      "To see for myself, I visited a secondary school \u2013 Harrison College \u2013 as a member of a local NGO, the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network (CYEN), talked to members of the school's Environmental Club about climate change.",
      "The CYEN representative, Sheldon Marshall, is an energy expert who quizzed the pupils about greenhouse gases and the steps they could take at home to help reduce carbon emissions on the island.",
      "\"How can you, as young people in Barbados, help make a difference on climate change?\" he asked them.",
      "Following an engaging and lively debate, I asked the pupils how they felt about Barbados being on the front line of global climate change, despite having only a small carbon footprint itself.",
      "\"Personally, I take a very pessimistic view,\" said 17-year-old Isabella Fredricks.",
      "\"We are a very small country. No matter how hard we try to change, if the big countries \u2013 the main producers of pollution like America, India and China \u2013 don't make a change, everything we do is going to be pointless.\"",
      "Her classmate, Tenusha Ramsham, is slightly more optimistic.",
      "\"I think that all great big leaps in history were made when people collaborated and innovated,\" she argues. \"I don't think we should be completely disheartened because research, innovation, creating technology and education will ultimately lead to the future that we want.\"",
      "\"I feel if we can communicate to the global superpowers the pain that we feel seeing this happen to our environment,\" adds 16-year-old Adrielle Baird, \"then it would help them to understand and help us collaborate to find ways to fix the issues that we're seeing.\"",
      "For the island's young people, their very futures are at stake. Rising sea levels now pose an existential threat to the small islands of the Caribbean.",
      "It is a point on which the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, has become a global advocate for change \u2013 urging greater action over an impending climate catastrophe in her speech at COP29 and calling for economic compensation from the world's industrialised nations.",
      "On its shores and in its seas, it feels like Barbados is under siege - dealing with issues from coral bleaching to coastal erosion. While the impetus for action comes from the island's youth, it is the older generations who have borne witness as the changes unfold.",
      "Steven Bourne has fished the waters around Barbados his whole life and lost two boats in Hurricane Beryl. As we look out at the coastline from a dilapidated beach-hut bar, he says the island's sands have shifted before his very eyes.",
      "\"It's an attack from the elements. You see it taking the beaches away, but years ago you'd be sitting here, and you could see the water's edge coming upon the sand. Now you can't because the sand's built up so much.\"",
      "By coincidence, in the same bar where I chatted to Steven was Home Affairs Minister Wilfred Abrahams, who has responsibility for national disaster management.",
      "I put it to him that it must be a a difficult time for disaster management in the Caribbean.",
      "\"The whole landscape has changed entirely,\" he replied. \"Once upon a time, it was rare to get a Category Five hurricane in any year. Now we're getting them every year. So the intensity and the frequency are cause for concern.\"",
      "Even the duration of the hurricane season has changed, he says.",
      "\"We used to have a rhyme that went: June, too soon; July, standby; October, all over,\" he tells me. Extreme weather events like Beryl have rendered such an idea obsolete.",
      "\"What we can expect has changed, what we've prepared for our whole lives and what our culture is built around has changed,\" he adds.",
      "Fisherman Steven Bourne had hoped to retire before Beryl. Now, he says, he and the rest of the islanders have no choice but to keep going.",
      "\"Being afraid or anything like that don't make no sense. Because there's nowhere for we to go. We love this rock. And we will always be on this rock.\"",

      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",

      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",

      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",

    "summary": "Growers find that the changing climate is having a big impact on the size of their harvests.",
    "story": [
      "In the lush, volcanic highlands of Komothai in central Kenya, farmers like Simon Macharia produce coffee on small plantations scattered across the hillsides.",
      "Along with other farmers, Mr Macharia brings sacks of his bright red coffee cherries to the local processing plant, where they are weighed and treated.",
      "A machine removes the red husks, and the pale beans inside are washed and passed along concrete channels, ending up on lines of drying platforms that sweep across the valley.",
      "Here, workers categorise the beans into grades, the highest destined for the coffee houses of Europe.",
      "\"We call coffee the black gold around here,\" Mr Macharia, whose farm covers 2.5 hectares (six acres) , told the BBC.",
      "He grows the Kenya AA coffee beans, which are prized worldwide for their high quality, full body, deep aromas and fruity flavour.",
      "The crop has been part of these lush highlands since the late 1890s, when British colonial settlers introduced it.",
      "Now, the area is famous for its unique, top-rated coffee.",
      "Growing the berries is labour intensive - picking, pruning, weeding, spraying, fertilising and transporting the products.",
      "\"Coffee requires your full-time concentration, especially when it starts to bloom,\" Mr Macharia said.",
      "\"From that moment up until the day that you are going to harvest - those six months, your full-time job is on the farm.\"",

      "Coffee price surges to highest on record",
      "A coffee tree is a huge investment for cash-strapped farmers, as it can take four years for the fruits to mature.",
      "The price of a single cup of coffee in a chic European caf\u00e9, typically $4 (\u00a33.20), highlights a stark disparity when compared to the earnings of many Kenyan coffee labourers, who make at most $2.30 a day.",
      "Edita Mwangi, who harvests coffee cherries on the red earth hillside overlooking the processing plant, confirms this.",
      "\"They don't know the poverty we suffer. You have to struggle day and night just to survive,\" she said.",
      "With four children depending on her, Ms Mwangi works six days a week, earning about $1.40 a day.",
      "She has to walk 5km (three miles) to reach the farm where she works.",
      "Farmers feel the trading system between Kenya and Europe - the world's largest coffee market - has been stacked against them for many years.",
      "But now, a new threat looms, jeopardising farmers' ability to make a living - climate change.",
      "Coffee trees are extremely sensitive to small differences in temperature and weather conditions.",
      "They also need specific climatic conditions like humid temperatures and ample rainfall to grow.",
      "\"Climate change is a major challenge for our coffee farmers,\" says John Murigi, the chairman of the Komothai Coffee Society, which represents 8,000 coffee farmers like Mr Macharia.",
      "Cold temperatures and erratic rainfall are having a devastating impact on the delicate coffee plants, said Mr Murigi.",
      "As a result, \"coffee production has decreased over the last few years\".",
      "He added that climate change was intensifying the spread of diseases in coffee plants.",
      "Mr Murigi said there had been a significant increase in coffee leaf miners, bugs that feed on coffee leaves, and coffee berry disease, a destructive fungal infection that can wipe out more than 80% of crops.",
      "To deal with the increasing outbreaks, farmers are resorting to using herbicides and insecticides that can damage soil quality in the long term and also pose health risks.",
      "Farmers use dangerous herbicides like Roundup, which contain glyphosates known to cause cancers - banned in some European countries - to ensure they get a good harvest.",
      "Pest Control Products Board (PCPB) of Kenya, in charge of regulating the use of these products, did not respond to a BBC request for comment.",
      "To produce a single cup of coffee can require up to 140 litres of water - including the water to grow the plants.",
      "But higher temperatures and changing rainfall patterns mean a decreasing water supply for coffee farmers in Kiambu County.",
      "Farmer Joseph Kimani told the BBC that the \"river levels have gone down a lot\" due to erratic weather, such as periods of drought and heavy rains.",
      "He said that because of the lack of rain, farmers are forced to use more river water.",
      "But this increased reliance on river water, driven by the lack of rainfall, may be further straining the already limited water supply.",
      "While Mr Murigi acknowledges the rise in water use by coffee farmers, he denies this is why the river is drying up.",
      "However, with 23 coffee societies in this region, a significant amount of water is clearly being used in the coffee growing process in Kiambu County.",
      "Komothia's story is not unique. As global temperatures and droughts increase, good coffee will become difficult to grow in all parts of the world.",
      "Coffee can only be grown in the \"coffee belt\" - tropical regions around the world in areas typically located at an altitude of between 1,000m and 2,000m.",
      "In recent years, climate change has led to a shortage of global coffee supplies and an increase in the price of coffee due to drought and crop failures in several key coffee-producing nations such as Brazil and Vietnam.",
      "A survey by Fairtrade International, the organisation behind Fairtrade labels, found that 93% of Kenyan coffee farmers are already experiencing the effects of climate change.",
      "The coffee industry in Kenya is a key source of employment, providing jobs for an estimated 150,000 people.",
      "To protect the industry, coffee farmers in areas like Komothai are experimenting with climate adaptation techniques, such as planting trees to provide extra shade for the coffee plants.",
      "Mr Murigi said it is only through addressing both the climate and economic challenges faced by Kenyan coffee farmers that they can have a sustainable future.",
      "However, coffee farmers like Mr Macharia are pessimistic about the industry's future.",

    "summary": "The prime minister writes to regulators including Ofgem and Ofwat for ideas to boost economic growth.",
    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the chancellor and business secretary have written to the UK's main regulators asking them to come up with ideas for reform that could boost economic growth.",
      "They contacted watchdogs, including energy regulator Ofgem and water regulator Ofwat, before Christmas asking them to submit proposals by mid-January.",
      "This comes after figures published earlier this week indicated the UK economy had flatlined between July and September.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the letter \"says all you need to know\" about Sir Keir's government, claiming he has to \"beg his own government to create growth after Labour's damaging Budget\".",
      "UK economy had zero growth between July and September",
      "Get serious on pay in 2025, TUC chief tells ministers",
      "The letter - which is also understood to have been sent to the Environment Agency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and healthcare regulators - was first reported by Sky News.",
      "Signed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, it said ministers believed collaboration to be essential to ensure the regulatory environment became \"more pro-growth and pro-investment\" while respecting the independence of regulators.",
      "The FCA said it would reply in the new year. It added that it had already delivered measures since the summer to support growth, including reforming information that retail investors receive, as well as making proposals to provide better value for money for workplace pensions.",
      "The letter said improving regulation to enable growth and not hold back investment was \"an essential part\" of the government's growth mission.",
      "Economic growth is a principal reason behind many major policy announcements, from Communities Secretary Angela Rayner unveiling reforms to the planning system in order to boost house-building, to the chancellor encouraging more \"sensible risk-taking\" in financial services companies.",
      "This letter is evidence that Sir Keir wants to pull every possible governmental lever to make sure arms-length bodies like regulators, as well as government departments, prioritise helping deliver Labour's mission of achieving the highest sustained economic growth in the G7.",
      "It is also an indication that the prime minister fears regulators can restrain economic growth by imposing obstacles to business activity \u2013 a message typically more associated with Conservative politicians but which Starmer is increasingly putting at the heart of his plans.",
      "In a speech earlier this month, Starmer said that \"the regulators, the blockers and bureaucrats\" were part of an \"alliance of naysayers\" who mean that \"we can't get things done in our country.\"",
      "And in October, addressing a summit of international investors in London, he said: \"We've got to look at regulation across the piece, and where it is needlessly holding back investment\u2026 mark my words, we will get rid of it\".",
      "On the other side of the argument will be groups in various sectors where there is a regulator, who argue that what the government sees as obstacles are in fact necessary rules.",
      "Conservative MP Griffith said that if the prime minister wants the UK to exhibit the fastest growth in the G7, then \"he'd have more luck turning the clock back to before the general election when the UK was growing under the Conservatives\".",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Keir warned MPs it would take some time for people to feel their living standards improve.",
      "This week Reeves also said the challenge was to fix the economy \"after 15 years of neglect is huge\", while shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the figures showed \"growth has tanked on Labour's watch\"."

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:11:08 GMT",
    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",
      "The ramifications, whichever way it goes, will no doubt be far-reaching.",

      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "This has been a miserable year for Boeing. Not only has it struggled to cope with a safety and quality control crisis, it has lost billions of dollars following a strike by workers that paralysed production at two of its biggest factories.",
      "Even its space programme has been in trouble. Two astronauts were left stranded on the International Space Station in June after their Boeing Starliner capsule developed a potential fault, which would have made returning to Earth in it too dangerous.",
      "On top of all this, the company faces a crisis of confidence from within its own ranks, says Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical and economic analyst at industry consultants Leeham Company.",
      "\"People in Boeing don't believe in words from top management any more,\" he says.",
      "Sam Mohawk is a 51-year-old quality assurance investigator at Boeing's factory in Renton near Seattle, a huge plant where the 737 Max is built. It is the company's best-selling aircraft, but one with a chequered safety record.",
      "Earlier this year Mr Mohawk came forward as a whistleblower, claiming that chaos on the factory floor in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic had led to thousands of faulty or \"non-conforming\" parts going missing, and potentially being fitted aboard aircraft that have since been sent to customers.",
      "\"The whole system was just in shambles,\" he says of that period. \"It [had] kind of just broken down.\"",
      "His allegations came to light in June when they were referred to during a congressional hearing in Washington DC into safety failures at the aerospace giant.",
      "During the session, Boeing's top bosses were accused by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of \"strip-mining\" the company for profit and cutting corners on safety in order to boost earnings.",
      "David Calhoun, who was Boeing's chief executive at the time, said he \"didn't recognise\" Mr Hawley's depiction of the company. \"That is not the way we operate,\" Mr Calhoun said back then. \"I am proud of every action we have taken.\"",
      "Since then, Boeing has appointed a new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, who has pledged to \"restore trust\" in the business, overhaul its corporate culture and prioritise the safety of passengers. The company is also in the process of implementing a comprehensive safety and quality plan, which was launched earlier in the year.",
      "But according to Mr Mohawk, who still works at Boeing, the drive to build planes as quickly as possible in order to maximise revenues remains. The accountants, he insists, are \"100%\" running the operation.",
      "\"Nothing has changed,\" says Mr Mohawk. \"Our executives talk to the press and say, 'quality and safety is our number one priority'. But it's just the same.\"",
      "Boeing rejects Mr Mohawk's claims. It insists they have been thoroughly investigated and that none of them were found to be valid.",
      "In a statement, it said: \"Boeing data systems do track parts, including non-conforming parts. The investigations into Mr Mohawk's claims found no evidence that defective parts were installed on Boeing planes, and none of the issues raised affected safety.\"",
      "Another Boeing employee called Nathan (not his real name), who works in the company's Everett factory in Washington state, where the 777 is built, describes low staff morale and corners being cut on the production line. Employees \"don't always follow the rules because they feel the pressure from their manager, and so they are not taking steps to ensure their own safety\", he claims.",
      "But Mike Dunlop, an aerospace industry veteran and author of a book about turning around failing businesses, argues that Boeing has in fact already begun the process of transforming itself by going back to basics.",
      "He believes many of Boeing's problems result from the arrogance of the company's management in the past, as it sought to cut costs in an effort to make more money. Recently, he says, there have been some improvements.",
      "\"I've seen the biggest changes in the company since the 1960s. What Kelly Ortberg is doing is focusing back on their core principles, which is to build airplanes as effectively and safely as possible, and be a reliable supplier to the airlines.\"",
      "Arguably, the market needs Boeing to be healthy. It remains a huge company, employing more than 150,000 people directly, and countless more in supply chains around the world. It is a significant contributor to the US economy.",
      "But some insiders argue that it now has a credibility problem and needs to restore confidence.",
      "Crashes and the 737 Max",
      "Boeing's challenging year began on 5 January with a routine evening flight from Portland International Airport in Oregon to Ontario, California. The plane, a brand-new Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, had taken off minutes earlier and was climbing when something went badly wrong.",
      "\"Er, yeah, we'd like to go down,\" a female voice said over the radio as the crisis erupted at 16,000ft. \"Alaska 1282 declaring an emergency\u2026 we're descending to 10,000\u2026 we're depressurised.\"",
      "Moments earlier on the flight deck, First Officer Emily Wiprud had been exchanging routine messages with air traffic control, then there was a loud bang, a sudden rush of wind and her radio headset was torn off. Air pressure in the aircraft plummeted, as did the temperature.",
      "Ms Wiprud and the captain hurriedly put on oxygen masks, then worked together with calm urgency to bring the damaged aircraft to the ground.",
      "What had happened was deeply disturbing. A panel fitted over an unused emergency exit had not been bolted into place properly and had come away as the plane was climbing, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the incident.",
      "The passengers were still strapped in and no one was seriously hurt. But as investigators pointed out, it could have been much worse.",
      "What made the incident stand out was the fact that the 737 Max was Boeing's newest aircraft and its bestselling model in history.",
      "Since its entry into service, more than 1,600 have been sent to airlines and a further 4,800 are on order. But even before this, its safety record was tarnished.",
      "In late 2018, an aircraft went down in the sea off the coast of Indonesia. Four months later another plane crashed minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. A total of 346 people were killed.",
      "Both accidents were ultimately blamed on a poorly designed piece of flight control software. This had been fitted to address handling quirks on the new plane, and prevent pilots, who were used to earlier versions of the 737, from needing expensive retraining.",
      "In practice, it became active at the wrong time, and forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives, according to investigators.",
      "Did cost cutting 'jeopardise safety'?",
      "Some critics blame these accidents on a focus on the bottom line at the expense of safety. In a statement, The Foundation for Aviation Safety, which is chaired by ex-Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson, said: \"Attention to share price and profit margins alone has proven to be a flawed strategy.\"",
      "In the aftermath of those crashes, the 737 Max was grounded for 20 months as regulators examined every aspect of its design.",
      "The company faced criticism over its corporate culture. A congressional report released in September 2020 found that Boeing's rush to build new aircraft as quickly as possible while cutting costs had \"jeopardised the safety of the flying public\" \u2013 although its findings were described as \"partisan\" by one leading Republican.",
      "The incident in Portland, however, was the result of the failure by Boeing engineers to bolt the door panel back on properly, after it had been removed to repair manufacturing flaws. Yet it placed the company in the spotlight again.",
      "In particular, it drew attention to a series of continuing quality problems that had been occurring behind the scenes at the aircraft-maker and at its main supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which makes a number of large aircraft components including the main body.",
      "These included manufacturing defects affecting parts of fuselages, tail and rudder assemblies, as well as sealants applied as protection against the effect of lightning strikes in central fuel tanks.",
      "But the incident also placed a renewed focus on claims made by whistleblowers from within both companies, who had suggested that the pressure from Boeing to produce aircraft quickly, and ramp up production, had compromised safety on both the 737 and 787 programmes.",
      "The sudden deaths of two other whistleblowers \u2013 John Barnett, who had worked in Boeing's 787 factory in South Carolina, and Josh Dean, who had been employed by Spirit \u2013 generated further headlines in 2024. It resulted in pushing the wider story about Boeing once again into the news.",
      "US politicians made their feelings clear. Richard Blumenthal, head of the Senate subcommittee on investigations said: \"Boeing has put profits and speed of production ahead of quality and safety, and ultimately, that failing is at the core of its current difficulties.\"",
      "The strike that 'cost Boeing $5.5 billion'",
      "After the Portland incident, Boeing was ordered by the US Department of Transportation to produce a comprehensive action plan \"to address its systemic quality control and production issues\".",
      "The aerospace giant responded by publishing a detailed strategy aimed at improving its production systems, gaining more control over its supply chain, and encouraging employees to speak up on safety and quality control issues.",
      "It also promised to strengthen its training programmes and overhaul critical processes on the production line.",
      "On 1 July, Boeing reached an agreement to take control of Spirit as part of its efforts to resolve quality problems.",
      "There were also changes at the top of the company when Mr Calhoun, who had become chief executive a year after the incidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia, stepped down and was replaced in August by Mr Ortberg, a veteran engineer who had spent decades in the industry.",
      "But weeks after his appointment, Boeing faced further crisis when more than 30,000 unionised workers - most of them in the company's Washington State heartlands - went on strike over a new four-year contract, and how much Boeing would increase pay and other benefits for its workers.",
      "The walkout, which began in September and lasted for seven weeks, held up production of the 737 Max, the 777 and the 767 freighter.",
      "In the past, the company had become accustomed to negotiating from a position of strength, only this time it was in a weak position, and according to Bjorn Fehrm, employees were out for revenge.",
      "\"It was obvious to them that the old management had basically screwed them. That was the sentiment. They were absolutely disgusted with how they had been treated in the old contract,\" he explains.",
      "The result was a bitter dispute, at a time when the company was trying to instil a new working culture, and Mr Ortberg had promised to \"reset\" relations with its employees.",
      "Boeing had to dig deep to come up with a deal that satisfied their demands, which included a 38% pay rise over four years. According to consultants Anderson Economic Group, the strike cost the company more than $5.5 billion.",
      "Airbus versus Boeing: the fallout",
      "All of this came at a time when the aerospace giant was already struggling financially. In the first nine months of 2024 it racked up losses of nearly $8bn (\u00a36.3bn). As a result, it set out plans to cut 17,000 jobs, or a tenth of its workforce.",
      "Boeing's problems have taken a heavy toll on its business. Where once it went toe to toe with its European rival Airbus, it has now delivered fewer aircraft in each of the past five years.",
      "In the first nine months of 2024 it distributed 291 planes to its customers, while Airbus provided 497, according to Forecast International.",
      "For its customers, this has been frustrating. Ryanair, one of the biggest buyers of the 737 Max, has cut its growth forecasts for next year. In the US, Southwest Airlines has had to make job cuts.",
      "Yet Airbus is not in a position to take full advantage of this. Its own order books are full to bursting, with a backlog of nearly 8,700 planes. Like its rival, it has experienced problems with suppliers, leading to delays.",
      "Meanwhile, airlines want new planes. Estimates from both Boeing and Airbus suggest more than 40,000 new aircraft will be needed over the next two decades.",
      "The current generation of aircraft are much more efficient and cheaper to run than their predecessors. So delays in renewing their fleets will cost airlines money \u2013 potentially leading to higher ticket prices for their passengers - as well as hampering efforts to improve their environmental performance.",
      "According to Mr Fehrm, all this creates an opening for a third player to take a stake in the market. \"Over the next five to 10 years there will be a gap between what the market is asking for and what Airbus and Boeing can deliver by thousands of aircraft.",
      "\"So it's open for a third player. Brazilian manufacturer Embraer is a candidate. Or it's going to be a chance for Comac, the Chinese supplier, to come into different markets and say, 'Actually, we can do a decent job here.'\"",
      "A 'borderline miraculous' revival?",
      "In early December Mike Whitaker, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), visited the factory in Renton near Seattle that Mr Mohawk has raised concerns about. At the time, Mr Whitaker said: \"What's truly needed is a fundamental cultural shift that's oriented around safety, quality improvement and effective employee engagement and training.",
      "\"As expected, Boeing has made progress executing its comprehensive plan in these areas, and we will continue to closely monitor the results as they begin to ramp up production following the strike.\"",
      "But for many experts, the problems at Boeing go back decades \u2013 and are unlikely to be solved overnight.",
      "\"The hardest thing to change in large companies is the mindset of people,\" says Mr Fehrm. \"It takes time, and it needs to be manifested in actions, doing things differently.",
      "\"There are changes coming, but people won't look at what the top management under Kelly Ortberg say. They will look for actions.\"",
      "Some observers believe Mr Ortberg has an opportunity now to improve the company's fortunes. Mr Dunlop thinks a change in mindset will be fundamental to Boeing's future.",
      "\"The fastest way to turn around a company is to have a complete change in attitude on how you treat your employees, how you treat your customers, and most importantly in how you treat your suppliers.\"",
      "A complete reversal of its previous approach could produce a \"borderline miraculous\" revival, he believes.",
      "But others are less confident. Captain Dennis Tajer, the lead spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association (the pilots' union for American Airlines), believes real change at Boeing has to come, not from the boardroom, but from further down the company's ranks.",
      "\"The solution is below senior management,\" he argues.",
      "\"It's at the middle management level, where you find the gatekeepers and the people who support doing things properly, not just keeping the schedule going.\"",
      "The stakes, he insists, could not be higher.",

    "story": [
      "Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has died at the age of 92.",
      "Singh was one of India's longest-serving prime ministers and he was considered the architect of key liberalising economic reforms, as premier from 2004-2014 and before that as finance minister.",
      "He had been admitted to a hospital in the capital Delhi after his health condition deteriorated, reports say.",
      "Among those who paid tribute to Singh on Thursday were Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wrote on social media that \"India mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders\".",
      "Modi said that Singh's \"wisdom and humility were always visible\" during their interactions and that he had \"made extensive efforts to improve people's lives\" during his time as prime minister.",
      "Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and a Congress party member, said that Singh was \"genuinely egalitarian, wise, strong-willed and courageous until the end\".",
      "Her brother Rahul, who leads Congress, said he had \"lost a mentor and guide\".",
      "Singh was the first Indian leader since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after serving a full first term, and the first Sikh to hold the country's top post. He made a public apology in parliament for the 1984 riots in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed.",
      "But his second term in office was marred by a string of corruption allegations that dogged his administration. The scandals, many say, were partially responsible for his Congress party's crushing defeat in the 2014 general election.",
      "Singh was born on 26 September 1932, in a desolate village in the Punjab province of undivided India, which lacked both water and electricity.",
      "After attending Panjab University he took a master's degree at the University of Cambridge and then a DPhil at Oxford.",
      "While studying at Cambridge, the lack of funds bothered Singh, his daughter, Daman Singh, wrote in a book on her parents.",
      "\"His tuition and living expenses came to about \u00a3600 a year. The Panjab University scholarship gave him about \u00a3160. For the rest he had to depend on his father. Manmohan was careful to live very stingily. Subsidised meals in the dining hall were relatively cheap at two shillings sixpence.\"",
      "Daman Singh remembered her father as \"completely helpless about the house and could neither boil an egg, nor switch on the television\".",
      "Consensus builder",
      "Singh rose to political prominence as India's finance minister in 1991, taking over as the country was plunging into bankruptcy.",
      "His unexpected appointment capped a long and illustrious career as an academic and civil servant - he served as an economic adviser to the government, and became the governor of India's central bank.",
      "In his maiden speech as finance minister he famously quoted Victor Hugo, saying that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come\".",
      "That served as a launchpad for an ambitious and unprecedented economic reform programme: he cut taxes, devalued the rupee, privatised state-run companies and encouraged foreign investment.",
      "The economy revived, industry picked up, inflation was checked and growth rates remained consistently high in the 1990s.",
      "'Accidental PM'",
      "Manmohan Singh was a man acutely aware of his lack of a political base. \"It is nice to be a statesman, but in order to be a statesman in a democracy you first have to win elections,\" he once said.",
      "When he tried to win election to India's lower house in 1999, he was defeated. He sat instead in the upper house, chosen by his own Congress party.",
      "The same happened in 2004, when Singh was first appointed prime minister after Congress president Sonia Gandhi turned down the post - apparently to protect the party from damaging attacks over her Italian origins. Critics however alleged that Sonia Gandhi was the real source of power while he was prime minister, and that he was never truly in charge.",
      "The biggest triumph during his first five-year term was to bring India out of nuclear isolation by signing a landmark deal securing access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal came at a price - the government's Communist allies withdrew support after protesting against it, and Congress had to make up lost numbers by enlisting the support of another party amid charges of vote-buying.",
      "A consensus builder, Singh presided over a coalition of sometimes difficult, assertive and potentially unruly regional coalition allies and supporters.",
      "Although he earned respect for his integrity and intelligence, he also had a reputation for being soft and indecisive. Some critics claimed that the pace of reform slowed and he failed to achieve the same momentum he had while finance minister.",
      "When Singh guided Congress to a second, decisive election victory in 2009, he vowed that the party would \"rise to the occasion\".",
      "But the gloss soon began to wear off and his second term was in the news mostly for all the wrong reasons: several scandals involving his cabinet ministers which allegedly cost the country billions of dollars, a parliament stalled by the opposition, and a huge policy paralysis that resulted in a serious economic downturn.",
      "LK Advani, a senior leader in the rival BJP party, called Singh India's \"weakest prime minister\".",

      "Pragmatic foreign policy",
      "Singh adopted the pragmatic foreign policies pursued by his two predecessors.",
      "He continued the peace process with Pakistan - though this process was hampered by attacks blamed on Pakistani militants, culminating in the Mumbai gun and bomb attack of November 2008.",
      "He tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "Singh increased financial support for Afghanistan and became the first Indian leader to visit the country for nearly 30 years.",
      "He also angered many opposition politicians by appearing to end relations with India's old ally, Iran.",
      "A low-profile leader",
      "A studious former academic and bureaucrat, he was known for being self-effacing and always kept a low profile. His social media account was noted mostly for dull entries and had a limited number of followers.",
      "A man of few words, his calm demeanour nevertheless won him many admirers.",
      "Responding to questions on a coal scandal involving the illegal allocation of licences worth billions of dollars, he defended his silence on the issue by saying it was \"better than thousands of answers\".",
      "In 2015 he was summoned to appear in court to answer allegations of criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and corruption related offences. An upset Singh told reporters that he was \"open for legal scrutiny\" and that the \"truth will prevail\".",
      "After his time as premier, Singh remained deeply engaged with the issues of the day as a senior leader of the main opposition Congress party despite his advancing age.",
      "In August 2020, he told the BBC in a rare interview that India needed to take three steps \"immediately\" to stem the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic, which had sent the country's economy into a recession.",

    "story": [
      "The government has urged video platforms like YouTube to feature \"high-quality\" children's content more prominently on their websites.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy warned young people are less likely to see programmes which are educational or provide \"emotional and mental wellbeing\" development as they increasingly watch via online platforms rather than traditional television.",
      "Nandy said she had written to YouTube and similar platforms, as well as the regulator Ofcom, urging them to increase the visibility of suitable children's material.",
      "A YouTube spokesperson said it \"provides kids and teens with safe, age appropriate online experiences that allow them to learn, grow and explore\".",
      "But Nandy, who has a nine-year-old child, said online platforms were failing to promote the \"widest range\" of material. \"[It's] something that affects my family, like every family around the country,\" she added.",
      "She was speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which was guest-edited on Monday by actor and Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Floella Benjamin, who has starred in several children's shows over a decades-long entertainment career.",
      "Nandy praised UK-produced children's TV, saying it \"helps inform [children] about the world\", but said online users often do not see it because it is not promoted by popular websites.",
      "She said the government is ready to support the UK's \"crown jewels\" children's TV industry but a previous government-led funding scheme found that while more quality content was created, children \"weren't necessarily watching it and we think that's because children were not able to find it\".",
      "The government is seeking a voluntary agreement with online platforms, Nandy said, but signalled the government would be willing to take further action if one can not be reached.",
      "She continued: \"The intention is that we would much prefer for them to work with us to make sure children are able to see and find high-quality content much more easily.",
      "\"There's something great about YouTube. It's democratising, you've got these people who can start their careers from their bedrooms - and we're very well aware of that but there is a balance to be struck here.\"",
      "She urged Ofcom to \"prioritise children's television\" as part of their public service broadcasting review, which is due to report in the summer.",
      "Benjamin said \"television influences children's thinking and behaviour\" but warned its \"quality and quantity\" are in decline.",

      "Bridget Phillipson defended the government ending the exemption from Wednesday.",
      "Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, she said \"very few families\" would leave the schools as a result. Separately, she told the Sunday Times she had the support of middle-class parents as they had already been \"priced out\" of private education.",
      "The Conservatives labelled the decision a \"vindictive policy that will worsen the education of every single child, regardless of the school they are educated in\".",
      "The policy was outlined by the Chancellor Rachel Reeves during the autumn Budget.",
      "The money raised would go towards investing in state schools and teacher recruitment, Phillipson wrote in the Telegraph. She added that \u00a31.8bn would be raised a year by 2029-30.",
      "But the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents most of the UK's private schools, said the money the government claimed it would raise was an \"estimate, not a fact\".",
      "\"The negative effects of this unprecedented tax on education will be felt by families and children across state and independent schools,\" the ISC's chief executive, Julie Robinson said on Sunday.",
      "Ms Robinson added that they are not alone in predicting that the policy \"could cost the treasury money and would damage state education\" due to the cost of educating more children in the sector.",
      "Approximately 93% of children in the UK currently attend state schools, Phillipson said.",
      "The government has pledged to recruit 6,500 more teachers funded by the money raised in the policy, Phillipson said.",
      "She added that \"high-quality\" teaching has the biggest impact on children's learning, but that \"in some key subjects the teacher pipeline has been running dry\".",
      "Schools have been struggling to hire teachers in maths, science, and design and technology, she said.",
      "Phillipson added that \"very few\" families would move out of private schools, according to the government's impact assessment.",
      "In October however, the ISC said some private schools reported a 4.6% drop in pupil attendance in secondary school uptake, which it attributed to parents now deciding against sending their children to private school.",
      "Acknowledging the policy as an area \"where feelings run high\", Phillipson said that some of the conversations around it have been \"scaremongering\".",
      "She also told the Sunday Times that she had received abuse over the policy, but would wear it as a \"badge of honour\" if it meant driving up the standards of state schools.",
      "She added that the policy was supported by \"middle-class parents in good professional jobs with housing costs [who] just can't afford that level of fee\" and want \"brilliant state schools\".",
      "Emphasising the importance of investment into state schools in her Telegraph piece, Phillipson said raising the standards of such establishments was the \"route to better life chances\u2026 and a stronger society and economy\".",
      "A Conservative spokesperson added: \"The idea that middle-class parents support this bitter policy is simply not true.",

      "Here, in his own words, James speaks about his hopes for the future for his teenage sons.",
      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",
      "When my eldest son Jude was a baby, he was slow to crawl and didn't respond to his name. He used to stare out of the window, he was quite distant and almost in a different world.",
      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",

      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",
      "'We decided to split the boys up'",
      "Unfortunately at the time Tommy was a huge trigger for him because he was loud and unpredictable. His self-harming would scare Tommy so we used to have to keep them apart a lot.",

      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",

      "There have been times he's been too anxious to do that and we were housebound but at the moment he's doing OK.",
      "Tommy is 13, and he is cheeky, mischievous, funny, and curious about everything around him. He loves looking at books and puzzles. He isn't fully verbal but he uses a communication device.",
      "I recently had one of the best days I've ever had with Jude and Tommy.",

      "Nine years ago I began sharing stories from our lives online, on a weekly blog. Then I started Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok accounts.",
      "It was initially a way to show friends and family what our life was really like. Jude and Tommy struggled with social occasions, so we stopped going.",
      "I could never find the words to explain, and I wanted to show how proud I was of them, so I started writing instead.",
      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",

      "I don't know what the future will look like, but I know I need to think about how to help them live as independently as they can, and prepare for the days when I'm not here.",

      "The number of Scottish pupils passing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) subjects is \"very worrying\", according to a report by education experts.",
      "The Commission on School Reform analysed exam pass rates for secondary pupils taking National 5 subjects with data going back to 2015.",
      "It said 40.1% of all fourth year pupils - typically aged 14-16 years old - had passed National 5 mathematics in 2024, while 75.2% passed English. Just over 25% passed the most popular science subject, biology.",
      "The Scottish government said that not all pupils sit National 5 exams in S4.",
      "And it pointed out that 68% of the pupils in all school years who sat Nat 5 maths in 2024 had passed, an increase of 5.7 percentage points from the previous year.",
      "The Commission on School Reform is an independent group of education experts, set up by think tank Reform Scotland.",
      "Its latest report analysed SQA exam data for the total number of pupils in S4, as well as the number who took each subject.",
      "The report said the \"real\" pass rate - for all S4 pupils - was:",
      "40.1% in mathematics25.9% in biology22.5% in chemistry17.9% in physics9.8% in computing science",
      "40.1% in mathematics",

      "Former Kilmarnock Academy headteacher and member of the commission, Carole Ford, said the data laid bare that there was a \"mountain to climb\".",
      "She said the results of the international Pisa survey in 2023 had already shown that Scotland's outcomes in maths and science were \"very poor\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Ms Ford said issues like staffing could be a contributing factor to the reason for the decline in student performance, but Scotland does not collect enough data to examine the true cause.",
      "She said: \"One of the things that the Scottish government said was they felt that the drop in the number doing maths in particular was because we support a curriculum of pupil choice.",
      "\"Pupils are choosing subjects on the basis of where they are most likely to succeed and that's even more concerning because we have to ask ourselves, why do fewer pupils now expect to succeed in maths and in stem subjects?",
      "\"For society as whole, this is not good news. Society develops on the back of an educated population and not having the level of education in sciences and mathematics that other countries do will be to Scotland's disadvantage.\"",
      "'Not good enough'",
      "Chair of Reform Scotland and former Labour first minister Lord Jack McConnell said it was \"very worrying\" that less than half of Scotland's 16-year-olds had passed National 5 maths.",
      "He added:  \"If our economic future is to be based around industries like renewable energy and health sciences, improving our pass rates in mathematics and the sciences is a matter of critical national importance.",
      "\"The deficit in our Stem pass rates revealed by this research is not good enough.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Scottish government said pupils, parents and teachers at individual schools are best placed to decide at what age national qualifications are taken.",
      "They added: \"They are best-placed to determine the correct pathway for each young person and this flexibility and child-centred approach has been a key feature of Curriculum for Excellence for many years.",
      "\"One of the most important aspects of such decisions is that young people are entered at the level of qualification at which they have the best chance of achieving success.\"",
      "These figures demonstrate the way in which the senior phase in secondary schools operates.",
      "The emphasis is on what a student has achieved by the time they leave school - not what they have obtained at the end of a particular school year.",
      "The overwhelming majority of students - not just the academically able - now remain in school until S6.",
      "Some students may not obtain a National 5 qualification in maths in S4 but go on to get one in S5.",
      "Another factor is worth considering too.",
      "Once English and maths, or at least arithmetic, were effectively compulsory for students in S4.",
      "Now they are often just options, albeit relatively popular ones.",
      "This reflects how many schools only allow students to do a maximum of six National 4 or 5 courses in S4.",
      "There are several issues worthy of discussion.",
      "One is whether young people at all schools should have the chance to obtain more than 6 qualifications in S4.",
      "Another is whether certain subjects should, in effect, be mandatory as was once the case. (Until the 1980s any student with a reasonable prospect of passing was expected to do O Grade English and Maths. From the late 80s on, most would study Standard Grade courses in these subjects at the appropriate level.)",
      "If, however, compulsion is not the answer some supporters of particular subjects may want to consider if more can be done to make them attractive options which a greater number of students might positively choose."

      "From Taylor Swift to Charli XCX, women had a record-breaking year on the British charts, according to new figures from the British Phonographic Institute (BPI).",
      "Female pop artists topped the singles chart for an unprecedented 34 weeks - the highest ever figure.",
      "Twenty-one of those weeks belonged to Sabrina Carpenter, whose hit singles Espresso, Taste and Please, Please, Please dominated the second half of the year.",
      "Women were also responsible for half of the year's biggest-selling albums, with Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department leading the pack.",
      "A break-up album full of caustic kiss-offs and sober reflection, it accumulated more than 783,000 sales by the end of December - more than any artist has managed in a calendar year since Ed Sheeran's \u00f7 sold 2.7 million copies in 2017.",
      "Swift had another three albums among the year's 20 biggest titles: 1989 (Taylor's Version), Lover and Folklore.",
      "There were also places in the year-end top 20 for albums Billie Eilish's Hit Me Hard And Soft, Sabrina Carpenter's Short N' Sweet, Chappell Roan's The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess and Charli XCX's Brat - all of which have been nominated for album of the year at the 2025 Grammy Awards.",
      "Brat, whose brash and aggressive dance anthems became a cultural phenomenon, was also one of 12 albums by female artists to top the Official Albums Chart in 2024 (equalling a record set in 2023).",
      "These included Prelude To Ecstasy, the debut album by BBC Sound of 2024 winners The Last Dinner Party; as well as new releases by Dua Lipa, Ariana Grande and Beyonc\u00e9.",
      "Overall, music consumption in the UK rose by 9.7%, with fans buying or streaming 200.5 million albums (the BPI counts 1,000 streams as the equivalent of one album \"sale\").",
      "Streaming hit a record high, with 199.6 billion songs played over the course of the year.",
      "That's the equivalent of everyone in the country playing 2,920 tracks, or six continuous days of music, on services like Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music.",
      "Vinyl sales marked a 17th consecutive year of growth, with 6.7 million records bought. And the decline in CD sales showed signs of slowing down, with purchases falling by just 2.9% to 10.5 million units.",
      "However, the availability of millions of songs at the touch of a button is making it harder for British musicians to compete.",
      "For the first time since records began in 1970, none of the year's top 10 best-selling songs was by an artist from the UK.",
      "Instead, the chart was dominated by US singer-songwriters, including Noah Kahan, whose breakthrough hit Stick Season notched up a total of 1.99m sales (including streams) over the year.",
      "Benson Boone's Beautiful Things took second place, while Sabrina Carpenter's summer anthem Espresso came third.",
      "The biggest-selling song by a Brit was Myles Smith's folk-pop stomper Stargazing, which came twelfth.",
      "BPI chief executive Dr Jo Twist acknowledged it was \"undoubtedly becoming much harder\" for British musicians to cut through in a \"hyper-competitive global music economy\".",
      "\"British artists have perhaps enjoyed stronger years overall,\" she told the BBC, \"but plenty of UK talent ranging from Charli XCX, Dua Lipa, and Coldplay to The Last Dinner Party, Beabadoobee, and rising star Myles Smith, have had brilliant years.",
      "\"We shouldn't forget that music is cyclical or that some of our major artists have not been active and can be expected to return in 2025 with new material.",
      "\"So I think we can be optimistic and look upon it as a 'blip' for now, but without becoming complacent.\"",
      "The BPI also noted that emerging music superpowers in Latin America and South Korea often receive government backing, and urged the UK to protect and support its own music industry.",
      "In particular, it raised concerns over proposed changes to the UK's copyright law, which it claimed \"would allow international tech giants to train AI models on artists' work without payment or permission\".",
      "\"The UK remains a world music power, but this status cannot be taken for granted,\" said Dr Twist.",
      "\"We need a supportive policy environment that puts the focus on human artistry and enables continued investment in the next generation of British talent.\""

      "\"New Year's Eve is such a big deal, and I don't take it lightly if people are choosing to spend it with us,\" she confides.",

      "And 2025 will, of course, start with Murder on the Dancefloor, \"but after a little bit of Auld Lang Syne,\" she clarifies.",

      "They will be duetting on two of Scissor Sisters' best-known tracks, including Take Your Mama, which will feature what Ellis-Bexter describes as \"an epic guitar solo\" by Emily Roberts, from the Brit-winning group The Last Dinner Party.",
      "\"I'm a massive fan of their band,\" she says, having covered their song Nothing Matters for the Radio One Live Lounge back in February.",
      "Indeed, indie music is where Ellis-Bexter started out. She first made the charts in 1998 as lead singer of theaudience, a band who made up for their lack of capital letters and use of the space bar with a couple of rather catchy Smiths influenced post-Britpop top 40 hits.",

      "\"It's so important to identify early because it's treatable,\" Gadot continued. \"While rare, it's a possibility, and knowing it exists is the first step to addressing it.",
      "\"Sharing this is not meant to frighten anyone but to empower. If even one person feels compelled to take action for their health because of this story, it will have been worth sharing.\"",
      "A blood clot is rare in pregnancy, but the slowing of blood flow during pregnancy and just after giving birth increases the risk.",

      "The study suggested there are a number of factors for the increase, mainly the use of oral contraceptives, but being heavily pregnant or being within six weeks after giving birth are also possible factors (between 5% and 20% of cases).",
      "Pregnancy also increases the risk of other forms of clots such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), usually in the legs, and pulmonary embolism, when part of a clot travels to the lungs."

    "summary": "Women-led Indian films have made a splash across the world this year, including at major festivals.",
    "story": [
      "In 2024, as Bollywood struggled to find its footing, smaller films by Indian women that told nuanced stories made headlines in the country and across the world.",
      "In May, Indian filmmaker Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light made history by winning the Grand Prix at the Cannes film festival.",
      "In the months since then, All We Imagine As Light has become a juggernaut of indie cinema, sweeping through film festivals and the awards circuit. It has been judged the Best International film by prestigious associations including the New York Film Critics Circle and the Toronto Film Critics Association. It has also picked up two Golden Globe nominations, including for Ms Kapadia as best director.",
      "It is also on several best films of the year list, including that of the BBC and the New York Times.",
      "And it has company.",
      "Director Shuchi Talati's coming-of-age drama Girls Will Be Girls won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival. Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies (Lost Ladies) spent at least two months on the top 10 list of Netflix in India and was picked as the country's official Oscar entry (a controversial decision). Laapataa Ladies didn't make it to the Academy's shortlist. What did make it was British-Indian director Sandhya Suri's Hindi film Santosh, which had been picked as the UK's submission to the Oscars.",
      "Is this sudden wave of success for Indian films an aberration or a long-awaited shift in global consciousness?",
      "\"It's a culmination of both,\" says film critic Shubhra Gupta, pointing out that these films were not \"made overnight\".",
      "For instance, Shuchi Talati, the director of Girls Will Be Girls, and its co-producer Richa Chadha were in college together when they first came up with the idea for the film. \"They have been working on it for years,\" Gupta says.",
      "\"It's pure serendipity that 2024 became the year these films were released, igniting conversations together.\"",
      "This fortunate alignment has been a cinematic dream. The global impact of these films is rooted in their quality and exploration of universal themes like loneliness, relationships, identity, gender and resilience. With strong female voices and unconventional feminist narratives, these stories venture into territories unexplored by mainstream Indian cinema.",
      "In All We Imagine As Light, a film made in the Hindi, Marathi and Malayalam languages, three migrant women in Mumbai navigate empathy, resilience and human connection. The narrative delves into themes of loneliness and the socio-political landscape, notably the scrutiny of interfaith Hindu-Muslim relationships as seen with the character Anu (Divya Prabha) and her bond with Shiaz (Hridhu Haroon).",
      "Kapadia told the BBC that while the women in her films are financially independent, they still face limitations in their personal lives, particularly when it comes to matters of love.",
      "\"For me, love in India is very political\u2026 women seem to hold a lot of the so-called honour of the family and the protection of the caste lineage. So if she marries somebody who is of a different religion or of a different caste, that becomes an issue. For me, it is really a method to control women and infantilise them,\" she says.",
      "Talati's Girls Will Be Girls explores female adolescence, rebellion and intergenerational conflict through the story of a 16-year-old girl studying at a strict boarding school in the Himalayas and her fractured relationship with her mother, Anila, who struggles with her own vulnerabilities and unresolved emotions.",
      "\"It is the kind of coming-of-age film that we don't do in India at all,\" Gupta says. \"It looks at women from a very empathetic, very warm gaze.\"",
      "\"The age where people experience emotions with and without their bodies, their minds, that exploration but without infantilising the experience - it was never part of Indian mainstream cinema,\" she adds.",
      "Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies did not perform well at the box-office but got warm reviews from viewers and critics. At a BAFTA screening in London this month, Ms Rao described the current moment as \"really special for women from India\", expressing hope for a continued wave of such stories.",
      "Her film is a satirical comedy about two newlywed brides getting accidentally swapped on a train because of their veils. It offers a sharp commentary on patriarchy, identity and gender roles, a shift from decades of male-centred mainstream Indian films.",
      "\"A lot of us who are very patriarchal in our thinking are often that way because that's how we have been brought up,\" Bollywood star Aamir Khan, a co-producer of the film, said after the screening. \"But we need to be understanding, at least try and help each other even to come out of this kind of thinking.\"",
      "The biggest surprise this year came from the UK, which selected the Hindi-language film Santosh, directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri, as its Oscar entry. Shot entirely in India over a 44-day schedule, it featured a largely female crew. Starring Indian actors Shahana Goswami and Sunita Rajbhar, Santosh was co-produced by people and companies across the UK, India, Germany and France.",
      "The film is intrinsically an Indian story about violence against women, set as a taut thriller.",
      "Goswami says the success of Santosh and All We Imagine as Light points to the merging of borders and expansion of film industries, creating space for cross-pollination and exchange.",
      "\"We often think these Indian films require [specific] cultural context, but they don't. Any film driven by emotion will resonate universally, regardless of its origins,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Three of the films - All We Imagine as Light, Girls Will Be Girls and Santosh - share one more common trait: they are cross-country co-productions.",
      "Goswami agrees that this could this be a formula for the future.",
      "\"With a French producer, for example, a film gains the opportunity to be seen by a French audience who may follow that producer or the broader film industry. This is how it becomes more globally accessible and relevant,\" she says.",
      "Even in Bollywood, some women-led films have had huge success this year. Stree 2, a horror-comedy about a mysterious woman battling a monster who abducts free-thinking women, was the year's second-biggest hit, playing in cinemas for months.",
      "On streaming platforms, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's opulent Netflix series Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, an exploration of the misogyny and exploitation in the lives of courtesans in pre-independent India, was among Google's top-searched TV shows of the year.",
      "Their success seems to signal a growing appetite for such stories, their broad appeal demonstrating that mainstream cinema can address important themes without sacrificing entertainment value.",
      "Despite systemic challenges, 2024 has highlighted the global power of female voices from India and the demand for diverse stories. The momentum could be crucial for the Indian film industry in getting wider distribution for its independent films and pave the way for a more diverse and equitable film landscape."

      "But when Payne fell to his death, Cassidy had already left the country.",
      "What happened on the day he died?",
      "Payne had been staying in the upmarket Casa Sur hotel for three days before his death.",
      "Payne's friend Roger Nores was at the hotel with him but left at 16:11 local time (20:11 BST) on 16 October, Argentine prosecutors have said.",
      "Payne was then in the hotel lobby and was unable to stand \"due to the consumption of various substances\", they said.",
      "At 16:54, cameras recorded him being dragged unconscious by three people - led by chief receptionist Esteban Grassi - and taken to his room, according to prosecutors.",
      "Grassi called emergency services at about 17:00, with requests to respond to a hotel guest \"who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" and \"destroying his room\".",
      "\"I don't know if the guest's life is in danger. But he has a room with a balcony and we're a little afraid that he might do something life-threatening,\" Grassi said in a second call.",

      "It is thought he fell from the balcony at about 17:07 local time.",
      "Police arrived minutes later. Hotel staff told them a loud sound had been heard in the courtyard, where Payne's body was discovered.",
      "He was pronounced dead at the scene, with the emergency services saying there had been \"no possibility of resuscitation\".",
      "Police say they found his room in \"total disorder\". Local media later published pictures purportedly from his room, showing a TV with a broken screen, multiple bottles, cans, candles, aluminium foil and a half-full glass of champagne.",
      "What have official tests revealed?",
      "An autopsy, which was carried out that evening, established that Payne suffered \"multiple traumas\" and \"internal and external haemorrhaging\", with 25 injuries that were \"consistent with a fall from a great height\".",
      "On 7 November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his body.",
      "They also ruled out self-harm or physical intervention by a third party.",
      "They said Payne didn't adopt a posture to protect himself from the fall. That, along with other information, led them to conclude he was unconscious or semi-conscious when he fell.",
      "They ruled out \"a conscious or voluntary act\", saying he didn't know what he was doing or didn't understand it.",
      "However, following a further forensic report and an inspection of the scene on 5 December, a judge said that, in his state of intoxication, Payne \"tried to leave the room through the balcony\" and fell to his death.",

      "And that probably won't be the last record that will be broken.",
      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",
      "James says he's seen nothing to suggest that it will - yet - but if things stay quiet it's time to start worrying.",
      "\"If we still have seen absolutely nothing by summer, and certainly if we've seen nothing of it by, say, end of August, then yeah, that's going to 2026,\" he says.",

      "The release of GTA 6 is expected to have an impact on the wider games industry.",

      "He says a big hit - especially one with the cultural resonance of GTA - can get more people \"in the mood to buy video games\" and publishers want to capitalise on that.",
      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",

      "Despite unconfirmed leaks and rumours the machine's capabilities remain a mystery and the company's promised some sort of official announcement by the end of March.",
      "There's a feeling, though, that Nintendo won't want to change the winning formula of the original Switch, which has sold 146 million units since its 2017 launch.",
      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",

      "More breakout hits",

      "\"On the triple-A side a lot of critics and players have said 'it's such a quiet year, there's not many big releases', but for indie games, there's always so many cool things to play.\"",
      "A success like Balatro is incredibly rare, and one of the big issues for indie developers in 2024 has been discoverability - getting players to actually find your game.",
      "Rachel says the number of releases on Steam - the online store where most PC games are bought - is \"frankly bonkers\" and getting noticed is \"one of the most difficult things\".",
      "\"I just don't see that becoming any easier,\" she says.",
      "Rachel says indie developers are also struggling to find investment and the financial outlook is \"pretty bleak\" going into 2025.",
      "But she does think that more gamers are starting to recognise the creativity that exists in the sector - and more breakout hits will follow.",
      "\"The indie space is a place where I retreat to just play games that get me excited about gaming again,\" says Rachel.",

      "Sitting in his house in Memphis, he hit play assuming it was an Asian remake of a beloved American sitcom from the 1980s. It wasn\u2019t until the third episode that he realised they had nothing in common save the name. But he was hooked.",
      "That accidental choice changed his life. Twelve years on, he is an English teacher in South Korea - and he says he loves it here: \u201cI have got to try all the foods I\u2019ve seen in K-dramas, and I\u2019ve gotten to see several of the K-pop artists in concerts whose lyrics I used to study Korean.\u201d",
      "When Evan discovered Full House in 2012, South Korean entertainment was a blip in the world\u2019s eye. Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style was the best-known Korean pop export at the time.",
      "Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world \u2013 that\u2019s four times the population of South Korea. Squid Game, Netflix's most popular show ever, has just returned for a much-anticipated second season.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The so-called Korean Wave swept the world, experts say, when the success of streaming met American-inspired production value. And Korean entertainment \u2013 from pop music and mushy dramas to acclaimed hits built around universal themes \u2013 was ready for it.",
      "No more 'Candy girls': The powerful women breaking K-drama barriers",
      "\u2018I lost nine teeth filming Squid Game\u2019: BBC on set with show\u2019s director",
      "BTS and Blackpink are now familiar names on the global pop circuit. People are swooning over sappy K-dramas from Dubai to India to Singapore. Overseas sales of all this Korean content - including video games - is now worth billions.",
      "Last month, after 53-year-old poet and novelist Han Kang won the Nobel Prize for her literature, online boards were full of memes noting South Korea\u2019s \u201cCulture Victory\u201d \u2014 a reference to the popular video game series Civilisation.",
      "And there were jokes about how the country had achieved the dream of founding father Kim Koo, who famously wrote that he wished for Korea to be a nation of culture rather than might.",
      "As it turns out, this moment had been in the making for years.",
      "It's all in the timing",
      "After South Korea\u2019s military dictatorship ended in 1987, censorship was loosened and numerous TV channels launched. Soon, there was a generation of creators who had grown up idolising Hollywood and hip-hop, says Hye Seung Chung, associate professor of Korean Film Studies at the University of Buffalo.",
      "Around the same time, South Korea rapidly grew rich, benefitting from an export boom in cars and electronics. And money from conglomerates, or chaebols as they are known, flowed into film and TV production, giving it a Hollywood-like sheen.",
      "They came to own much of the industry, from production to cinemas. So they were willing to splurge on making movies without worrying much about losses, Prof Chung says.",
      "K-pop, meanwhile, had become a domestic rage in the mid-90s, propelling the success of groups such as HOT and Shinhwa.",
      "This inspired agencies to replicate the gruelling Japanese artist management system.",
      "Scout young talent, often in their teens, and sign them onto years-long contracts through which they become \u201cperfect\u201d idols, with squeaky clean images and hyper-managed public personas. As the system took hold, it transformed K-pop, creating more and more idols.",
      "By the 2000s, Korean TV shows and K-pop were a hit in East and South East Asia. But it was streaming that took them to the world, and into the lives of anyone with a smartphone.",
      "That\u2019s when the recommendation engine took over \u2013 it has been key in initiating Korean culture fans, taking them from one show to the next, spanning different genres and even platforms.",
      "The alien and the familiar",
      "Evan says he binged the 16 hour-long episodes of Full House. He loved the way it took its time to build the romance, from bickering banter to attraction, unlike the American shows he knew.",
      "\u201cI was fascinated by each cultural difference I saw - I noticed that they don\u2019t wear shoes in the house,\u201d he recalls. So he took up Netflix\u2019s suggestions for more Korean romcoms. Soon, he found himself humming to the soundtracks of the shows, and was drawn to K-pop.",
      "He has now begun watching variety shows, a reality TV genre where comedians go through a series of challenges together.",
      "As they work their way through the recommendations, fans are immersed in a world that feels foreign yet familiar \u2013 one that eventually includes kimchi jiggae, a spicy kimchi stew, and kalguksu, a seafood and kelp noodle broth.",
      "When Mary Gedda first visited South Korea, she went looking for a bowl of kimchi jjigae, as she had seen the stars do on screen numerous times.",
      "\u201cI was crying [as I ate it]. It was so spicy,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, why did I order this? They eat it so easily in every show.\u201d",
      "Mary, an aspiring French actor, now lives in Seoul. Originally a K-pop fan, she then discovered K-dramas and learned Korean. She has starred in a few cameo roles as well. \u201cI got lucky and I absolutely love it,\u201d she says.",
      "For Mary, food was a big part of the appeal because she saw such a variety of it on K-dramas. Seeing how characters build relationships over food was familiar to her, she says, because she grew up in the French countryside in Burgundy.",
      "But there is also the promise of romance, which drew Marie Namur to South Korea from her native Belgium. She began watching K-dramas on a whim, after visiting South Korea, but she says she kept going because she was \u201cpretty much attracted to all those beautiful Korean men\u201d.",
      "\"[They] are impossible love stories between a super-rich guy and a girl who is usually poor, and, you know, the guy is there to save her and it really sells you a dream.\"",
      "But it is Korean women who are writing most of these shows \u2013 so it is their imagination, or fantasy, that is capturing the interest (and hearts) of other women across the world.",
      "In Seoul, Marie said she was \u201ctreated like a lady\u201d, which hadn\u2019t happened \u201cin a very long time\u201d, but her \u201cdating experience is not exactly as I expected it to be\u201d.",
      "\u201cI do not want to be a housewife. I want to keep working. I want to be free. I want to go clubbing with my girlfriends if I want to, even though I'm married or in a relationship, and a lot of guys here do not want that.\u201d",
      "International fans are often looking for an alternative world because of disappointment with their own society, Prof Chung says.",
      "The prim romances, with handsome, caring and chivalrous heroes, are drawing a female audience turning away from what they see as hypersexual American entertainment. And when social inequality became a stronger theme in Korean films and shows - such as Parasite and Squid Game \u2013 it attracted global viewers disillusioned with capitalism and a yawning wealth divide in their countries.",
      "The pursuit of a global audience has brought challenges as well. The increasing use of English lyrics in K-pop has led to some criticism.",
      "And there is now a bigger spotlight on the industry's less glamorous side. The immense pressure stars face to be perfect, for instance, and the demands of a hyper-competitive industry. Creators behind blockbuster shows have alleged exploitation and complained about not being fairly compensated.",
      "Still, it\u2019s great to see the world pay attention to Korea, Prof Chung says. She grew up in a repressive South Korea, when critics of the government were regularly threatened or even killed. She escaped into American movies.",
      "When Parasite played in the cinema of the small American town where she lives, she saw on the faces of other moviegoers the same awe she felt as a child watching Hollywood films: \u201cIt feels so great that our love is returned.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 00:11:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Dynamic pricing, Katy Perry's comeback album, Joker 2 and Eurovision were among the biggest fails of 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Money, success, power, beauty - it often seems as if celebrities have everything they could possibly want.",
      "So it's just as well they also get tangled up in their fair share of mishaps, blunders and own goals every year.",
      "Here's a light-hearted look at some of 2024's biggest flops and fails.",
      "1. Katy Perry's comeback",
      "It was supposed to be a triumphant return, but critics and fans complained Katy Perry's latest album 143 sounded dated and showed little artistic growth.",
      "The music video for Woman's World, which saw Perry join a group of dancers wearing tiny outfits on a construction site, was criticised for being regressive, although Perry later said it was supposed to be satirical.",
      "Matters were only made worse when the singer attracted the attention of the Spanish government for shooting the video for follow-up single Lifetimes in ecologically-sensitive sand dunes in the Balearic Islands.",
      "But many fans defended the album, which wasn't as bad as some reviews made out, and Perry's accompanying tour has been a huge success.",
      "2. Joker bombing at the box office",
      "Making a sequel to 2019's Joker, which grossed more than $1bn (\u00a3790m), was something Hollywood found simply irresistible.",
      "Unfortunately, the resulting film, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, was something audiences found entirely resistible.",
      "Making the film a musical was a bold swing, but the tonal handbrake turn alienated the fans and critics who adored the Oscar-winning original.",
      "Folie \u00e0 Deux managed to scrape over the $200m (\u00a3158m) mark, but that was barely enough to cover its production budget, let alone marketing costs.",
      "It wasn't the only movie flop of the year - audiences were also unenthusiastic about Madame Web, The Fall Guy, Kraven the Hunter, Megalopolis, Borderlands, Argylle, Unstoppable and Furiosa: A Mad Max Story.",
      "3. Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing",
      "Ticketmaster attracted a storm of controversy after making use of so-called \"dynamic pricing\" for UK dates on the Oasis reunion tour, which raised the cost of a ticket by \u00a3200 due to the predictable demand.",
      "Charging fans \u00a3350 per ticket was a dubious PR move for a band famous for their working class roots, and the Gallagher brothers wisely distanced themselves from the strategy.",
      "But Ticketmaster argued prices are set by artists and promoters. Dynamic pricing was later ditched for the band's US tour dates.",
      "Meanwhile, 50,000 fans who'd paid inflated prices on secondary platforms in order to secure tickets faced having them cancelled. A total omnishambles for everyone involved.",
      "4. The ruined surprise party",
      "When BBC weather presenter Kawser Quamer was asked in February about her plans for the weekend, she cheerfully explained she was attending her niece's surprise birthday party.",
      "Host Annabel Tiffin said that all sounded very lovely, but presumably the party was no longer a surprise, having just been announced on live TV. \"Oh goodness me,\" replied an alarmed Quamer, \"I've spoiled the surprise!\"",
      "The glorious mishap made its way across the Atlantic, going viral and featuring on Jimmy Kimmel Live.",
      "But Quamer handled it beautifully, and even managed to convince her niece she was talking about a different relative, keeping the surprise element intact.",
      "5. Kaos",
      "Chaos is a term which could be applied to a lot of entries in this list, but one of the biggest casualties of the year was Kaos itself.",
      "Just a month after the first series of Jeff Goldblum's Greek mythology drama was released, Netflix announced it would not return for a second.",
      "Streamers can tell quickly if something is a hit or not by measuring viewing figures and completion rates. Their data even gives them the prospective ratings of the following months based on the first.",
      "But although fans campaigned for its return, ultimately Kaos was Kancelled.",
      "6. The Co-op Live Arena",
      "Manchester's hottest new live venue finally opened this year, but only after several attempts. There was a string of cancellations due to various technical problems, including a ventilation unit falling from the ceiling.",
      "Shows by Peter Kay, Olivia Rodrigo, Take That and others were cancelled or moved, before the venue finally opened with a successful concert from rock band Elbow.",
      "The problems did at least bring one delightful moment: A Radio 4 newsreader announcing the delay of a gig by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.",
      "7. Joe Biden's debate performance",
      "Flops don't come much bigger than a debate performance which was so poor, it brought down an entire presidential campaign.",
      "Joe Biden seemed distant and frail when he took part in a televised live debate in June, struggling to finish some of his sentences and keep pace with Donald Trump.",
      "Biden tried to stay in the race, but the pressure on him became too high as figures including Democrat fundraiser George Clooney publicly called for him to stand down, leading to Kamala Harris replacing him as the candidate.",
      "8. The Olympics opening ceremony",
      "A barnstorming performance from Celine Dion sadly wasn't enough to rescue this soggy croissant of an opening ceremony, which was badly hampered by rain.",
      "Organisers took the event outside of the traditional stadium setting and had performers spread out across Paris instead, which was both a security nightmare and challenging for spectators.",
      "The spread meant things felt somewhat disjointed and it was hard for the ceremony to build any momentum.",
      "Meanwhile, some viewers were upset by a scene involving drag queens which many interpreted as a reference to the Last Supper, but artistic director Thomas Jolly said was a reference to pagan gods.",
      "9. The unofficial Bridgerton ball",
      "Hot on the heels of the disastrous Willy Wonka experience was an unofficial Bridgerton ball, where fans of the Netflix series were invited to dress up and \"step into the enchanting world of the Regency era\".",
      "Unfortunately, they were greeted with disappointing food and drab decor, with one violinist and a pole dancer for entertainment. Creators blamed \"organisational challenges\" and said they \"sincerely apologised\".",
      "We anticipate the event being eviscerated in Lady Whistledown's next newsletter.",
      "10. Eurovision. The whole thing.",
      "This year's Eurovision Song Contest was, frankly, a disaster from start to finish.",
      "A row about Israel's participation prompted security concerns, put all the entrants in an awkward position and even led to the head of Eurovision being booed during the grand final.",
      "Dutch singer Joost Klein was disqualified at the last minute due to a backstage incident involving a female camera operator who accused him of \"threatening\" behaviour. The Swedish prosecution authority said it could not prove that Klein \"had any such intention\".",
      "Winner Nemo even accidentally broke the Eurovision trophy after placing it on stage, leaving the Swiss entrant with bandages after sustaining deep cuts to the thumb.",
      "Host city Malmo said they would refuse to stage the event again if Sweden won, saying they wouldn't have the \"strength and stamina\".",
      "And to top it all off, the UK languished in 18th place.",
      "11. Broadcasting blunders",
      "Laura Kuenssberg withdrew from an interview with Boris Johnson in October after mistakenly sending her briefing notes to the former prime minister himself, resulting in what she called a few \"red faces\".",
      "ITV took over and Johnson later told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley his originally scheduled interview had \"blown up on the launch pad\".",
      "Elsewhere, thousands of viewers complained to Ofcom in August when Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was interviewed on Good Morning Britain by her own husband, Ed Balls, about the violent unrest in parts of the UK.",
      "ITV's chief executive later noted it was a fluid news morning and the team had short notice that Cooper was coming on. She said the interview was impartial and fair but it wouldn't happen again.",
      "Another daytime presenter, Lorraine Kelly, became the subject of a viral X account which monitored her show attendance throughout the year (hovering just below 60%, if you're interested).",
      "Over on Strictly Come Dancing, which had already had a fairly appalling year before this series even started, fans were puzzled by some unusual on-screen encounters between singer Wynne Evans and his partner Katya Jones.",
      "Viewers spotted Jones apparently refusing to high-five Evans, and later moving his hand away from her waist.",
      "The show's welfare team checked in on them after concerns were raised, but the pair apologised for what they said was actually just a \"very silly inside joke\" between them.",
      "12. The Oppenheimer stage invasion",
      "When Oppenheimer was named best film at February's Baftas, the prize was collected by actor Cillian Murphy, director Christopher Nolan, producer Emma Thomas... and a random man standing silently in the background.",
      "The intruder was actually YouTuber Lizwani, who managed to infiltrate the event and make it all the way to the stage during the night's biggest moment.",
      "But the fact he was standing quietly and respectfully meant few viewers even noticed anything was wrong. Bafta have since tightened security.",
      "A month later, there was more awkwardness when Oppenheimer was named best picture at the Oscars, in an announcement fumbled by Al Pacino.",
      "Pacino dispensed with the traditional \"And the Oscar goes to...\"",
      "Instead, he stumbled through proceedings before announcing somewhat abruptly: \"My eyes see Oppenheimer.\"",
      "There was a delayed reaction from the audience and orchestra, who weren't entirely sure if Pacino was finished or if they had heard the winner correctly.",
      "But Scarface redeemed himself later in the year by revealing his delightful Shrek phone cover, courtesy of his young daughter. All was forgiven.",
      "13. Cynthia Erivo's poster reaction",
      "When one fan affectionately edited a promotional poster for Wicked to resemble the musical's original Broadway illustration, actress Cynthia Erivo said it erased her contribution to the film, because her eyes were hidden under her witch's hat.",
      "A barrage of memes followed as fans lightly poked fun at her reaction, with many social media users jokingly trying to avoid any further erasure by attaching pictures of Erivo to posts which had nothing to do with her.",
      "The original fan clarified that the altered film promo was intended to be \"an innocent fan edit to pay homage to the original Broadway poster\".",
      "But Erivo handled the backlash like a pro, making light of the situation and telling ET: \u201cFor me it was just like a human moment of wanting to protect little Elphaba. I probably should have called my friends.\"",
      "14. Rishi in the rain",
      "When Rishi Sunak called a general election in May, the then-prime minister made the announcement outdoors despite it bucketing with rain.",
      "Being in the open air also allowed an anti-Tory activist to disrupt the announcement by blasting music from a nearby speaker.",
      "But Sunak gamely stuck it out, later commenting that he was \"not a fair-weather politician\" and confirming he'd be taking an umbrella on the campaign trail.",
      "15. Tour troubles",
      "Live tours and concerts were disrupted this year for all kinds of reasons.",
      "Jennifer Lopez cancelled her live shows after reports of poor ticket sales, although she said it was so she could spend time with family and friends.",
      "Tenacious D's tour fell apart after one member made some ill-advised comments about Donald Trump.",
      "And Madonna's fans became increasingly frustrated with her lateness.",
      "Elsewhere, Adele repeatedly swore at an audience member in Las Vegas who she thought had shouted \"Pride sucks\". It transpired the fan had actually shouted \"work sucks\" after the singer discussed her working week. Oops.",
      "So fair play to Kate Nash for not only keeping her show on the road, but funding her tour by selling pictures of her bottom online, helpfully bringing publicity to the issues of high tour costs and poor streaming royalties in the process.",

    "story": [
      "Coronation Street's longstanding, long-suffering character Gail said farewell to Weatherfield on Christmas Day, after 50 years on the cobbles.",
      "Actress Helen Worth has stuck with the character through thick and thin since 1974, and fans have seen Gail weather many domestic dramas, romances, bust-ups and even prison.",
      "The ITV soap announced in June that she would depart with \"a major storyline for the Platt family\", and her exit was a typically eventful affair.",
      "The 73-year-old actress has said she felt \"truly blessed\" about her long Corrie career.",
      "Here's a look back at seven of the much-loved character's most memorable moments.",
      "**Spoiler alert** This article contains details of the Christmas episodes",
      "1. Marrying Brian, not once but twice",
      "In her penultimate episode on Tuesday, Gail was seen looking troubled on the eve of her seventh wedding - this time to Jesse Chadwick, with whom she is set to move to France.",
      "And on Christmas Day, she equalled the record as the Street's most married character, alongside Street Cars stud Steve McDonald.",
      "Viewers might recall that in 1979, Gail Potter (bonus points if you remembered her maiden name) married Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten) for the first time.",
      "Brian divorced her following her affair with Ian Latimer because he wasn't sure whether he was really the father of their daughter, Sarah.",
      "The couple reuntied and remarried in 1988, but it didn't end happily. Brian died after being stabbed in an alley after a night out.",
      "2. Coming to terms with teenage pregnancy",
      "In 2000, Gail was shocked to receive the news that Sarah (Tina O'Brien) was pregnant at the age of 13.",
      "She'd taken the teenager to the doctor simply for being sick and not eating, before the baby bombshell was dropped.",
      "\"You can't be pregnant if you've not had sex,\" declared Gail to her tearful daughter.",
      "Shock slowly spread across Gail's face as the reality dawned on her.",
      "Recalling how she felt at the time as a young actress, O'Brien this week told BBC News that Worth \"literally held my hand throughout\" the experence.",
      "\"We were expected to do press [interviews] and I was quite a young girl and quite self-conscious and shy, and she was just so kind and wonderful with me.\"",
      "It turned out all right in the end, with Sarah's on-screen daughter Bethany being all grown up herself now (played  by Lucy Fallon) and still on the show.",
      "3. Her husband, the serial killer",
      "After suffering several heartbreaks - due to the murder of her first husband and then the infidelities of second spouse Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) - Gail appeared to have found happiness in 2002 when she married Richard Hillman (Brian Capron).",
      "But to her horror, it transpired her new beau had murdered not only his ex-wife but also Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw), as well as attempting to kill Gail's own mum Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and neighbour Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire).",
      "Gail, with a now legendary line, branded Richard as \"Norman Bates with a briefcase\", a reference to the serial killer in classic Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho.",
      "She then ended the marriage, which led to Richard kidnapping her, her son David, Sarah and Bethany with the intention of killing them all.",
      "An audience of more than 19 million watched the story reach its climax as he drove her and her family into a canal... killing only himself.",
      "Christmas Eve's episode ended with Gail receiving a visit from a certain ghost of Christmas past.",
      "4. That fight with Eileen Grimshaw",
      "In 2004, angry at how Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) was treating her daughter Sarah, Gail found herself embroiled in a fight with his mother Eileen (Sue Cleaver) that spilled out on to the street.",
      "Having yelled at both Todd and Eileen, Gail goaded the latter into slapping her, before all (hair-pulling) hell broke loose.",
      "When Eileen's other son Jason (Ryan Thomas) arrived on the scene from work, still wearing a hard hat, Gail declared: \"Here they are, the rest of the Village People!\"",
      "As the decades rolled on, the feud continued - but for a respectful ceasefire - with each woman aiming digs at the other about their respective love lives.",
      "It exploded again properly in 2015 when the pair argued over the affections of Gail's fifth husband Michael (Les Dennis).",
      "Cleaver confirmed to the BBC that they had \"never pulled each other's hair\" or \"punched or slapped each other\" in real life, and had in fact been good friends for many years.",
      "\"I think there's going to be a huge hole left by Helen leaving,\" she said. \"We've finished filming and you can feel her absence.",
      "\"You're just so used to seeing her, that twinkly-eyed little lady who's just a ball of joy, she's going to be hugely missed.",
      "\"I mean, that character - she's such an icon. She's one of the last greats.\"",
      "Eileen was not the only Weatherfield woman to be on the receiving end of Gail's anger when defending her family.",
      "In 2010, the tempestous but loyal Gail had an aggresive food fight with Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) after Deirdre was found to have kissed the partner of Gail's mum, Audrey.",
      "\"Ken, do something!\" exclaimed a cake-splattered Deidre.",
      "5. Falsely imprisoned for murder",
      "In 2010, Gail got married again, this time to Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale).",
      "This one wasn't any happier in the end, though, as he decided he was going to fake his own death due to debts.",
      "But he accidentally drowned for real on a boat trip, leading to his new wife being arrested for murder after witnesses said they'd seen the couple arguing (about his aforementioned plan).",
      "In prison, troublemaker Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) lied that her cellmate Gail had confessed to killing Joe.",
      "Luckily for one of the street's most downtrodden characters, Gail was found not guilty and released.",
      "6. Helping her son deal with his wife's death",
      "Gail had her troubles with son David (Jack P. Shepherd) as well, once accusing him of delibrately causing \"fear and misery to everyone in this family\".",
      "\"We've had sleepless nights,\" she added dramatically. \"I'm on pills, for God's sake!\"",
      "By 2016, David was a married man himself. However, that came to a tragic end when his wife Kylie (Paula Lane) was stabbed to death, dying in David's arms.",
      "Gail's motherly advice was for him to be honest with his own children about what had happened.",
      "In a heart-rending, tear-filled scene, she recalled the day she had struggled to tell her eldest son Nick (nowadays Ben Price) the truth about his dad Brian being killed, explaining that the boy had been left scarred.",
      "\"It was just about the worst conversation of my life,\" Gail told David, with a wry laugh to break the tension. \"And it's had some competition.\"",
      "Price told the BBC that while his on-screen mum's big storylines \"were great\", he would miss the \"beautiful bits in between\" with her the most.",
      "\"For me, it's being welcomed into the Platts' [house] in the morning, or having a cup of tea, or going, 'Don't worry mum'.",
      "\"Those moments, for me, were Corrie and were gold.",
      "\"They make me smile.\"",
      "7. Gail's moving monologue",
      "In 2018, Gail powerfully expressed the shock and grief of Weatherfield residents following the devastating suicide of factory boss Aidan Connor.",
      "In an emotional monologue, she reflected on the fact you don't really know what's going on in each other's lives, as footage switched between different characters being told the news.",
      "It was originally meant to be a silent sequence, but writer Jonathan Harvey told BBC News: \"It felt like it needed the gravitas of one of our longest-running characters to pass comment on the community that, when the programme started, was close-knit, looked out for each other and knew everybody's business. That's the cliche of what soaps are.",

    "summary": "The Olympic medallist had a miscarriage and an ectopic pregnancy. Did sport affect her ability to conceive?",
    "story": [
      "Olympic gold-medallist Dame Laura Kenny is Britain's most successful female athlete. She has two young boys but also had a miscarriage and an ectopic pregnancy, and has always wondered if the physical toll of elite sport had damaged her fertility. The BBC News Health team has investigated.",
      "Dame Laura, 32, gave her body to cycling for more than a decade.",
      "\"Every training session I went in there to give 100%, every race I went in there to give 100%.",
      "\"I took it to the limit - if I wasn't sick after a race I'd be like, 'Did I try hard enough?'\"",
      "That absolute commitment was rewarded in the velodrome. Two golds at the London 2012 Olympics were followed by two more at Rio 2016.",
      "She married fellow cycling phenomenon Jason Kenny later that year and the couple welcomed their first baby, Albie, in 2017. She then secured another gold and silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021).",
      "But she miscarried in November 2021 and five months later had an ectopic pregnancy, in which the embryo implants outside of the womb, requiring emergency surgery.",
      "\"Everything was a shock - I went from being so in control of my body to being so out of control,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "Dame Laura had never really worried about her own fertility before. Conceiving Albie had been straightforward, and that pregnancy went smoothly.",
      "But since first talking publicly about her baby losses, other athletes have told her they have been through the same thing.",
      "It's left a nagging question \u2013 could elite sport have a damaging impact on the fertility of female athletes?",
      "\"Was my body just running on empty, and then it said, 'Well, hang on, there's no way we can do this?'\" she says.",
      "Miscarriage is common. About one in four pregnancies ends before 24 weeks and many occur at a very early stage. Most couples never find out why.",
      "But are athletes at greater risk of any type of fertility problem?",
      "Dr Emma O'Donnell, an exercise physiologist at Loughborough University, says the lifestyle of a professional athlete puts a unique strain on the human body.",
      "Elite training burns a phenomenal number of calories and, as a result, athletes' bodies are often lean and muscular, containing very little body fat.",
      "If they don't eat enough food to keep up with the calorie burn then issues with menstrual cycles, such as periods stopping for months or even years, are \"very common\", Dr O'Donnell says.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of female athletes experience interrupted periods, particularly in endurance sports. There are comparably high rates of periods disappearing in competitors in sports like gymnastics, ballet and figure skating. This compares to only 2-5% of the general population.",
      "Absent periods can be a sign that ovulation (or egg release) isn't happening.",
      "How does that happen in the body?",
      "\"We're not 100% sure,\" says Dr O'Donnell, but the leading idea is that having a baby is so energy-intensive that the brain shuts off reproduction if it thinks there is insufficient spare energy.",
      "It starts in the hypothalamus, a small structure in the centre of the brain that senses the nutritional state of the body.",
      "Sitting just underneath the hypothalamus is the body's hormone factory - the pituitary gland.",
      "Normally, the gland releases hormones that travel down to the womb and ovaries to control the monthly menstrual cycle and the release of an egg, which makes pregnancy possible.",
      "But if the hypothalamus isn't happy, this process breaks down and ovulation doesn't happen.",
      "\"If you're not ovulating you can't have a baby. You can't conceive because there's no egg being released,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "The biggest factor in this seems to be the huge number of calories burned while training, which can leave athletes struggling to eat enough food to compensate.",
      "This phenomenon is known as relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S), and was first recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 2014.",
      "But other factors are also likely to be involved, says Prof Geeta Nargund, a consultant at St George's Hospital and medical director of Create Fertility.",
      "Fat in the body helps make the sex hormone oestrogen.",
      "\"If the sport is affecting body fat content, then quite clearly there's an effect on oestrogen levels,\" she says.",
      "Psychological stress \u2013 potentially from the pressures of training and competing \u2013 can also disrupt the menstrual cycle.",
      "\"We do see this in women with high levels of anxiety,\" said Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Disruption to periods and egg release is the most clearly recognised impact on a female athlete's fertility, but this should resolve once they retire from competition, she notes.",
      "Ectopic and miscarriage",
      "For those who do manage to conceive, things can still go wrong. After an egg is fertilised, it should implant into the lining of the womb. However, in an ectopic pregnancy the egg implants elsewhere, usually in the fallopian tubes that connect the ovaries to the womb.",
      "Around 11,000 pregnancies a year in the UK are ectopic. It's not completely clear why they happen, although inflammation and scar tissue in the fallopian tubes can increase the risk.",
      "\"But in this case, I don't see a direct link between sports and an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancy,\" said Prof Nargund, who has treated athletes struggling with their fertility.",
      "However, she said there was a potential link between too much intense exercise in the first three months of pregnancy and miscarriage \u2013 although far more research is needed to be certain.",
      "She pointed to a large Danish study that followed more than 90,000 women and suggested the more intense exercise women did, the higher the risk. This was particularly for weight-bearing and high-impact exercises.",
      "\"If you end up in the Laura Kenny territory where you're an elite athlete, you're the very top of that,\" Prof Nargund said.",
      "But she explained the findings needed to be taken \"with caution\" because the way the study was designed meant there could be other explanations that had not been considered.",
      "Meanwhile, a very small study of 34 Norwegian athletes found no increased risk of fertility problems, including miscarriage.",
      "\"We need to do a lot more research when it comes to sports, exercise, hormone balance and reproduction,\" says Prof Nargund.",
      "Athletes freezing their eggs",
      "Lauren Nicholls played elite level netball for 10 years then had two children, before becoming coach of Super League champions Loughborough Lightning. She says the conversations current players have about fertility are different to the ones she had with her teammates.",
      "\"I know a few of the slightly older players - they've frozen eggs and made those decisions for their family for a later date,\" she says. \"Because they're worried about their career.\"",
      "Juggling being an elite athlete and starting a family has always been a tricky challenge. For women, their years of peak fertility overlap with the time they hit their physical peak.",
      "Male athletes are also not immune to fertility issues. Burning more energy than you have coming in may affect testosterone levels, cause sperm abnormalities and even erectile dysfunction.",
      "But for Dr Emma Pullen, a sports exercise researcher at Loughborough, the lack of definitive answers on the impact of elite sport is emblematic of how poorly female athletes have been researched, from fertility to injury risk.",
      "She said research was \"playing catch up\" with the amount of attention on male sport.",
      "\"We're seeing the repercussions of that with growing professionalisation of women's sports and more female athletes than ever before,\" Dr Pullen adds.",
      "Overall, Prof Nargund argues female athletes are likely to face more fertility challenges than other women.",
      "\"There seems to be a fertility problem because of [elite sport's] potential effect on ovulation, including potentially a higher risk of miscarriage,\" she says.",
      "But a definitive answer on exactly how much elite-level exercise is too much is not clear. And that's enough for Dame Laura, for now.",
      "\"The conversation in itself I feel is really important because I want people to start talking,\" Laura says. \"Honestly, I would love it if it was a lot more open.\"",
      "The relationship between exercise and fertility affects all of us though, even if we're a long way from Olympic glory.",
      "How does exercise affect everyone else's fertility?",
      "Most men and women benefit from exercising and losing excess weight before trying to conceive \u2013 this is known to boost fertility.",
      "Regular physical activity reduces stress, improves sleep and makes periods more regular in those with the hormonal condition polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).",
      "But amateur female athletes who train intensively can also end up running on empty and seeing their periods stop, or become irregular.",
      "\"Not to quite the same extent, but it's there,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Making sure there's a balance between energy intake and energy output is \"really important to ovulatory cycles\" and the key to maintaining reproductive function, she adds.",
      "\"[Amateur athletes] are not aware of the fact of how many calories they really need to put in to meet that energy demand.\""

      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",

      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",

      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",
      "'We decided to split the boys up'",
      "Unfortunately at the time Tommy was a huge trigger for him because he was loud and unpredictable. His self-harming would scare Tommy so we used to have to keep them apart a lot.",
      "In 2016, my wife Charlotte and I sadly decided to separate. We took the incredibly difficult decision to split Jude and Tommy up and we felt guilty, like we were failing.",

      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",
      "Their school is helping them to do more fun things together like trampolining and eating lunch together.",
      "'I've just had one of my best ever days with them'",

      "There have been times he's been too anxious to do that and we were housebound but at the moment he's doing OK.",
      "Tommy is 13, and he is cheeky, mischievous, funny, and curious about everything around him. He loves looking at books and puzzles. He isn't fully verbal but he uses a communication device.",
      "I recently had one of the best days I've ever had with Jude and Tommy.",
      "In the past, when we have tried to do anything to celebrate Christmas, it has never gone well, it was too overwhelming for them. But we went to see Father Christmas and made such special memories.",

      "Nine years ago I began sharing stories from our lives online, on a weekly blog. Then I started Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok accounts.",

      "I could never find the words to explain, and I wanted to show how proud I was of them, so I started writing instead.",
      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",

      "Jude and Tommy will need life-long support, and I've started to realise I might not always be able to provide that for them.",
      "I don't know what the future will look like, but I know I need to think about how to help them live as independently as they can, and prepare for the days when I'm not here.",
      "Autism has meant we've had some of the highest highs, and experienced some lows far lower than I ever knew were imaginable.",

    "summary": "Newly-released files show ministers had concerns about more workers coming to the UK when the EU expanded.",
    "story": [
      "Senior ministers urged the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to delay granting employment rights to eastern and central European workers when the EU expanded in 2004, newly released files have revealed.",
      "In February that year, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw pointed out that Britain was alone amongst the bigger EU members in offering a \"concession\".",
      "The concession meant people from Poland and other newly joined EU countries would be able to work in Britain after 1 May.",
      "Almost all the other large states would not allow this for two years: only Italy was undecided. Smaller EU countries, aside from Ireland, had work permit schemes which would limit numbers.",
      "Papers from the National Archives - which have been released now they are 20 years old - show Straw proposed a six-month delay for the UK.",
      "He said: \"I believe we could be faced with a very difficult situation in early May\".",
      "He warned the UK could \"be forced to revoke the concession in the least propitious of circumstances\".",
      "His letter was copied to other senior ministers, and the then-deputy prime minister John Prescott supported Straw.",
      "Prescott wrote that he was \"extremely concerned\" about the potential impact on social housing.",
      "He was also worried that many workers would come to London and the South East, and unable to find decent housing would \"resort to sharing overcrowded housing in poor conditions\".",
      "But David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, argued the economy needed the \"flexibility and productivity\" these new workers could provide.",
      "Eight eastern and central European countries joined the EU in 2004, including Poland. According to the government, the number of Polish nationals living in the UK increased from around 69,000 to around 853,000 over the next decade.",
      "Blair asked whether the UK could have work permits, but instead the Home Office speedily drew up a \"workers registration scheme\".",
      "That scheme required A8 workers - those from the eight new member states - to pay a fee and register their employment in a specific job. Failing to do so would incur a significant fine.",
      "From May 2004 onwards, No 10 monitored these registration numbers week by week.",
      "The government was particularly worried because it had publicly estimated that only 13,000 new workers a year would come to Britain after the EU expanded.",
      "The files show that Kate Gross, one of the private secretaries at No 10, wrote to the prime minister on 2 July 2004.",
      "She enclosed a briefing note for the press which would say \"the influx of new arrivals predicted by the media simply hasn't arrived\", even though that 13,000 had been exceeded.",
      "She explained that while 24,000 people had registered with the scheme, most had been living in the UK before 1 May.",
      "Kate Gross's memo notes that most were young, aged 18-34 - and there was no evidence of them \"exploiting the benefits system\". Blair scrawled \"that is the key\" by the side of that statement.",
      "However Kate Gross noted \"the key elephant trap is how these figures relate to previous HO [Home Office] projections\".",
      "If applications continued to increase, she wrote, the number of new arrivals would hit \"50-60,000 by May 2005\".",
      "The next set of figures for the scheme showed a drop, and a briefing paper to No 10 said: \"It looks like we are over the peak in applications.\"",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Directorate \"should be congratulated on implementing the workers registration scheme in short order\", it said.",
      "The problem was, the scheme wasn't providing an accurate record.",
      "The self-employed did not have to register, for example, which excluded many building workers like carpenters.",
      "And there was little enforcement.",
      "The shortcomings of the workers registration scheme were exposed in late 2005, when according to the WRS there were only 95 Polish plumbers in the whole of the  UK.",
      "In 24 hours the Daily Mail found 95 Polish plumbers in London alone.",
      "Over the next few years hundreds of thousands of A8 nationals, mostly Polish, moved to the UK.",

      "They contacted watchdogs, including energy regulator Ofgem and water regulator Ofwat, before Christmas asking them to submit proposals by mid-January.",
      "This comes after figures published earlier this week indicated the UK economy had flatlined between July and September.",

      "UK economy had zero growth between July and September",
      "Get serious on pay in 2025, TUC chief tells ministers",
      "The letter - which is also understood to have been sent to the Environment Agency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and healthcare regulators - was first reported by Sky News.",
      "Signed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, it said ministers believed collaboration to be essential to ensure the regulatory environment became \"more pro-growth and pro-investment\" while respecting the independence of regulators.",
      "The FCA said it would reply in the new year. It added that it had already delivered measures since the summer to support growth, including reforming information that retail investors receive, as well as making proposals to provide better value for money for workplace pensions.",
      "The letter said improving regulation to enable growth and not hold back investment was \"an essential part\" of the government's growth mission.",
      "Economic growth is a principal reason behind many major policy announcements, from Communities Secretary Angela Rayner unveiling reforms to the planning system in order to boost house-building, to the chancellor encouraging more \"sensible risk-taking\" in financial services companies.",

      "It is also an indication that the prime minister fears regulators can restrain economic growth by imposing obstacles to business activity \u2013 a message typically more associated with Conservative politicians but which Starmer is increasingly putting at the heart of his plans.",

      "And in October, addressing a summit of international investors in London, he said: \"We've got to look at regulation across the piece, and where it is needlessly holding back investment\u2026 mark my words, we will get rid of it\".",
      "On the other side of the argument will be groups in various sectors where there is a regulator, who argue that what the government sees as obstacles are in fact necessary rules.",
      "Conservative MP Griffith said that if the prime minister wants the UK to exhibit the fastest growth in the G7, then \"he'd have more luck turning the clock back to before the general election when the UK was growing under the Conservatives\".",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Keir warned MPs it would take some time for people to feel their living standards improve.",
      "This week Reeves also said the challenge was to fix the economy \"after 15 years of neglect is huge\", while shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the figures showed \"growth has tanked on Labour's watch\"."

    "story": [
      "On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including how it affects space weather at Earth.",
      "This was a landmark moment for humanity \u2013 but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all.",
      "Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby, the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C.",
      "But the success of these autonomous spacecraft \u2013 coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence \u2013 raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration.",
      "Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all.",
      "\"Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,\" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. \"I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space.\"",
      "He also points to the risk to humans.",
      "\"The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,\" he argues.",
      "Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. \"For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,\" he says. \"[They] go much further and do more things.\"",
      "They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. \"And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer.\"",
      "But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts \u2013 and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?",
      "Rovers verses mankind",
      "Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon.",
      "In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket).",
      "\"Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,\" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. \"It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant.\"",
      "But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.",
      "Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces.",
      "\"Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,\" says Dr Weinersmith.",
      "In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: \"A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep\u2026 It wants and asks for nothing.\"",
      "But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical \u2013 for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph.",
      "\"AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?\" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. \"I just don't think we know.\"",
      "He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be \"more efficient\".",
      "AI assistants and humanoid robots",
      "Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research.",
      "\"[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,\" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't.\"",
      "The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. \"We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has\" \u2013 meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM.",
      "Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.",
      "Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities.",
      "Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans.",
      "Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems.",
      "A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.",
      "\"If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,\" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. \"We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.\"",
      "He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.",
      "Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.",
      "\"You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.\"",
      "But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.",
      "\"Inspiration is something that is intangible,\" argues Prof Coates.",
      "Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. \"Humans relate when humans are doing something.",
      "\"The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing.\"",
      "Life on Mars?",
      "Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme.",
      "The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface.",
      "The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon.",
      "Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land.",
      "His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years.",
      "\"Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,\" explains Dr Weinersmith. \"If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary.\"",
      "However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved.",
      "\"Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,\" she says. \"There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to.",
      "\"I think we should be slowing down.\"",
      "Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. \"I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,\" he says.",
      "\"We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars.\"",

      "\"I hit the jackpot,\" he says.",

      "Now a whole new generation of stargazers are scanning the skies again because scientists believe T Cor Bor ignites about every 80 years or so.",
      "On a crystal clear night, in the Dark Skies Reserve of Bannau Brycheiniog, also known as the Brecon Beacons, astronomers are setting up their telescopes.",
      "\"T Cor Bor is dim at the minute  - it's magnitude 10, well below what you can see with the naked eye,\" explains Dr Jenifer Millard from Fifth Star Labs.",
      "To find the area of sky where it should appear, she advises to first locate the plough and follow its handle to Arcturus. To the west of this star is the curved constellation of Corona Borealis, made up of seven stars, and where T Cor Bor will at some point light up.",
      "\"It is only going to be visible to the naked eye for a couple of days,\" she says.",
      "\"Of course, if you've got a small pair of binoculars or a small telescope, you'll be able to see it for a little bit longer because you've got that magnifying tool. But I do think that it is the short stint in the sky that makes it really special.\"",
      "The astronomical phenomenon is caused by the interaction between two stars orbiting each other.",
      "A small white dwarf, which is a dead star, is locked in a cosmic dance with a much larger red giant - a star that's reaching the end of its life.",
      "The compact white dwarf has an immense gravitational pull, so great that it steals material away from its larger neighbour.",
      "\"The gravity on the surface of the white dwarf is a million times the gravity we feel on Earth, so if we stood on it, we would be crushed instantly,\" explains Dr Jane Clark, from the Cardiff Astronomical Society.",
      "Over time, the material it grabs from the other star gets crushed and compressed - until eventually it triggers a nuclear explosion, releasing a huge amount of energy - a process known as going nova.",
      "\"And when that happens, it will shine like the best Christmas tree in town,\" says Dr Clark.",
      "Astronomers think this process happens on repeat, with an outburst from T Cor Bor occurring about every 80 years.",
      "But there aren't many records of this. And there have already been a few false alarms that T Cor Bor was about to appear - followed by a disappointing no show.",
      "But Dr Chris North from Cardiff University says astronomers around the world are poised to catch the light show, which will allow them to study this star in more detail than ever before.",
      "And he's hopeful it could appear soon.",
      "\"It seems that in the past, this has dimmed a little bit before it's actually erupted, and there are signs that maybe, at the moment, it's just dipping a little bit in brightness,\" he says.",

      "\"This close-up study of the Sun allows Parker Solar Probe to take measurements that help scientists better understand how material in this region gets heated to millions of degrees, trace the origin of the solar wind (a continuous flow of material escaping the Sun), and discover how energetic particles are accelerated to near light speed,\" the agency said.",
      "Dr Nicola Fox, head of science at Nasa, previously told BBC News: \"For centuries, people have studied the Sun, but you don't experience the atmosphere of a place until you actually go [and] visit it.",

      "That might not sound that close, but Dr Fox put it into perspective. \"We are 93 million miles away from the Sun, so if I put the Sun and the Earth one metre apart, Parker Solar Probe is 4cm from the Sun - so that's close.\"",
      "The probe endured temperatures of 1,400C and radiation that could have frazzled the on-board electronics.",
      "It was protected by an 11.5cm (4.5in) thick carbon-composite shield, but the spacecraft's tactic was to get in and out fast.",
      "In fact, it moved faster than any human-made object, hurtling at 430,000mph - the equivalent of flying from London to New York in less than 30 seconds.",
      "Parker's speed came from the immense gravitational pull it felt as it fell towards the Sun.",
      "So why go to all this effort to \"touch\" the Sun?",

      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",
      "The South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a  strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.",
      "According to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.",
      "With international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:05:18 GMT",
    "summary": "A row has erupted over a long-standing US visa programme, We looked into the figures behind the scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Some immigration hardliners say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",

      "He says a big hit - especially one with the cultural resonance of GTA - can get more people \"in the mood to buy video games\" and publishers want to capitalise on that.",
      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",

      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",

Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",

      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",
      "The ramifications, whichever way it goes, will no doubt be far-reaching.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 01:44:28 GMT",
    "summary": "How a very popular puzzle that was first invented 50 years ago may have certain wellbeing benefits",
    "story": [
      "On a cold day in November, hundreds of people flocked to an arena in Coventry, which has previously hosted gigs by Oasis, Rihanna, and Harry Styles, for an event of a very different kind.",
      "The 500 people who turned out - some from as far afield as Mongolia and Canada - were taking part in an activity less known for drawing in crowds: the Rubik's UK Championship in \"speedcubing,\" or racing to solve puzzle cubes at terrific speed.",
      "Rows of tables were laid out in the arena and 15 events took place over three days. Some involved solving the puzzle one-handed, others while blindfolded. Teenager James Alonso won the tournament's biggest event - solving the classic 3x3 cube at speed with an average of 6.3 seconds.",
      "Speedcubing has been popular since the 1980s and the world record for a single solve in that event is currently held by Max Park from the US, with a time of just 3.13 seconds. It is a far cry from the initial speed of Ern\u0151 Rubik, an architecture professor, who invented the Rubik's Cube in 1974 and took around a month to solve it.",
      "Flash forward to today and an estimated 412,000 people have taken part in speedcubing competitions worldwide. The popularity has increased too, with reported global sales of Rubik's Cube products recorded as $86.6m (\u00a367m) in 2023, up 13.5% on 2022. (The brand was acquired by a Canadian multinational toy company Spin Master in 2021.)",
      "That's not counting the sales of other types of puzzle cubes by different brands. Some are wooden, others electronic with built-in bluetooth, then there are those with all manner of colourful designs.",
      "But now, scientists have lauded speedcubing, in particular, as not only a popular hobby but one that could have wellbeing benefits too.",
      "\"Speedcubing offers a unique combination of cognitive challenge, [alongside] social connection, and personal achievement that contributes to happiness\", says Polina Beloborodova, research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Centre for Healthy Minds.",
      "And this is said to run far deeper than a simple momentary rush.",
      "Cubing and happiness: what experts say",
      "\"Speedcubing satisfies the basic psychological need for competence, the feeling of effectiveness and mastery,\" explains Dr Beloborodova. It involves a number of factors including, problem-solving, memory, spatial reasoning and motor coordination.",
      "But solving the cube may also elicit happiness because it taps into other emotions, according to Dr Julia Christensen, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Germany. \"Awe, beauty, being moved, all these are aesthetic emotions, and experiencing them gives us an extreme sense of happiness,\" she says.",
      "\"For example, when a pattern is the right pattern, when a move is particularly amazing on the cube, these aesthetic emotions can give transformative experiences.\"",
      "Some speedcubers have described the state of mind that the activity can bring as a sense of \"flow\".",
      "\"This state is achieved when the activity's difficulty matches your skill level, distractions are minimal, the goals are clear, and feedback is immediate \u2014 all of which are characteristics of speedcubing,\" says Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Flow can feel \"almost meditative\", according to Ian Scheffler, author of Cracking the Cube, who has experienced this first-hand. \"You enter this state where you are kind of thinking and not thinking at the same time - you are reacting to what the cube is giving you, but in almost an instinctual way.",
      "\"It's a kind of mindfulness that's deeply rewarding\u2026 a peaceful, calm state where you're completely in tune with every twist of the puzzle.\"",
      "There is good reason to seek a flow state regularly, according to Dr Christensen. \"Science shows that people who regularly experience flow have a better mental health, possibly better physical health, and are more in tune.",
      "\"When we repeat movements they become logged or encoded from explicit, effort-full memory systems, and pass into implicit, less effort-full, and procedural memory systems,\" she continues.",
      "Nicholas Archer, a 17-year-old speedcuber from West Yorkshire, who won the one-handed competition in this year's UK Championship with an average time of 8.69 seconds, says that he has experienced this. \"When I'm solving the cube, I'm certainly not having to think too much about what I'm doing. It's all automatic.\"",
      "Speedcubing social benefits",
      "\"Speedcubing or solving a cube on your own may increase your happiness,\" says Dr Adil Khan, a reader in neuroscience at King's College London (KCL) - but when combined with the social aspect, any benefits may be greater.",
      "\"Since speedcubing is a social phenomenon, perhaps the social aspect combines with the puzzle solving to deliver a deeply satisfying experience.\"",
      "Jan Hammer started speedcubing at the age of 44, after being introduced to it by his 13-year-old daughter. He has since solved the cube around 10,000 times but does not think he would have maintained this level of enthusiasm had he been speedcubing alone.",
      "\"The fact that I can do this with my daughter and that we cheer for each other is wonderful. Additionally, being part of the cube community has become a huge motivation.\"",
      "Competitions tend to have more children and teenagers - it is not uncommon for competitors to be as young as six. The activity is also significantly more popular with males. The World Cube Association reports that 221,117 men have competed at their events, compared with 24,311 women.",
      "Regardless of demographic, \"for those who view speedcubing as a significant part of their life - such as participants in tournaments - it can offer eudemonic happiness, fostering a sense of purpose and meaning through dedication, accomplishment, and community of like-minded people,\" argues Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Psychologists differentiate between two aspects of happiness: \"hedonic wellbeing,\" related to emotional experiences, and \"eudemonic wellbeing,\" which concerns meaning and purpose in life.",
      "\"Both are essential for overall happiness and speedcubing can contribute to both types of wellbeing,\" she says. All of this \"contributes to better mental health\".",
      "Puzzles and the brain: the science",
      "The effects of speedcubing on the brain and cognitive function are, however, less clear.",
      "While solving a cube, the brain is trying out different moves, asking \"what might happen if I move the cube in this way?\" explains Dr Toby Wise, senior research fellow in neuroimaging at King's College London.",
      "\"Your brain stores a memory trace for different configurations of the cube, and it can run through different configurations to predict which will have the best outcome.\"",
      "However it doesn't necessarily create long-term benefits, like improvements to memory function. This is because, as Dr Khan explains, the brain is not like a muscle that needs to be flexed to make it grow.",
      "For many years it has been suggested by some that solving puzzles, whether Sudoku or crosswords, can have a hand in slowing cognitive decline or dementia. However this is not necessarily the case.",
      "A study undertaken by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the University of Aberdeen, and published in the BMJ in 2018, found that people who regularly do intellectual activities throughout life have higher mental abilities, providing a \"higher cognitive point\" from which to decline, but that they do not decline any slower.",
      "\"Solving puzzles does not improve your brain power in much other than the puzzle itself,\" argues Dr Khan. \"And almost certainly does not prevent age-related decline in brain power.\"",
      "'The school system is broken': Why more parents are home-educating their children",
      "How the internet normalised extreme porn - and shaped male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "One further benefit of speedcubing, according to regular players, is its sense of escapism from frenzied modern life.",
      "\"Having a clear goal, something that you can actually realise, is something that we don't necessarily have in everyday life, and that appeases our brain,\" says Dr Christensen.",
      "This perhaps explains why the cube is so popular in an age with myriad computer games and technological activities to choose from. As Mr Hammer puts it: \"When I pick up the cube, I become more alert and focused.\"",
      "He uses it in the workplace too. \"It can help me enter the next meeting with a more structured perspective,\" he says.",
      "Mr Scheffler agrees: \"The process of taking the cube from this chaotic, disordered state, which is always different because there's so many permutations of the puzzle, to the same ordered state is fundamentally something that humans want to be doing.",
      "\"There's a fundamental human need to make order out of disorder, because the universe is a very chaotic place, and most things are not ordered.\"",

      "The spokesperson said the hacker was able to remotely access several Treasury user workstations and some unclassified documents that were kept by those users.",
      "The department did not specify the nature of these files, or when and for how long the hack took place. They also did not specify the level of confidentiality of the computer systems or the seniority of the staff whose materials were accessed.",

      "The spokesperson said the Treasury Department \"takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds\", and that it will continue to work on protecting its data from outside threats.",
      "The department letter states that a supplemental report on the incident will be provided to lawmakers in 30 days.",

      "The world was surprised and Beijing was elated, but the island of Taiwan, which had long relied on US support against Chinese claims, was crushed. Carter is still a controversial figure there.",
      "Previously, the US had only recognised the government of Taiwan, which China viewed as a renegade province. And for years US support for Taiwan had been the sticking point in negotiations.",
      "Switching recognition to Beijing meant the US had finally acknowledged China's position that there was only one Chinese government - and it was in Beijing. This is the One China policy, which, to this day, forms the cornerstone of US-China relations.",
      "But the pivot raised inevitable questions about US commitment to its allies. Uneasy with Carter's decision, Congress eventually forced through a law codifying its right to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons, thus creating a lasting contradiction in US foreign policy.",
      "Still historians agree that 1979 signalled an extraordinary set of moves that reoriented global power: not only did it unite the US and China against the Soviet Union, but also paved the way for peace and rapid economic growth in East Asia.",
      "A 'unique' friendship",
      "But Carter could not have done it without his special relationship with Deng Xiaoping. \"It's a pleasure to negotiate with him,\" Carter wrote in his diary after spending a day with Deng during his January visit, according to Deng's biographer Ezra Vogel.",
      "\"The two of them followed common sense, there were actually significant similarities in their no-nonsense personalities,\" said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. \"There was something really unique between the two men that really established trust.\"",
      "Deng Xiaoping had survived three political purges under Mao to emerge as one of China's most consequential leaders. Historians credit his vision, self-assurance, frankness and sharp wit in no small part for this crucial diplomatic win.",
      "He sensed the opportunity Carter offered, Vogel writes - to both thwart Soviet power and to kickstart the modernisation that had begun in Japan, Taiwan and even South Korea. He knew it would elude China without US help.",
      "Deng's visit to the US began with a warm first meeting at the White House, where he chuckled while revealing his Qingdao connection to Carter, according to Chinese reports. He was exuberant as the two clasped hands in front of cameras in the Rose Garden, saying: \"Now our two countries' peoples are shaking hands.\"",
      "Over the next few days, Deng staged a whirlwind charm offensive on the Americans as he toured several states with Carter. In one famous image, Deng is seen grinning as he dons a cowboy hat at a Texan rodeo. \"Deng avoids politics, goes Texan,\" read a local newspaper headline.",
      "Carter described Deng as \"smart, tough, intelligent, frank, courageous, personable, self-assured, friendly\", according to Vogel.",
      "He later wrote in his diary the trip was \"one of the delightful experiences of my Presidency\u2026 to me, everything went right, and the Chinese leader seemed equally pleased.\"",
      "\"Carter was really a catalytic agent for what was more than a diplomatic rapprochement - it was a dramatic moment of signalling,\" said Orville Schell, the director of the Asia Society's Centre on US-China Relations who, as a journalist in 1979, covered Deng's trip.",
      "\"He introduced Deng to the country and actually to the world. It made what had been a contentious relationship to something very congenial. The way Carter and Deng interacted, these were signals that it was okay to both peoples to set history aside and start a new relationship.\"",
      "Under Carter, China was granted \"most favoured nation\" trade status, boosting its economy and creating jobs. Within a year, two-way trade between the two countries doubled.",
      "Throughout the next decade China became an important trade partner not just for the US but also the world, which was \"extraordinarily important\" for China's growth, noted Prof Yang.",
      "A lifelong connection",
      "Carter's connection with China endured long after his presidency ended.",
      "In the 1990s his non-profit group The Carter Center played a significant role in China's nascent grassroots democracy where - on the invitation of the Chinese government - it observed village elections, trained officials and educated voters.",
      "Unusually for a former US president, Carter returned several times to China on personal visits. On one trip, he and his wife Rosalynn helped to build shelters for victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.",
      "His commitment to humanitarian work, his humble background as the son of a peanut farmer, and \"folksy style\" - which stood in contrast to the formal public personas of Chinese leaders - endeared him to many Chinese, according to Prof Yang: \"He will be seen as a role model of a leader who cares, not just in rhetoric but also in actions.\"",
      "\"Everywhere he travelled in China, people showed their warm feelings for him\u2026 The Chinese people really liked him for his courage and his honesty,\" said Dr Liu, a senior adviser with the Carter Center. He accompanied Carter on several trips, including a 2014 tour where he was f\u00eated by local officials and universities.",
      "In Qingdao, the city put on a surprise fireworks show for his 90th birthday. In Beijing, Deng's daughter hosted  a banquet and presented a gift - a copy of the People's Daily front page of the 1979 communique. \"Both were moved to tears,\" Dr Liu recalled.",
      "That was to be his last visit. As the US-China relationship grew rockier, so too did Carter's ties with the Chinese leadership, particularly after Xi Jinping took power.",
      "On the eve of his 2014 visit, top government officials instructed universities not to sponsor his events, prompting a last-minute scramble to change venues, Carter noted.",
      "A state dinner held for him at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing was sparsely attended, recalled Mr Schell. Notably, it was hosted by then vice-president Li Yuanchao, while Xi was said to be entertaining another dignitary elsewhere in the complex.",
      "\"He wouldn't even come to tip his hat to Carter. That really showed the state of relations,\" Mr Schell said. \"Carter was really very angry. Two of his aides told me he even felt like leaving early because he felt disrespected.\"",
      "The Carter Center's activities in China were eventually curtailed, and a website they maintained to document the village elections was taken offline. No clear explanation was given at the time, but Dr Liu attributed this to China's growing suspicion of foreign organisations following the 2010 Arab Spring.",
      "Though Carter said little about the snub publicly, it would have been felt no less acutely, given the lengths he had gone to advocate for engagement.",
      "It has also raised questions whether his approach on human rights with China - he characterised it as \"patience\" but others criticised it as soft-pedalling - was justified in the end.",
      "Carter often \"made a tremendous effort\u2026 not to stick fingers into China's eyes on the human rights question,\" Mr Schell noted. \"He did temper himself even when he was out of office, as The Carter Center had a real stake in the country.\"",
      "Some see his decision to engage with Communist China as born out of an American sincerity at the time. Following the violent chaos of the Cultural Revolution, there was \"a disbelief among many Americans - how could the Chinese be living in angry isolation?\" Prof Yang said. \"There was a genuine desire among American leaders to really help.\"",
      "Others say that in attempting to shore up support against the Soviets, the US set the course for China's rise and ended up creating one of its greatest rivals.",
      "But these actions also benefited millions of Chinese, helping to lift them out of poverty and - for a time - widening political freedom at the local level.",
      "\"I think all of us from that generation were children of engagement,\" Mr Schell said. \"We were hoping Carter would find the formula that would slowly bring China into a comfortable relationship with [the] US and the rest of the world.\"",
      "Toward the end of his life, Carter grew more alarmed about the growing distrust between the US and China, and frequently warned of a possible \"modern Cold War\".",
      "\"In 1979, Deng Xiaoping and I knew we were advancing the cause of peace. While today's leaders face a different world, the cause of peace remains just as important,\" he wrote on the 40th anniversary of normalisation of relations.",
      "\"[Leaders] must accept our conviction that the United States and China need to build their futures together, for themselves and for humanity at large.\"",

    "summary": "An air safety expert says lives could have been saved if the \"obstruction\" was not there.",

      "Footage shows the Jeju Air plane coming off the runway before colliding with the wall and bursting into flames at Muan International Airport.",
      "Authorities investigating the cause of South Korea's worst-ever plane crash are considering the significance of the concrete wall's location about 250m (820ft) off the end of the runway.",
      "Air safety expert David Learmount said that, had the \"obstruction\" not been there, the plane \"would have come to rest with most - possibly all - those on board still alive\".",
      "The pilot reported that the plane had struck a bird and then aborted the original landing and requested permission to land from the opposite direction.",
      "The plane came down some distance along the 2,800m runway and appeared to land without using its wheels or any other landing gear.",
      "Mr Learmount said the landing was \"as good as a flapless/gearless touchdown could be: wings level, nose not too high to avoid breaking the tail\" and the plane had not sustained substantial damage as it slid along the runway.",
      "\"The reason so many people died was not the landing as such, but the fact that the aircraft collided with a very hard obstruction just beyond the runway end,\" he said.",
      "Christian Beckert, a Lufthansa pilot based in Munich, called the concrete structure \"unusual\", telling Reuters news agency: \"Normally, on an airport with a runway at the end, you don't have a wall.\"",
      "The concrete structure holds a navigation system that assists aircraft landings - known as a localiser - according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.",
      "At 4m high, it is covered with dirt and was raised to keep the localiser level with the runway to ensure it functions properly, Yonhap reported.",
      "South Korea's transport ministry has said that other airports in the country and some overseas have the equipment installed with concrete structures. However officials will examine whether it should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Chris Kingswood, a pilot with 48 years' experience who has flown the same type of aircraft involved in the crash, told BBC News: \"Obstacles within a certain range and distance of the runway are required to be frangible, which means that if an aircraft strikes them that they do break.",
      "\"It does seem unusual that it's such a rigid thing. The aircraft, from what I understand, was travelling very fast, landed a long way down the runway, so it will have gone a long way past the end of the runway... so where will you draw the line with that? That's certainly something that will be investigated.",
      "\"Aeroplanes are not strong structures - they are, by design, light to make them efficient in flight. They're not really designed to go high-speed on its belly so any kind of structure could cause the fuselage to break up and then be catastrophic.",

      "She told BBC News: \"We need to know, were (the pilots) aware there was this hard boundary at the end?",

    "story": [
      "On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including how it affects space weather at Earth.",
      "This was a landmark moment for humanity \u2013 but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all.",
      "Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby, the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C.",
      "But the success of these autonomous spacecraft \u2013 coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence \u2013 raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration.",
      "Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all.",
      "\"Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,\" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. \"I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space.\"",
      "He also points to the risk to humans.",
      "\"The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,\" he argues.",
      "Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. \"For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,\" he says. \"[They] go much further and do more things.\"",
      "They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. \"And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer.\"",
      "But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts \u2013 and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?",
      "Rovers verses mankind",
      "Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon.",
      "In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket).",
      "\"Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,\" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. \"It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant.\"",
      "But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.",
      "Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces.",
      "\"Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,\" says Dr Weinersmith.",
      "In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: \"A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep\u2026 It wants and asks for nothing.\"",
      "But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical \u2013 for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph.",
      "\"AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?\" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. \"I just don't think we know.\"",
      "He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be \"more efficient\".",
      "AI assistants and humanoid robots",
      "Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research.",
      "\"[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,\" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't.\"",
      "The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. \"We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has\" \u2013 meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM.",
      "Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.",
      "Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities.",
      "Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans.",
      "Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems.",
      "A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.",
      "\"If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,\" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. \"We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.\"",
      "He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.",
      "Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.",
      "\"You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.\"",
      "But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.",
      "\"Inspiration is something that is intangible,\" argues Prof Coates.",
      "Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. \"Humans relate when humans are doing something.",
      "\"The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing.\"",
      "Life on Mars?",
      "Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme.",
      "The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface.",
      "The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon.",
      "Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land.",
      "His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years.",
      "\"Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,\" explains Dr Weinersmith. \"If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary.\"",
      "However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved.",
      "\"Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,\" she says. \"There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to.",
      "\"I think we should be slowing down.\"",
      "Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. \"I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,\" he says.",
      "\"We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars.\"",

      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Some immigration hardliners say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",

      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine is losing the battle on the ground. Many of its soldiers are tired and exhausted after three years of fighting. The question \u2013 can the country endure another year of war?",
      "Their forces are still resisting Russian advances in the east. But they're almost surrounded near the town of Kurakhove \u2013 scene to some of the most intense fighting in recent weeks.",
      "The Black Pack, a mortar unit, is trying to prevent their encirclement around Kurakhove. The Russian are closing in on three sides.",
      "We meet the team at a safe house, getting a rest from the fighting. They're not your average soldiers. They include a vegan chef, a mechanic, a web developer and an artist. A group of friends with non-conformist views. Some call themselves anarchists. They all volunteered to fight.",
      "Surt, their 31-year-old commander, joined the army soon after Russia's full scale invasion. He tells me at the start he thought the war would last three years. Now, he says, he's mentally preparing himself for another ten years of fighting.",
      "They all know that Donald Trump wants to bring an end to the war. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and Russia's president have indicated they're prepared for talks too, but the idea of workable deal seems hard to imagine.",
      "So far, it is just talk about talks.",
      "Surt is not dismissive of Trump's goal.",
      "\"He is quite an ambitious person and I think he will try to do it,\" he says. But he worries about the outcome of any negotiations.",
      "\"We are realists, we understand there will be no justice for Ukraine \u2013 many will have to swallow the fact that their homes are destroyed by rockets and shells, that their loved ones were killed, and this will be hard.\"",
      "When I ask him whether he'd prefer to negotiate or to keep on fighting \u2013 Surt replies emphatically: \"Keep fighting.\"",
      "It's a view reflected by most of the unit. Serhiy, the vegan chef, believes negotiations would just temporarily freeze the war \u2013 \"and the conflict will return in a year or two.\"",
      "He admits the current situation is \"not good\" for Ukraine. But he too is ready to carry on fighting. Being killed, he says, \"is just an occupational hazard.\"",
      "Davyd, the artist, thinks Trump is worryingly unpredictable. \"He could be either very good or very bad for Ukraine,\" he says.",
      "The unit spends a week on the front and the next resting. But even when they're resting they continue to train, because, they say, it keeps them motivated.",
      "In a freezing field they go through the drills for firing their mortars. The team have recently been joined by Denys, who voluntarily left the safety of his home in Germany.",
      "\"I asked myself the question - could I live in a world where Ukraine doesn't exist?\" he says. He reluctantly admits it now appears to be losing, but adds: \"If you don't try then you will most certainly lose. At least I'll die trying to win instead of just lying down and taking it\".",
      "But, unlike the others, Denys says he thinks Ukraine should at least consider a ceasefire. He thinks Ukraine's casualties are higher than those officially admitted \u2013 more than 400,000 killed and injured. Mobilising more of the population, he believes, wouldn't solve the problem.",
      "\"I just think a lot of the motivated soldiers are either lost or they're pretty damn exhausted \u2013 and so for me it's not that we want a ceasefire, but we can't go on for many more years\" he says.",
      "Dnipro, Ukraine's third largest city,  reflects that sense of war weariness too. It's regularly targeted by Russian missiles and drones. The air-raid sirens wail intermittently, day and night. When they're silent, Ukrainians try to find some sense of normality in these abnormal times \u2013 including by going to the theatre.",
      "At an afternoon performance of a humorous play, called The Kaidash Family, there are still reminders of the war \u2013 a minute's silence to remember the fallen, followed by Ukraine's national anthem.",
      "But some in the audience admit they're also hoping for a longer-lasting release. Ludmyla tells me \"unfortunately there are fewer of us. We're getting some help, but it's not enough - that's why we have to sit down and negotiate.\"",
      "Kseniia says: \"There's no easy answer. A lot of our soldiers have been killed. They fought for something - for our territories. But I want the war to end\".",
      "Opinion polls too suggest there's increasing support for negotiations.",
      "Some of the strongest calls for a ceasefire come from those who've been forced to flee the fighting. In a shelter near the theatre, in former student accommodation, a group of four elderly women reminisce about the homes they've left behind.",
      "Eighty-seven-year-old Valentyna says they arrived with nothing, but have been provided with shoes, clothes and food. She says they've been treated well. \"It's good to be a guest, but its better to be at home.\"",
      "Her home is now in Russian-occupied territory. All four women want negotiations for peace. But Mariia, 89, says she doesn't know how either side will be able to \"look into the eyes of each other after the sheer hell they've committed\".",
      "She adds: \"It's already clear no one will win militarily, that is why we need negotiations.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:04:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Hurricane Beryl lashed the island in July, devastating much of its fishing fleet.",
    "story": [
      "There are few clearer signs of the destructive power that Hurricane Beryl unleashed on Barbados in July than the scene at the temporary boatyard in the capital, Bridgetown.",
      "Scores of mangled and cracked vessels sit on stacks, gaping holes in their hulls, their rudders snapped off and cabin windows broken.",
      "Yet these were the lucky ones.",
      "At least they can be repaired and put back out to sea. Many others sank, taking entire family incomes with them.",
      "When Beryl lashed Barbados, the island's fishing fleet was devastated in a matter of hours. About 75% of the active fleet was damaged, with 88 boats totally destroyed.",
      "Charles Carter, who owns a blue-and-black fishing vessel called Joyce, was among those affected.",
      "\"It's been real bad, I can tell you. I had to change both sides of the hull, up to the waterline,\" he says, pointing at the now pristine boat in front of us.",
      "It has taken months of restoration and thousands of dollars to get it back to this point, during which time Charles has barely been able to fish.",
      "\"That's my living, my livelihood, fishing is all I do,\" he says.",
      "\"The fishing industry is mash up,\" echoes his friend, Captain Euride. \"We're just trying to get back the pieces.\"",
      "Now, six months after the storm, there are signs of calmer waters. On a warm Saturday, several repaired vessels were put back into the ocean with the help of a crane, a trailer and some government support.",
      "Seeing Joyce back on the water is a welcome sight for all fishermen in Barbados.",
      "But Barbadians are acutely aware that climate change means more active and powerful Atlantic hurricane seasons - and it may be just another year or two before the fishing industry is struck again. Beryl, for example, was the earliest-forming Category 5 storm on record.",
      "Few understand the extent of the problem better than the island's Chief Fisheries Officer, Dr Shelly Ann Cox.",
      "\"Our captains have been reporting that sea conditions have changed,\" she explains. \"Higher swells, sea surface temperatures are much warmer and they're having difficulty getting flying fish now at the beginning of our pelagic season.\"",
      "The flying fish is a national symbol in Barbados and a key part of the island's cuisine. But climate change has been harming the stocks for years.",
      "At the Oistins Fish Market in Bridgetown, flying fish are still available, along with marlin, mahi-mahi and tuna, though only a handful of stalls are open.",
      "At one of them, Cornelius Carrington, from the Freedom Fish House. fillets a kingfish with the speed and dexterity of a man who has spent many years with a fish knife in his hands.",
      "\"Beryl was like a surprise attack, like an ambush,\" says Cornelius, in a deep baritone voice, over the market's chatter, reggae and thwack of cleavers on chopping boards.",
      "Cornelius lost one of his two boats in Hurricane Beryl. \"It's the first time a hurricane has come from the south like that, normally storms hit us from the north,\" he said.",
      "Although his second boat allowed him to stay afloat financially, Cornelius thinks the hand of climate change is increasingly present in the fishermen's fate.",
      "\"Right now, everything has changed. The tides are changing, the weather is changing, the temperature of the sea, the whole pattern has changed.\"",
      "The effects are also being felt in the tourism industry, he says, with hotels and restaurants struggling to find enough fish to meet demand each month.",
      "For Dr Shelly Ann Cox, public education is key and, she says, the message is getting through.",
      "\"Perhaps because we are an island and we're so connected to the water, people in Barbados can speak well on the impact on climate change and what that means for our country,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if you speak to children as well, they're very knowledgeable about the topic.\"",
      "To see for myself, I visited a secondary school \u2013 Harrison College \u2013 as a member of a local NGO, the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network (CYEN), talked to members of the school's Environmental Club about climate change.",
      "The CYEN representative, Sheldon Marshall, is an energy expert who quizzed the pupils about greenhouse gases and the steps they could take at home to help reduce carbon emissions on the island.",
      "\"How can you, as young people in Barbados, help make a difference on climate change?\" he asked them.",
      "Following an engaging and lively debate, I asked the pupils how they felt about Barbados being on the front line of global climate change, despite having only a small carbon footprint itself.",
      "\"Personally, I take a very pessimistic view,\" said 17-year-old Isabella Fredricks.",
      "\"We are a very small country. No matter how hard we try to change, if the big countries \u2013 the main producers of pollution like America, India and China \u2013 don't make a change, everything we do is going to be pointless.\"",
      "Her classmate, Tenusha Ramsham, is slightly more optimistic.",
      "\"I think that all great big leaps in history were made when people collaborated and innovated,\" she argues. \"I don't think we should be completely disheartened because research, innovation, creating technology and education will ultimately lead to the future that we want.\"",
      "\"I feel if we can communicate to the global superpowers the pain that we feel seeing this happen to our environment,\" adds 16-year-old Adrielle Baird, \"then it would help them to understand and help us collaborate to find ways to fix the issues that we're seeing.\"",
      "For the island's young people, their very futures are at stake. Rising sea levels now pose an existential threat to the small islands of the Caribbean.",
      "It is a point on which the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, has become a global advocate for change \u2013 urging greater action over an impending climate catastrophe in her speech at COP29 and calling for economic compensation from the world's industrialised nations.",
      "On its shores and in its seas, it feels like Barbados is under siege - dealing with issues from coral bleaching to coastal erosion. While the impetus for action comes from the island's youth, it is the older generations who have borne witness as the changes unfold.",
      "Steven Bourne has fished the waters around Barbados his whole life and lost two boats in Hurricane Beryl. As we look out at the coastline from a dilapidated beach-hut bar, he says the island's sands have shifted before his very eyes.",
      "\"It's an attack from the elements. You see it taking the beaches away, but years ago you'd be sitting here, and you could see the water's edge coming upon the sand. Now you can't because the sand's built up so much.\"",
      "By coincidence, in the same bar where I chatted to Steven was Home Affairs Minister Wilfred Abrahams, who has responsibility for national disaster management.",
      "I put it to him that it must be a a difficult time for disaster management in the Caribbean.",
      "\"The whole landscape has changed entirely,\" he replied. \"Once upon a time, it was rare to get a Category Five hurricane in any year. Now we're getting them every year. So the intensity and the frequency are cause for concern.\"",
      "Even the duration of the hurricane season has changed, he says.",
      "\"We used to have a rhyme that went: June, too soon; July, standby; October, all over,\" he tells me. Extreme weather events like Beryl have rendered such an idea obsolete.",
      "\"What we can expect has changed, what we've prepared for our whole lives and what our culture is built around has changed,\" he adds.",
      "Fisherman Steven Bourne had hoped to retire before Beryl. Now, he says, he and the rest of the islanders have no choice but to keep going.",
      "\"Being afraid or anything like that don't make no sense. Because there's nowhere for we to go. We love this rock. And we will always be on this rock.\"",

    "summary": "Growers find that the changing climate is having a big impact on the size of their harvests.",
    "story": [
      "In the lush, volcanic highlands of Komothai in central Kenya, farmers like Simon Macharia produce coffee on small plantations scattered across the hillsides.",
      "Along with other farmers, Mr Macharia brings sacks of his bright red coffee cherries to the local processing plant, where they are weighed and treated.",
      "A machine removes the red husks, and the pale beans inside are washed and passed along concrete channels, ending up on lines of drying platforms that sweep across the valley.",
      "Here, workers categorise the beans into grades, the highest destined for the coffee houses of Europe.",
      "\"We call coffee the black gold around here,\" Mr Macharia, whose farm covers 2.5 hectares (six acres) , told the BBC.",
      "He grows the Kenya AA coffee beans, which are prized worldwide for their high quality, full body, deep aromas and fruity flavour.",
      "The crop has been part of these lush highlands since the late 1890s, when British colonial settlers introduced it.",
      "Now, the area is famous for its unique, top-rated coffee.",
      "Growing the berries is labour intensive - picking, pruning, weeding, spraying, fertilising and transporting the products.",
      "\"Coffee requires your full-time concentration, especially when it starts to bloom,\" Mr Macharia said.",
      "\"From that moment up until the day that you are going to harvest - those six months, your full-time job is on the farm.\"",

      "The bean that could change the taste of coffee",
      "Coffee price surges to highest on record",
      "A coffee tree is a huge investment for cash-strapped farmers, as it can take four years for the fruits to mature.",
      "The price of a single cup of coffee in a chic European caf\u00e9, typically $4 (\u00a33.20), highlights a stark disparity when compared to the earnings of many Kenyan coffee labourers, who make at most $2.30 a day.",
      "Edita Mwangi, who harvests coffee cherries on the red earth hillside overlooking the processing plant, confirms this.",
      "\"They don't know the poverty we suffer. You have to struggle day and night just to survive,\" she said.",
      "With four children depending on her, Ms Mwangi works six days a week, earning about $1.40 a day.",
      "She has to walk 5km (three miles) to reach the farm where she works.",
      "Farmers feel the trading system between Kenya and Europe - the world's largest coffee market - has been stacked against them for many years.",
      "But now, a new threat looms, jeopardising farmers' ability to make a living - climate change.",
      "Coffee trees are extremely sensitive to small differences in temperature and weather conditions.",
      "They also need specific climatic conditions like humid temperatures and ample rainfall to grow.",
      "\"Climate change is a major challenge for our coffee farmers,\" says John Murigi, the chairman of the Komothai Coffee Society, which represents 8,000 coffee farmers like Mr Macharia.",
      "Cold temperatures and erratic rainfall are having a devastating impact on the delicate coffee plants, said Mr Murigi.",
      "As a result, \"coffee production has decreased over the last few years\".",
      "He added that climate change was intensifying the spread of diseases in coffee plants.",
      "Mr Murigi said there had been a significant increase in coffee leaf miners, bugs that feed on coffee leaves, and coffee berry disease, a destructive fungal infection that can wipe out more than 80% of crops.",
      "To deal with the increasing outbreaks, farmers are resorting to using herbicides and insecticides that can damage soil quality in the long term and also pose health risks.",
      "Farmers use dangerous herbicides like Roundup, which contain glyphosates known to cause cancers - banned in some European countries - to ensure they get a good harvest.",
      "Pest Control Products Board (PCPB) of Kenya, in charge of regulating the use of these products, did not respond to a BBC request for comment.",
      "To produce a single cup of coffee can require up to 140 litres of water - including the water to grow the plants.",
      "But higher temperatures and changing rainfall patterns mean a decreasing water supply for coffee farmers in Kiambu County.",
      "Farmer Joseph Kimani told the BBC that the \"river levels have gone down a lot\" due to erratic weather, such as periods of drought and heavy rains.",
      "He said that because of the lack of rain, farmers are forced to use more river water.",
      "But this increased reliance on river water, driven by the lack of rainfall, may be further straining the already limited water supply.",
      "While Mr Murigi acknowledges the rise in water use by coffee farmers, he denies this is why the river is drying up.",
      "However, with 23 coffee societies in this region, a significant amount of water is clearly being used in the coffee growing process in Kiambu County.",
      "Komothia's story is not unique. As global temperatures and droughts increase, good coffee will become difficult to grow in all parts of the world.",
      "Coffee can only be grown in the \"coffee belt\" - tropical regions around the world in areas typically located at an altitude of between 1,000m and 2,000m.",
      "In recent years, climate change has led to a shortage of global coffee supplies and an increase in the price of coffee due to drought and crop failures in several key coffee-producing nations such as Brazil and Vietnam.",
      "A survey by Fairtrade International, the organisation behind Fairtrade labels, found that 93% of Kenyan coffee farmers are already experiencing the effects of climate change.",
      "The coffee industry in Kenya is a key source of employment, providing jobs for an estimated 150,000 people.",
      "To protect the industry, coffee farmers in areas like Komothai are experimenting with climate adaptation techniques, such as planting trees to provide extra shade for the coffee plants.",
      "Mr Murigi said it is only through addressing both the climate and economic challenges faced by Kenyan coffee farmers that they can have a sustainable future.",
      "However, coffee farmers like Mr Macharia are pessimistic about the industry's future.",

      "Special education teacher Robin Ginkel has spent almost two years fighting with her insurance company to try to get it to pay for back surgery that her doctors recommended after a work injury left her with a herniated disc and debilitating pain.",
      "The plan didn't seem \"ridiculous\", she said: \"I'm asking to get healthcare to return to a normal quality of life and return to work.\"",
      "Initially rejected, the 43-year-old from Minnesota spent hours on hold appealing the decision - even lodging a complaint with the state - only to see her claims denied three times.",
      "Now she is bracing for the battle to start again, after deciding her best option was to try her luck with a new insurance company.",
      "\"It's exhausting,\" she said. \"I can't keep going like this.\"",
      "Ms Ginkel is not alone in throwing up her hands.",
      "Roughly one in five Americans covered by private health insurance reported their provider refused to pay for care recommended by a doctor last year, according to a survey by health policy foundation KFF.",
      "Brian Mulhern, a 54-year-old from Rhode Island, said his health insurance firm recently rejected a request to pay for a colonoscopy after polyps were discovered on his colon - a discovery that prompted his doctor to advise a follow-up exam within three years instead of the typical five.",
      "Faced with $900 in out-of-pocket costs, Mr Mulhern put off the procedure.",
      "Long simmering anger about insurance decisions exploded into public view earlier this month after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was murdered - and the killing unleashed a startling wave of public outrage at the industry.",
      "The crime sent shockwaves through the system, prompting one insurance company to reverse a controversial plan to limit anaesthesia coverage, and hit the share prices of major firms.",
      "Though the reaction raised the possibility that scrutiny might force change, experts said addressing the frustration would require action from Washington, where there is little sign of a change in momentum.",
      "On the contrary: just in the last few weeks, Congress again failed to move forward long-stalled measures aimed at making it easier for people on certain government-backed insurance plans to get their claims approved.",
      "Killing of insurance CEO reveals simmering anger at US health system",
      "Who was Brian Thompson, healthcare CEO gunned down in New York?",
      "Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty to murdering healthcare CEO",
      "Many advocates are also concerned about problems worsening, as Donald Trump returns to the White House.",
      "The president-elect has pledged to protect Medicare, which is government health insurance for over-65s and some younger people. He is known for longstanding criticism of parts of the health industry, such as high prices for medicines.",
      "But he has also vowed to loosen regulation, pursue privatisation and add work requirements to publicly available insurance and cut government spending, of which healthcare is a major part.",
      "\"The way things stand today, healthcare is a target,\" said David Lipschutz, co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a non-profit that seeks to advance comprehensive Medicare coverage.",
      "\"They're going to try to take people's health insurance away or diminish people's access to it and that's going in the opposite direction of some of these frustrations and would only make problems worse.\"",
      "Republicans, who control Congress, have historically backed reforms aimed at making the health system more transparent, cutting regulation and reducing the government's role.",
      "\"If you take government bureaucrats out of the healthcare equation and you have doctor-patient relationships, it's better for everybody,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a video obtained by NBC News last month. \"More efficient, more effective,\" he said. \"That's the free market. Trump's going to be for the free market.\"",
      "Unhappiness with the health system is longstanding in the US, where experts - including at KFF - point out that care is more expensive than in other countries and performance is worse on basic metrics such as life expectancy, infant mortality and safety during childbirth.",
      "The US spent more than $12,000 (\u00a39,600) per person on healthcare in 2022 - almost twice the average of other wealthy countries, according to the Peter G Peterson Foundation.",
      "The last major reform, under former president Barack Obama in 2010, focused on expanding health insurance in hopes of making care more accessible.",
      "The law included measures to widen eligibility for Medicaid, another government programme that helps cover medical costs for people with limited incomes. It also forbid insurers from rejecting patients with \"pre-existing conditions\", successfully reducing the share of the population without insurance from about 15% to roughly 8%.",
      "Today, about 40% of the population in the US gets insurance from taxpayer-funded government plans - mostly Medicare and Medicaid - with coverage increasingly contracted out to private companies.",
      "The remainder are enrolled in plans from private companies, which are typically selected by employers and paid for with a mix of personal contributions and employer funds.",
      "Even though more people are covered than ever before, frustrations remain widespread. In a recent Gallup poll, just 28% of respondents rated health care coverage excellent or good, the lowest level since 2008.",
      "Public data on the rate of insurance denials - which can also happen after care has been received, leaving patients with hefty bills - is limited.",
      "But surveys of patients and medical professionals suggest insurance companies are requiring more \"prior authorisation\" for procedures - and rejections by insurance companies are on the rise.",
      "In the state of Maryland, for example, the number of claim denials disclosed by insurers has jumped more than 70% over five years, according to reports from the state attorney general's office.",
      "\"The fact that we pay into the system and then when we need it, we can't access the care we need makes no sense,\" said Ms Ginkel. \"As I went through the process, it felt more and more like [the insurance companies] do this on purpose in hopes you're going to give up.\"",
      "Brian Mulhern, the Rhode Islander who put off his colonoscopy, compared the industry to the \"legal mafia\" - offering protection \"but on their terms\". He added: \"It increasingly seems to be that you can pay more and more and get nothing.\"",
      "AHIP, a lobby group for health insurers, said claims denials often reflected faulty submissions by doctors, or pre-determined decisions about what to cover that had been made by regulators and employers.",
      "UnitedHealthcare did not respond to a BBC request for comment for this article. But in an opinion piece written after the killing of its CEO Brian Thompson, Andrew Witty, head of the firm's parent company, defended the industry's decision-making.",
      "He said it was based on a \"comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety\".",
      "But critics complain that a for-profit health system will always be focused on its shareholders and bottom line, and have linked the surge in claims denial to the rising using of allegedly error-prone artificial intelligence (AI) to review requests.",
      "One developer said last year its AI tool was not being used to inform coverage decisions - only to help guide providers on how to aid patients.",
      "Derrick Crowe, communications and digital director of People's Action, a non-profit that advocates for insurance reform, said he was hopeful the shock of the murder would force change on the industry.",
      "\"This is a moment to take a moment of private pain and turn it into a public collective power to ensure companies stop denying our care,\" he said.",
      "Whether the murder will strengthen appetite for reform remains to be seen.",
      "Politicians from both parties in Washington have expressed interest in efforts that might rein in the industry, such as toughening oversight of algorithms and rules that would require the break-up of big firms.",
      "But there is little sign the proposals have meaningful traction.",
      "Trump's nominee to run the powerful Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), TV doctor Mehmet Oz, has previously endorsed expanding coverage by Medicare Advantage - which offers Medicare health plans through private companies.",
      "\"These plans are popular among seniors, consistently provide quality care and have a needed incentive to keep costs low,\" he explained in 2022.",
      "Prof Buntin said Republican election gains indicate that the US is not about to embrace the alternative - a publicly run scheme like the UK's National Health Service - anytime soon.",
      "\"There's a distrust of people who seem to be profiting or benefiting off of illness - and yet that's the basis of the American system,\" she said."

      "The plane, which was returning from Bangkok, Thailand, was carrying 181 people - 179 of whom were killed. Two crew members were rescued from the wreckage.",
      "Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, with fire officials indicating a bird strike and bad weather. However experts have warned the crash could have been caused by a number of factors.",
      "What happened?",
      "Flight 7C2216 was a Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air, Korea's most popular budget airline.",
      "Air traffic control authorised the plane to land at Muan International Airport at about 08:54 (23:54 GMT) - just three minutes before issuing a warning about bird activity in the area.",

      "'It's unbearable': Families criticise lack of updates as investigators search debris",
      "Video captures moments before crash",
      "Watch: At the scene of the investigation",
      "At 08:59, the pilot reported that the plane had struck a bird, declaring \"mayday mayday mayday\" and \"bird strike, bird strike, go-around\". The pilot then aborted the original landing and requested permission to land from the opposite direction.",
      "Air traffic control authorised the alternative landing at 09:01 - and at 09:02 the plane made contact with the ground, coming down at roughly the halfway point of the 2,800m runway.",
      "One video appears to show the plane touching down without using its wheels or any other landing gear. It skidded down the runway, overshot it and crashed into a wall, before erupting into flames.",
      "A witness told the South Korean news agency Yonhap they had heard a \"loud bang\" followed by a \"series of explosions\".",
      "Videos from the scene show the plane ablaze with smoke billowing into the sky. Fire crews later extinguished the fire.",
      "The first of two survivors was rescued from the crash at about 09:23, with the second being rescued from inside the tail section of the plane at about 09:50.",
      "Could a bird strike have contributed to the crash?",
      "Lee Jeong-hyun, chief of the Muan fire department, told a televised briefing that a bird strike and bad weather might have caused the crash - but that the exact cause was still being investigated.",
      "The flight and voice recorders from the plane were recovered, though Yonhap reports that the former was damaged.",
      "An investigator told the news agency that the black boxes could take up to a month to decode.",
      "One passenger on the flight messaged a relative, saying that a bird had been \"stuck in the wing\" and that the plane could not land, local media reported.",

      "The head of Jeju Air's management said that the crash was not due to \"any maintenance issues\", Yonhap reported.",
      "The South Korean transport department said that the head pilot on the flight had held the role since 2019 and had more than 6,800 hours of flight experience.",
      "Geoffrey Thomas, an aviation expert and editor of Airline News, told the BBC that South Korea and its airlines were considered \"industry best practice\" and that both the aircraft and the airline had an \"excellent safety record\".",
      "Mr Thomas separately told Reuters news agency that he was sceptical that a bird strike alone could have caused the crash.",
      "\"A bird strike is not unusual. Problems with an undercarriage are not unusual. Bird strikes happen far more often, but typically they don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves,\" he said.",
      "Who are the plane crash victims and survivors?",
      "The plane was carrying 175 passengers and six crew. Two of the passengers were Thai and the rest are believed to have been South Korean, authorities have said. Many are thought to have been returning from a Christmas holiday in Thailand.",

      "Five of the people who died were children under the age of 10. The youngest passenger was a three-year-old boy and the oldest was 78, authorities said, citing the passenger manifest.",
      "\"I can't believe the entire family has just disappeared,\" Maeng Gi-Su, 78, whose nephew and grand-nephews were on the flight, told the BBC. \"My heart aches so much.\"",
      "South Korea's National Fire Agency said two members of the flight crew - a man and a woman - had survived the crash.",
      "The man has woken up and is \"fully able to communicate,\" according to Yonhap, which cites the director of the Seoul hospital where he is being treated.",
      "More than 1,500 emergency personnel have been deployed as part of recovery efforts, including 490 fire employees and 455 police officers. They have been searching the area around the runway for parts of the plane and those who were onboard.",
      "What are officials doing now?",
      "Acting President Choi Sang-mok has has ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operations.",
      "Muan has also been declared a special disaster zone, which makes central government funding available to the local government and victims.",
      "All flights to and from Muan International Airport have been cancelled.",
      "A national seven-day period of mourning has been declared, and New Year's Day celebrations in the country are likely to be cancelled or scaled down.",
      "Aircraft maker Boeing has said it is in touch with Jeju Air and stands \"ready to support them\".",
      "Jeju Air has apologised to families, with its chief executive saying in a news conference that the airline had no history of accidents. It is believed that Sunday's crash has been the airline's only fatal accident since it was launched in 2005.",
      "What is a bird strike?",
      "A bird strike is a collision between a plane in flight and a bird. They are very common - in the UK, there were more than 1,400 bird strikes reported in 2022, only about 100 of which affected the plane, according to data from the Civil Aviation Authority.",
      "The best known bird strike occurred in 2009, when an Airbus plane made an emergency landing on New York's Hudson River after colliding with a flock of geese. All 155 passengers and crew survived.",
      "Professor Doug Drury, who teaches aviation at CQUniversity Australia, wrote in an article for The Conversation this summer that Boeing planes - like Airbus and Embraer - had turbofan engines, which could be severely damaged in a bird strike.",
      "He said that pilots were trained to be especially vigilant during the early morning or at sunset, when birds were most active.",
      "But some aviation experts are sceptical about whether a bird strike could have caused the crash at Muan Airport.",
      "\"Typically they [bird strikes] don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves,\" Mr Thomas told Reuters.",
      "Australian airline safety expert Geoffrey Dell also told the news agency: \"I've never seen a bird strike prevent the landing gear from being extended.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 02:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, apparently ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, apparently ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
      "Jolie and Pitt signed off on a default declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday, saying they've entered into a written agreement on their marital and property rights. The settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "Jolie's attorney, James Simon, told CBS News in a statement that, \"More than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "A representative for Pitt, Benjamin Soley, declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "The filing says they give up the right to any future spousal financial support, but gives no other details. A judge will need to sign off on the agreement.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood's most prominent pairings for 12 years, two of them as a married couple. The Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. The FBI and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services investigated Pitt's actions on the flight and deemed that no action needed to be taken against him.",
      "A judge in 2019 declared them divorced and single, but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.",
      "Soon after, a private judge the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start the process over.",
      "During the long divorce fight, four of the couple's six children became adults, negating the need for a custody agreement for them. The only two who are still minors are 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. In June, one of their daughters, then known as Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, successfully petitioned to remove Pitt's name from hers.",
      "Their other children are 23-year-old Maddox, 21-year-old Pax and 19-year-old Zahara.",
      "No details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couple's use of the private judge - an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years - has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. There have been no official court actions in the case in nearly a year, and no indication that the two had been nearing an agreement.",
      "Some details on their disputes, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Jolie instead sold her part of the winery, Chateau Miraval, to the Tenute del Mondo wine group, a subsidiary of the Stoli Group, which Pitt said was a \"vindictive\" move that ruined a private space that had been a second home.",
      "Jolie's attorneys said the winery sale agreement broke down over Pitt's demand that as part of the deal she sign a wide-ranging non-disclosure agreement about him. In court documents, she called that an attempt to cover up his physical abuse of her, which she said turned toward the children on the 2016 flight.",
      "Along with the federal and L.A. County officials, the initial judge in the case heard testimony on the allegations before deciding to give Pitt equal custody of the children.",
      "It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect the winery lawsuit.",
      "Publicly, both Pitt and Jolie have been extremely tight-lipped on everything surrounding their split, despite robust promotional tours and many media appearances for various projects.",
      "Pitt said in a 2017 interview with GQ that he had had a drinking problem at the time of the plane incident and the split, but had since become sober and was going to therapy. He has not defended his behavior on the family flight.",
      "Jolie has also declined to make any public statements about the family issues or the divorce, though she has sought a broader examination and airing of his behavior by the courts in both the divorce and winery cases.",
      "Both Jolie and Pitt were among the most elite stars in film when they began dating in 2004, after co-starring as hitman-and-hitwoman spouses in \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" and remained atop the Hollywood A-list throughout their coupling. The daughter of Hollywood luminary Jon Voight and the star of \"Maleficent\" and \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\" Jolie won an Oscar for her performance in 1999's \"Girl, Interrupted.\"",
      "Pitt, the star of \"Fight Club\" and \"Inglourious Basterds,\" thrived as both actor and producer after the split. He won his own Academy Award for 2019's \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" the crowning achievement in an awards season that some in media framed as a redemption and brought major public affection for him.",
      "Jolie has kept a less visible profile in the years since the divorce, though she directed several films and appeared in several more while trying to focus on raising the children.",
      "She has very much returned to the Oscar conversation this year for her portrayal of the legendary soprano Maria Callas in \"Maria.\"",

      "An Argentine judge confirmed charges against five people in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, and ordered preventive prison for two of them for having supplied him with drugs.",
      "A judicial officer confirmed Monday the judge's decision and said that one of the two people ordered to be put under preventive prison \u2014 a form of pre-trial detention \u2014 was an employee of the hotel in Buenos Aires where Payne stayed until he died after falling from the balcony of his room in October.",

      "Linda Lavin, a Tony Award-winning stage actress who became a working class icon as a paper-hat wearing waitress on the TV sitcom \"Alice,\" has died. She was 87.",
      "Lavin died unexpectedly Sunday of complications from recently discovered lung cancer, her representative, Michael Gagliardo, told CBS News in an email.",
      "A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress.",
      "The title was shortened to \"Alice\" and Lavin become a role model for working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin singing the theme song \"There's a New Girl in Town,\" ran from 1976 to 1985.",
      "The show turned \"Kiss my grits\" into a catchphrase and co-starred Polly Holliday as waitress Flo and Vic Tayback as the gruff owner and head chef of Mel's Diner.",
      "The series bounced around the CBS schedule during its first two seasons but became a hit leading into \"All in the Family\" on Sunday nights in October 1977. It was among primetime's top 10 series in four of the next five seasons. Variety magazine listed it among the all-time best workplace comedies.",
      "Lavin soon went on to win a Tony for best actress in a play for Neil Simon's \"Broadway Bound\" in 1987.",
      "She was working as recently as this month promoting a new Netflix series in which she appears, \"No Good Deed,\" and filming a forthcoming Hulu series, \"Mid-Century Modern,\" according to Deadline, which first reported her death.",
      "Lavin grew up in Portland, Maine, and moved to New York City after graduating from the College of William and Mary. She sang in nightclubs and in ensemble shows.",
      "Iconic producer and director Hal Prince gave Lavin her first big break while directing the Broadway musical \"It's a Bird ... It's a Plane ... It's Superman.\" She went on to earn a Tony nomination in Simon's \"Last of the Red Hot Lovers\" in 1969 before winning a Tony 18 years later for another Simon play, \"Broadway Bound.\"",
      "In the mid 1970s, Lavin moved to Los Angeles. She had a recurring role on \"Barney Miller\" and in 1976 was chosen to star in \"Alice.\"",
      "Back on Broadway, Lavin later starred Paul Rudnick's comedy \"The New Century,\" had a concert show called \"Songs & Confessions of a One-Time Waitress\" and earned a Tony nomination in Donald Margulies' \"Collected Stories.\"",
      "Michael Kuchwara of The Associated Press raved about Lavin in \"Collected Stories,\" writing that she \"gives one of those complete, nuanced performances, capturing the woman's intellectual vigor, her wry sense of humor and her increasing physical frailty with astonishing fidelity. And Lavin's sense of timing is superb, whether delivering a joke or acerbically dissecting the work of her protegee.\"",
      "Lavin basked in a burst of renewed attention in her 70s, earning a Tony nomination for Nicky Silver's \"The Lyons.\" She also starred in \"Other Desert Cities\" and a revival of \"Follies\" before they transferred to Broadway.",
      "The AP again raved about Lavin in \"The Lyons,\" calling her \"an absolute wonder to behold as Rita Lyons, a nag of a mother with a collection of firm beliefs and eye rolls, a matriarch who is both suffocating and keeping everyone at arm's length.\"",
      "She also appeared in the film \"Wanderlust\" with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, and released her first CD, \"Possibilities.\" She played Jennifer Lopez's grandmother in \"The Back-Up Plan.\"",
      "When asked for guidance for up-and-coming actresses, Lavin stressed one thing. \"I say that what happened for me was that work brings work. As long as it wasn't morally reprehensible to me, I did it,\" she told the AP in 2011.",
      "She and Steve Bakunas, an artist, musician and her third husband, converted an old automotive garage into the 50-seat Red Barn Studio Theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina.",
      "It opened in 2007 and their productions include \"Doubt\" by John Patrick Shanley, \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" by David Mamet, \"Rabbit Hole\" by David Lindsay-Abaire and \"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife\" by Charles Busch, in which Lavin also starred on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination.",
      "She returned to TV in 2013 in \"Sean Saves the World,\" starring \"Will & Grace's\" Sean Hayes, a show that lasted a season. Lavin also made appearances on \"Mom\" and \"9JKL.\""

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:38:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The comedian, who will host the Golden Globes on January 5, says she thrives on anxiety.",
    "story": [
      "\"When you're a white, pasty girl, you get a spray tan, everyone's nicer to you!\" said Nikki Glaser during her standup act. \"They think, like, you've been on vacation, they think things are going well in your life. And they're not; you've just stood naked in front of a teenager. \u2026 And in the middle of her spraying me, like, seeing my butt, she goes, 'I'm such a fan!'\"",
      "Glaser thought she had her January all planned out: \"So, for January 2025, I was going to possibly have, like, a brow lift or some kind of, like, really invasive surgery that I've been, you know, looking into getting.\"",
      "The kind of procedure where you have to disappear from the public for a while, and then re-emerge. But then, she got a phone call from TWO of her agents: \"And when it's two, you know it's good news, because when it's bad news, they just make one person do it, 'cause no one wants to do that! And they're like, 'So, this operation, is there any way you could push it 'til maybe the second week of January?'\"",
      "That's because on January 5, Glaser is hosting the Golden Globes on CBS \u2013 just another big gig in a year that's been filled with them.",
      "Her 2024 special, \"Someday You'll Die,\" was nominated for an Emmy, a Grammy and a Golden Globe.",
      "\"It's easy to be a bad mom; that's so easy. But to be a good mom is hard. To be a bad mom, that's as easy as being a great dad.\"",
      "But it's the special's theme song that Glaser wrote that she's most proud of: \"Honestly, it might be, like, one of the things I'm most proud of in my entire life.\"",
      "\"It couldn't be more different than joke writing, right, in terms of the vulnerability?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, yes, because everything with joking is, like, I get vulnerable, then I cut it with, like, some kind of line that's like, 'I'm just kidding.' I was talking about my depression, but we're all not gonna get emotional here. There's just something so embarrassing about being emotional for me. So, I think I just have to reframe it as like, 'You can't do it, Nikki. It's too hard,' and I'll be like, 'Yes, I can.'\"",
      "Glaser made her name in celebrity roasts with a searing joke style, deadpanning at her own expense and the expense of others, jokes we mostly can't play for you on network TV \u2013 all of which came in handy earlier this year when she roasted NFL great Tom Brady live on Netflix.",
      "\"Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? I mean, even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.'\"",
      "Glaser says, though she's mostly done with roasts, she actually asked Netflix for the job: \"I was like, 'Tell Tom Brady I'm the Tom Brady of roasting.' It's flattery, but it's also true. I meant it. I really feel like Tom Brady is a guy that worked hard enough to become how great he is.\"",
      "The same could be said about Glaser \u2026 and the Golden Globes will be her biggest audience to date. \"I'm gonna nail it,\" she said. \"Maybe I won't nail it in some people's eyes, but I will have nailed it in my eyes because I have set up a system leading up to it that I couldn't possibly work harder on it.\"",
      "More on that system later \u2026 because confidence is not something that's always come easy to Glaser.",
      "She's talked about struggles with self-medicating, eating disorders, and alcoholism. \"I drank every single night of my life and it was, like, the only thing I looked forward to in my life,\" she said. \"For me, drinking was the worst of all of them. And it's been kind of whack-a-mole with all of those. But those have never caused me as much pain as drinking did. So, I'm glad that drinking is just not an option.\"",
      "I said, \"In recovery they talk about this thing called, like, the 'dis-ease' \u2013 just this kind of general state of not being at ease.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Glaser said. \"The obsession with work is, like, just not wanting to feel.\"",
      "Will the pressure of hosting the Globes get to Glaser? She says she hopes it does. \"I thrive on anxiety,\" she said. \"I like feeling like, 'Oh, what's gonna happen?' I like that feeling. I kill it when I'm anxious.\"",
      "Glaser's \"system,\" which she first developed for the Brady roast, is working with a team of writers that includes Sean O'Conner, Jessica Dweck, and Glaser's longtime boyfriend and collaborator, Chris Convy.",
      "Those jokes they come up are then tested over and over, both on the road and in small L.A. clubs, to see what real audiences think.",
      "\"I did have a bunch of Ozempic jokes that I was gonna tell, but I lost them. The natural way, I swear! I just cut out soda.\"",
      "The Golden Globes audience will decide on January 5th if all this preparation by Glaser has paid off. But she says, in a certain way, she's already working on her next project, an off-stage one at that.",
      "\"I think my new challenge is, I wanna be known for being a nice celebrity,\" Glaser said. \"I just wanna be someone that people go, 'Oh, she's really great to work with. She was really nice to us,' and not in an inauthentic way.\"",
      "\"You wanna spread kindness to people while you're eviscerating their entire existence in your periphery?\" I asked.",
      "\"That's the paradox of it,\" she said. \"I wanna spread honesty.\"",

That would allow defense lawyers to collect facts necessary to prepare for trial. Torres also cited \"substantial interest\" from the public.",
      "The Manhattan jurist also chastised Alex Spiro \u2014 the lawyer representing Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter \u2014 for what she described as his \"relentless filing of combative motions containing inflammatory language and ad hominem attacks\" against the plaintiff's lawyer, calling them \"inappropriate, a waste of judicial resources, and a tactic unlikely to benefit his client.\"",
      "Torres wrote in her order Thursday that Spiro, who has been on the case less than three weeks, has submitted a \"litany of letters and motions attempting to impugn the character of Plaintiff's lawyer, many of them expounding on the purported 'urgency' of this case.\"",
      "In response to the ruling, Tony Buzbee, the plaintiff's attorney, told CBS News in an email Thursday evening that he doesn't \"typically comment on court rulings,\" but alleged that \"the coordinated and desperate efforts to attack me as counsel for alleged victims are falling flat.\"",

      "Combs remains jailed in New York awaiting a criminal trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

      "Citing an interview the plaintiff did with NBC News, Spiro wrote that the broadcast revealed \"glaring inconsistencies and outright impossibilities\" in the plaintiff's story.

    "summary": "\"I feel like we should've learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" Dr. Leana Wen said.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Leana Wen said Sunday that the lack of testing for bird flu doesn't mean that the virus isn't alive in humans, and that she feels the federal government \"should have learned our lesson from COVID\" and should be proactive in making tests available for Americans \u2014 and not wait for labs to characterize the cases and their severity.",
      "\"I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not,\" she added.",
      "The recent outbreak of bird flu stems from a mutation of the H5N1 virus that affects humans more easily, compared to past mutations of the virus that targeted birds and not mammals.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC reported its first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. found in a patient in Louisiana who was infected from a backyard poultry flock. The Louisiana case was first confirmed by health officials Friday, adding to the total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. Another severe case of H5N1 has been reported in a teen in British Columbia.",
      "According to the CDC, the mutations found in humans seemed to develop as the virus adapted to its host. The genetic changes in the H5N1 samples from the infected human were not present in the samples from the backyard poultry flock that infected the patient, suggesting that the concerning mutations had not developed until after the transmission of the virus. Federal health officials in the report said that spread between close contacts is more likely when these changes develop during the clinical course of a human infection.",
      "\"It's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors,\" Wen said\u00a0 Sunday, adding that this mutation allows a person to have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "Wen added that she believes the number of H5N1 cases currently reported in the U.S. is likely an undercount due to the lack of testing.",
      "\"We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states; 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing,\" Wen said.",
      "Wen on Sunday also urged the Biden administration to approve the H5N1 vaccine, which is already developed and contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses but awaits FDA authorization \u2013 a key difference from the beginning stages of COVID.",
      "\"There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people,\" Wen said. \"I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility.\"",
      "The push for immediate authorization of vaccines and additional testing is rooted in concern that the Trump administration could potentially delay vaccines.",
      "\"I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence,\" Wen said. \"Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID.\"",
      "Some of President-elect Trump's cabinet picks like Dr. Marty Makary, who is set to lead the FDA, Wen described as \"very competent\" and an \"independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.\" There is more concern, however, over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services,\" Wen said.\u00a0 \"Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti-vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades.\"",

      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Who qualifies for an H-1B visa?",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says\u00a0the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a \"theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\" and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field.",
      "Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working.",
      "How many workers receive H-1B visas?",
      "The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that.",
      "However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program.",
      "What countries do H-1B recipients come from?",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report.",
      "What's the debate about H-1B visas?",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions.",
      "But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Some investigations, including a 2017\u00a0report from CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers.",
      "What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas?",
      "Trump has not officially outlined his policy preferences on the H-1B program, but he\u00a0told The New York Post in a Dec. 28 interview that he has \"always been in favor of the visas.\"",
      "\"I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times; it's a great program,\" he added. His presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Still, Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge to conduct mass deportations, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \"very bad\" and \"unfair\" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We tend to think of ourselves as citizens, or at least residents, of a nation.",
      "After all, the lessons most of us encountered in school included a map of the world divided by lines into countries. Each country, we learned, has a government; and each government rules over its land and its things and its people. The idea of one land, one law, one people, and one government is dominant, powerful, and often accurate. It forms the basis for much of national and international law.",
      "The hidden globe is a kind of transfiguration of this map, an accretion of cracks and concessions, suspensions and abstractions, carve-outs and free zones, and other places without nationality in the conventional sense, stretching from the ocean floor to outer space. The hidden globe is a mercenary world order in which the power to make and shape law is bought, sold, hacked, reshaped, deterritorialized, reterritorialized, transplanted, and reimagined. It is state power catapulted beyond a state's borders. It is also a state's selective abdication of certain powers within its remit: enclaves filled not by lawlessness but by different, weirder laws.",
      "The concept of the loophole originated in the seventeenth century to describe the small vertical slits in a castle wall through which archers could fire without risking enemy exposure. Its modern meaning has not changed all that much, only the archers are lawyers, consultants, and accountants\u2014and the fortress, the state itself.",
      "The desire to carve out exceptions is not new: communities have always set places apart for the purpose of contemplation, ritual, and worship. The Celts called these \"thin places,\" where the distance between heaven and earth was said to be shorter.",
      "Today, our elsewheres and nowheres aren't places of offerings, but places of evasion. They remind us of the newness of our world of bordered, independent states\u2014a mold whose contents began to set only after decolonization\u2014and its vulnerability to more powerful forces.",
      "Capitalists, forever pursuing profit, regard liminal and offshore jurisdictions as frontiers. This book is as much about these modern frontiersmen as it is about their battlegrounds. But theirs is no freewheeling regime of open borders. While the existence of the hidden globe might appear to challenge the myth of the meaningful, unified nation, the nation is too sticky and politically expedient a concept to do away with entirely. In fact, the hidden globe can empower the most xenophobic and exclusionary nationalism. And these policies are not just the domain of the political right. Whether Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, the regimes behind them aim to bring the right people in and keep the wrong ones out.",
      "By enabling nationalist immigration policies, the hidden globe thus circumscribes the lives of the world's most disenfranchised people: there are detainees languishing in offshore prisons in the Caribbean and the Pacific, impoverished workers processing goods for export in duty-free industrial zones across the Global South, sailors and asylum seekers stuck on vessels they cannot leave for lack of papers. When a person can't stay home and is unwanted abroad, they might end up in a third space: neither here nor there. Seeing these spaces for what they are changed the way I saw the world, and I think it will change the way you see it too.",

    "summary": "Federal officials say homelessness rose 18% in 2024, driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing.",
    "story": [
      "Homelessness in the U.S. jumped 18.1% this year, hitting a record level, with the dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in some regions of the country, federal officials said Friday.",
      "More than 770,000 people were counted as homeless in federally required tallies taken across the country during a single night in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in its new report.\u00a0The estimate likely undercounts the number of unhoused people given that it doesn't include people staying with friends or family because they don't have a place of their own.",
      "That jump comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time.",
      "Vulnerable Americans have been hard hit during the post-pandemic years as many government supports ended, including the eviction moratorium. At the same time, housing costs are surging, causing a record number of renters to be cost-burdened, or paying more than 30% of their income on housing,\u00a0according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.",
      "\"More people than ever need help paying rent. More people than ever are becoming homeless for the first time,\" the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit focused on preventing and ending homelessness, wrote on X in a post about the HUD report.",
      "The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population.",
      "\"No American should face homelessness,\" HUD Agency head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on \"evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\"",
      "However, because the report is based on data collected almost a year earlier, it may not accurately represent current circumstances, the statement added. For instance, unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have declined this year, after migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under President Joe Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December 2024.",
      "A rise in family homelessness",
      "Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness \u2014 one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities.",
      "Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year.",
      "Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count.",
      "\"Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,\" Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. \"As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.\"",
      "Bans on camping",
      "The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness.",
      "Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities \u2014 especially in Western states \u2014 have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don't violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness.",
      "There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024.",
      "\"The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,\" Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. \"With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide. Federal investments are critical in tackling the country's housing affordability crisis and ensuring that every American has access to safe, stable housing.\"",
      "Cities where homelessness is declining",
      "Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023.",
      "California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts.",
      "The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade.",
      "Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017.",

      "A board member of Citigroup and its predecessor, Citibank, since 1996, Parsons was named chairman in 2009 at a time of turmoil for the financial institution.

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:56:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, requires some businesses to register with FINCEN next month, or face fines. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "An anti-money laundering law called the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, is now back in action after a Dec. 23 court ruling that will require millions of small business owners to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by mid-January, or potentially pay fines of up to $10,000.",
      "The registration rule had been on hold since Dec. 3, when a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. But on Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the order, ruling that the decision is in the \"public's urgent interest in combating financial crime and protecting our country's national security.\"",
      "The CTA requires that the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address, by Jan. 1. With the court ruling that enforcement can proceed, many small business owners may scramble to register ahead of deadline, although FinCEN said on Dec. 23 that it is extending the deadline until Jan. 13 due to the late December court ruling.",
      "\"Reporting companies that were created or registered prior to Jan. 1, 2024 have until Jan. 13, 2025 to file their initial beneficial ownership information reports with FinCEN,\" the agency said in a statement. \"These companies would otherwise have been required to report by Jan. 1, 2025.\"",
      "Some business associations say the extension still doesn't give business owners enough time to meet the deadline.",
      "\"We are greatly concerned that a mere two-week extension does not provide enough time for millions of American businesses to comply with the law,\" Mark Eisele, president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a Dec. 24 letter. \"At minimum, we request Treasury provide a one-year delay to allow for greater education and outreach to small businesses across rural America.\"",
      "And some civil liberties groups decried the ruling, saying that the regulation represents governmental overreach.",
      "\"The government cannot be allowed to maintain this unconstitutional statute, which stretches beyond Congress's proper authority to regulate Americans,\" said the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a civil rights group, said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, a FinCEN spokesperson said the appeals court ruling \"underscores the importance and urgency of the Corporate Transparency Act for national security.\"",
      "\"The Corporate Transparency Act levels the playing field for tens of millions of law-abiding small businesses across the United States and makes it harder for bad actors to exploit loopholes in order to gain an unfair advantage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Here's what to know about the ruling and the CTA.",
      "What is the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA?",
      "The CTA, an anti-money laundering statute passed in 2021, was intended to get a look inside shell companies and crack down on attempts by \"criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in 2022.",
      "The rules first became effective in 2024, but gave existing businesses until Jan.1, 2025, to register, while businesses that began this year have 90 days to register.",
      "FinCEN is a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that investigates money laundering and other illegal financial activities.",
      "What is the CTA's beneficial ownership information rule, or BOI?",
      "The reporting rule is the CTA's Beneficial Ownership Information reporting requirement, or BOI, which mandates small businesses to register the following with FinCEN, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Your company's full legal name.Its business address (P.O. boxes or lawyers' offices aren't accepted, the Chamber of Commerce says).\u00a0The state where the company was formed or first registered.A\u00a0taxpayer identification number\u00a0and an identity document, such as a filed Articles of Incorporation.Beneficial owners' full legal names and birth dates.Beneficial owners' home addresses.A photocopy of beneficial owners' U.S. driver's license or passport.",

      "Here are other filing deadlines, depending on the date of a business' creation.",
      "Companies created on or after September 4, 2024 that had a filing deadline between December 3, 2024 and December 23, 2024 now have until January 13, 2025 to file with FinCEN.Businesses created or registered in the U.S. on or after Dec. 3, 2024 and on or before Dec. 23, 2024 have an extra 21 days from their original deadline to file with FinCEN.Those businesses that qualify for disaster relief may be have deadlines later than Jan. 13.

      "Businesses may also face criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, the Chamber of Commerce notes.",
      "Which businesses are exempt from the CTA filing?",
      "There are 23 types of businesses that are exempt from the beneficial ownership information filing, according to the Chamber of Commerce. These include many publicly traded companies and nonprofits, as well as some large operating companies.",
      "Many types of banks and other financial services businesses don't need to file, according to FinCEN. Some other types of businesses, such as many sole proprietorships, are also exempt, it noted. (A list and Q&A on exemptions can be seen here.)",
      "What may happen next in the CTA case?",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Dec 2024 19:43:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Toy stores and the toy industry are warning that Trump's pledge to add tariffs to Chinese imports could harm their businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is pledging to slap new tariffs on imports after he's inaugurated next month \u2014 a vow that's prompting the toy industry to warn about the impact.",
      "Even if toys are designed in Europe or the U.S., they are frequently manufactured in China, a nation whose exports Trump last month threatened to target with a new 10% tariff as soon as he takes office. On the campaign trail, he floated the idea of a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Nearly 80% of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, according to The Toy Association, an industry group.",
      "If Trump carries through with his tariff plan, toy prices would rise \"probably instantly,\" Jennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City's West Side Kids told CBS News. She estimates that about 90% of the toys she sells are made in China.",
      "To be sure, the toy industry isn't alone in fretting about the impact of Trump's promised tariffs, as higher prices on a broad range of imports would likely be passed onto consumers. After more than four decades serving the neighborhood, Bergman fears that higher prices may threaten her shop's survival and impact her customers.",
      "\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can't really imagine not being here.\"",
      "If Trump follows through on his tariff plans, American consumers stand to lose as much as $78 billion in spending power annually on products, including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released last month.",
      "The toy industry is also sounding the alarm, with the Toy Association calling the potential tariffs \"significantly harmful\" and urging its members to contact their Congressional delegates to express their concern.",
      "Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, but rather than being paid by the exporting country or company, the levy is paid by the importer \u2014 and much of that is handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"A tariff of 60% on China would be a major shock to international goods markets,\" experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a Dec. 12 blog post.",
      "The toy industry would be one of the U.S. industries facing the worst impacts because China is the dominant supplier to the U.S., they added.",
      "\"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they noted.",
      "Still, some economists say Trump could use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining tool, without actually implementing the import duties. And tariffs could also encourage more U.S. manufacturing of toys and other products, although that would likely take time for new factories to ramp up.",

      "\"We are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\" Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday release. \"This cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\"",
      "Can pets transmit bird flu to owners?",
      "Oregon officials are monitoring household members who had contact with the cat to see if they develop any flu symptoms, but no human cases of bird flu were identified as of Tuesday and the risk of transmission to humans remains low in the state.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it's unlikely for a pet owner to get sick with bird flu through direct contact with an infected pet, but it is possible. The health agency noted that in 2016, the spread of bird flu from a cat to a person was reported in New York City. The infected individual, a veterinarian, had mild flu symptoms after prolonged exposure to sick cats without using personal protective equipment.",
      "Oregon's Department of Agriculture said the cat death is a reminder that giving raw meat products to pets can lead to illness.",

      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",
      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",
      "The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \"used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\" to workers. That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 21:37:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The court roundly rejected claims by Trump that the judge who presided over the trial erred in a series of decisions.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is not entitled to a new trial in the case in which a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation of the writer E. Jean Carroll, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.",
      "The court roundly rejected claims by Trump and his lawyers that the judge who presided over the trial made a series of decisions that harmed Trump's standing with the jury.",
      "Trump asked for a new trial after a jury unanimously concluded in May 2023 that a preponderance of evidence supported Carroll's claim that Trump sexually abused her during a mid-1990s encounter in a New York City department store. Monday's 77-page decision rejected complaints made repeatedly by Trump before, during and after the nine-day trial.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, based in New York, found that District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan did not err in allowing the testimonies of two women who made claims on the stand of alleged encounters with Trump that bore similarities to Carroll's.",
      "\"With his shoulder and the whole weight of his body against her, Mr. Trump held her against the wall, kissed her, pulled down her tights, and stuck his fingers into her vagina \u2014 until Ms. Carroll managed to get a knee up and push him back off of her,\" the appeals court wrote, summarizing evidence and testimony of Carroll's claim.",
      "Carroll said she and Trump bumped into each other by chance while shopping at Bergdorf Goodman. What started as a pleasant walk through the store \u2014 her helping him choose a present for another woman, as they engaged in jocular banter \u2014 turned violent in a changing room, she alleged.",
      "Trump has vehemently denied Carroll's allegations, and vowed to appeal the case as far as the Supreme Court. He has also appealed a January 2024 trial ruling that found him liable for more defamation against Carroll. That appeal is still pending. The juries in the two cases combined awarded Carroll more than $88 million.",
      "Attorneys for Trump did not immediately reply to a request for comment. A spokesman for Trump, Steven Cheung, said he plans to appeal, and said Americans who voted for Trump demand \"a swift dismissal of all the Witch Hunts.\"",
      "Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, thanked the appeals court for \"its careful consideration of the parties' arguments,\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision,\" said Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge.",
      "Among Trump's complaints about the trial was that the jurors were shown an outtake from \"Access Hollywood,\" in which Trump could be heard describing grabbing women's genitals. The clip was widely shared during the 2016 presidential race. The court found that Lewis Kaplan did not err in allowing that video to be shown.",
      "Carroll's federal civil lawsuit made claims of rape, sexual abuse and defamation as defined by New York's penal code. The jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, but rejected the rape claim, which under New York's statute requires proof of forceful penetration involving the attacker's genitals.",
      "The judge later wrote that New York's penal code is out of touch with federal standards and a \"modern\" understanding of what rape is. In post-trial rulings he wrote that Carroll's assertion that Trump raped her was \"substantially true.\"",
      "\"The definition of rape in the New York Penal Law is far narrower than the meaning of 'rape' in common modern parlance, its definition in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes, and elsewhere,\" Lewis Kaplan wrote in July 2023",
      "The jury \"implicitly found Mr. Trump did in fact digitally rape Ms. Carroll,\" Lewis Kaplan wrote.",

      "While Carter had his share of accomplishments as president, his time in the White House, from 1977 to 1981, was tumultuous. His one term in office included the U.S. energy shortage and the Iran hostage crisis.",
      "Carter rose on the national stage after Watergate, at a time when voters were looking for a change in politics.",
      "\"They didn't want Ed Muskie or Hubert Humphrey or Scoop Jackson or George Wallace,\" Brinkley said. \"They were tired of those people that had been in the national spotlight for so long. So, he came at America as a fresh new face.\"",
      "James Earl Carter Jr. was born on Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains. The son of a peanut farmer, he loved books and his Baptist faith.",
      "At the U.S. Naval Academy, he studied nuclear science and graduated with distinction in 1946. That same year, he married a young woman named Rosalynn Smith \u2014 a marriage that would last for more than seven decades. They celebrated their 77th anniversary on July 7, 2023, the longest-married presidential couple in American history.\u00a0She died months later, on Nov. 19, 2023, at age 96.",
      "Carter completed submarine training and served in the Navy for seven years before moving home to Georgia to run the family peanut farm. He and Rosalynn raised four children while his career focus shifted from farming to politics.",
      "After eight years in state offices, Carter, a Democrat, was elected governor of Georgia in 1970. It was clear he was a new kind of Southern leader, one who emphasized racial equality and traditional values, at a time when the nation was in need of stability.",
      "In 1976 \u2014 America's bicentennial year \u2014 he defeated President Gerald Ford to become the 39th president of the United States. The Carters conveyed that they were of the people when they marched in the open air on the inaugural parade route.",
      "\"His greatest asset as a candidate was his outsider status,\" Brinkley said. \"And his greatest failing as a president was the fact that he remained an outsider, when you must be an insider in Washington if you're going to be an effective president.\"",
      "He struggled to cultivate relationships in Washington and feuded openly with Democratic leaders in Congress. As oil prices and inflation soared, his popularity sank.",
      "But there were accomplishments along the way. Carter created the departments of Energy and Education. He established formal diplomatic ties with China and returned control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanians.",
      "Perhaps his greatest achievement was a historic peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, known as the Camp David Accords.",
      "\"Let history record that deep and ancient antagonism can be settled without bloodshed and without a staggering waste of precious lives,\" Carter said at the signing of the peace treaty on March 26, 1979.",
      "On Nov. 4, 1979, Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 Americans hostage. A U.S. military attempt to free them ended in disaster, with eight American servicemen killed in a crash. The crisis dominated Carter's reelection campaign, while the economy continued to struggle and inflation topped 18%.",
      "In the final days of his administration, the president and his team negotiated freedom for the hostages. They were released on Ronald Reagan's Inauguration Day.",
      "In the years after leaving the White House, the Carters established The Carter Center in Atlanta, with a mission to work toward advancing peace and global health.",
      "\"We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace. We can make these changes \u2014 and we must,\" he said in 2002 as he formally accepted the Nobel Peace Prize for his decades of humanitarian work.",
      "He and Rosalynn built houses with Habitat for Humanity, dedicating their efforts to the group for more than 30 years, and he penned more than 20 books.",
      "He sparked controversy with his 2006 book \"Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,\" in which he characterized Israel's treatment of Palestinians as oppression. He later issued an open apology to the Jewish community, saying that suggestions for improvement should not stigmatize Israel.",
      "In 2007, Carter spoke at the funeral of his former political rival turned close friend and confidante, former President Ford.",
      "\"One of my proudest moments was at the commemoration of the 200th birthday of the White House, when two noted historians both declared that the Ford-Carter friendship was the most intensely personal between any two presidents in history,\" Carter said.",
      "Carter announced in August 2015 that he had been diagnosed with cancer, a form of melanoma that had spread to his liver and his brain. Though he curtailed his activities with The Carter Center, he continued to fundraise for the organization, and also continued teaching Sunday school classes in Plains, a tradition he started in his teens.",
      "Carter was treated with a new immunotherapy drug and made a remarkable recovery, sharing the news six months later that an MRI showed no signs of cancer.",
      "In May 2019, he suffered another health setback, falling and breaking his hip. He went home from the hospital to recover and was soon back to teaching his Sunday school class. Carter suffered two more falls in October 2019 and was hospitalized for a fractured pelvis. A month later, he was admitted to a hospital in Atlanta for a surgical procedure to relieve pressure on his brain.",
      "The Carter Center said in May 2023 that Rosalynn had been diagnosed with dementia; she continued to live at home with her husband until her death that November.",
      "They are survived by their four children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",
      "During his many years after the White House, Carter planted seeds of peace, and sometimes seeds of controversy. But as one of the most active former presidents in history, many believe he defined the role for those who would follow.",

      "Others were likely there because of what President Carter accomplished in the longest, and most impactful, post-presidency in American history \u2013 monitoring more than 100 elections around the world; helping virtually eliminate Guinea worm disease, an infection that had haunted Africa for centuries; becoming the only former president to earn a Nobel Peace Prize; and building or repairing thousands of homes in more than a dozen countries with his beloved Rosalynn as part of Habitat for Humanity.",

He believed some things were more important than reelection \u2014 things like integrity, respect, and compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God's image.",

And in doing so, he taught all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service. In his Nobel acceptance speech, President Carter said, 'God gives us the capacity for choice. We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace.'

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 23:11:16 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I feel like we should've learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" Dr. Leana Wen said.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Leana Wen said Sunday that the lack of testing for bird flu doesn't mean that the virus isn't alive in humans, and that she feels the federal government \"should have learned our lesson from COVID\" and should be proactive in making tests available for Americans \u2014 and not wait for labs to characterize the cases and their severity.",
      "\"I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not,\" she added.",
      "The recent outbreak of bird flu stems from a mutation of the H5N1 virus that affects humans more easily, compared to past mutations of the virus that targeted birds and not mammals.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC reported its first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. found in a patient in Louisiana who was infected from a backyard poultry flock. The Louisiana case was first confirmed by health officials Friday, adding to the total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. Another severe case of H5N1 has been reported in a teen in British Columbia.",
      "According to the CDC, the mutations found in humans seemed to develop as the virus adapted to its host. The genetic changes in the H5N1 samples from the infected human were not present in the samples from the backyard poultry flock that infected the patient, suggesting that the concerning mutations had not developed until after the transmission of the virus. Federal health officials in the report said that spread between close contacts is more likely when these changes develop during the clinical course of a human infection.",
      "\"It's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors,\" Wen said\u00a0 Sunday, adding that this mutation allows a person to have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "Wen added that she believes the number of H5N1 cases currently reported in the U.S. is likely an undercount due to the lack of testing.",
      "\"We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states; 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing,\" Wen said.",
      "Wen on Sunday also urged the Biden administration to approve the H5N1 vaccine, which is already developed and contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses but awaits FDA authorization \u2013 a key difference from the beginning stages of COVID.",
      "\"There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people,\" Wen said. \"I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility.\"",
      "The push for immediate authorization of vaccines and additional testing is rooted in concern that the Trump administration could potentially delay vaccines.",
      "\"I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence,\" Wen said. \"Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID.\"",
      "Some of President-elect Trump's cabinet picks like Dr. Marty Makary, who is set to lead the FDA, Wen described as \"very competent\" and an \"independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.\" There is more concern, however, over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services,\" Wen said.\u00a0 \"Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti-vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades.\"",

      "President Biden on Sunday evening praised the late\u00a0President Jimmy Carter\u00a0as an example of \"simple decency\" in remarks hours after Carter's death at the age of 100 was announced.",
      "The president, in a brief warm tribute, emphasized Carter's humanity, saying that he had \"lived a life measured not by words, but by his deeds.\"",
      "Carter, the 39th president and the longest-living president in U.S. history, died Sunday at home in Plains, Georgia, surrounded by family.",
      "Recalling that Carter kept teaching Sunday school at the Baptist church in Plains long after his presidency, Mr. Biden, who is vacationing in St. Croix, told reporters, \"In today's world, some look at Jimmy Carter and see a man of a bygone era \u2014 with honesty and character, faith and humility. It mattered. But I don't believe it's a bygone era. I see man not only of our time, but for all times.\"",
      "\"We would all do well to be a little more like Jimmy Carter,\" the president said.",
      "Mr. Biden said what Carter represented was \"an example of ... simple decency.\" The president, who had a relationship with Carter that spanned over six decades, recalled that he was the first sitting senator to endorse Carter's 1976 presidential bid. He said, \"I told him why I was endorsing \u2014 that it was not only his policies, but his character, his decency, the honor he communicates.\"",
      "Though Carter was a governor from the South, and Mr. Biden was raised in the Northeast, the two one-term presidents had in common a strong affinity with working-class Americans. One of the things the president said he most admired about Carter was the belief they shared that \"everybody deserves an even shot.\"",
      "The president praised Carter's exemplary post-presidency \u2014 he worked for decades to eradicate disease not only at home, but also abroad, and also sought to \"enforce peace, advance civil rights, human rights, free and fair elections around the world,\" and to help with his own hands to build housing for the homeless.",
      "Carter, Mr. Biden said, \"stands as a model what it means to live a life of meaning and purpose, a life of principle, faith and humility.\"",
      "Mr. Biden also expressed admiration for Carter's own long fight against his cancer after his diagnosis nine years ago.",
      "\"Jimmy Carter was just as courageous in his battle against cancer as he was in everything in his life,\" the president said. \"Cancer is a common link between our two families,\" he added, noting that when his son Beau Biden died, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter \"helped us heal.\"",
      "\"He lost his father, his brother, his sisters, to this terrible disease,\" Mr. Biden said. He added that when Carter himself was diagnosed with cancer, \"we did our best to comfort him.\"",
      "At the end of his remarks, asked what President-elect Donald Trump should take from Carter's example, the president responded, \"Decency. Decency. Decency. Everybody deserves a shot. Everybody.\"",
      "He added, \"Can you imagine Jimmy Carter walking by someone that needs something and he just keeps walking? Can you imagine Jimmy Carter referring to someone by the way they look or where they talk? I can't. I can't.\" He added that one of the reasons the world looks to the U.S. as an example is \"we've laid out what our values are, we said we would believe.\"",
      "\"It's not just in the Declaration (of Independence that) 'we hold these truths to be self evident,' but it is a feeling,\" Mr. Biden said. The world \"looks to us, and he was worth looking to,\" he said of Carter.",

    "summary": "After a single term in office, Jimmy Carter's decades of humanitarian work may be his most enduring legacy.",
    "story": [
      "Elected in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia, ran as a Washington outsider and rose to the White House with a strong sense of morality, an engineer's mind and a progressive, moderate approach to governing.",
      "Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100, after going into hospice care\u00a0in February 2023 at his home in Plains, Georgia, served only a single term in office but devoted the decades that followed to bettering the lives of countless people across the U.S. and around the world.",
      "He faced massive crises during his presidency \u2014 sky-high oil prices, double-digit interest rates and inflation, and the Iran hostage crisis \u2014 and his failure to effectively address them resulted in his failure to win reelection in 1980. He also had some major accomplishments, including the negotiation of a peace deal between Egypt and Israel.",
      "But it is his widely lauded post-presidency, characterized by tireless peace and humanitarian efforts, that is likely to be his most enduring legacy.",
      "After leaving office in 1981, Carter became an important diplomatic figure, securing the release of political prisoners in Nicaragua in 1986 and of American Aijalon Gomes from North Korea in 2010. He served as a negotiator with North Korea during the Clinton administration, and even offered his services to then-President Trump in talks with North Korea.",
      "Along with his wife, Rosalynn Carter \u2014 who died at age 96 on Nov. 19, 2023 \u2014   he founded the Carter Center in 1982, a nonprofit human rights organization that took on as its broad mission the alleviation of human suffering. Through the work of the Carter Center, he devoted himself to preventing and resolving global conflicts, promoting freedom and democracy, and improving the health of millions of people around the world.",
      "Among other initiatives, the Carter Center oversaw efforts to conduct free and fair elections in dozens of countries in the developing world, and helped lead global efforts to eliminate Guinea worm disease, which spread through unfiltered drinking water and once sickened millions across Africa.",
      "Carter was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work in advancing democracy and human rights through the Carter Center.",
      "\"We have transformed the lives of, I would say, millions of people, primarily in the poorest and most destitute and forgotten communities in the world,\" he told CBS News' Rita Braver in a 2006 interview.",
      "The Carters also worked for decades with Habitat for Humanity to build homes for those in need. Carter first became involved in 1984 and remained active building homes with the organization for decades. The day after he fell in his Plains, Georgia, home in October 2019, leaving him with a black eye and stitches at the age of 95, Carter still traveled to Tennessee to volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.",
      "He and Rosalynn sponsored the Carter Work Project at Habitat for Humanity for over 30 years. According to the organization, the Carters have worked \"alongside 104,000 volunteers in 14 countries to build, renovate and repair 4,390 homes.\"",
      "A devout Christian, the former president also made an impact in his local community as a teacher. He taught Sunday School at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains until nearly the end of his life. He also taught at Emory University in Atlanta for nearly 40 years.",
      "Carter acknowledged that his post-presidential activities had earned him higher regard than he'd experienced in office.",
      "\"Certainly my reputation has been better in the post-presidential years than maybe in the White House,\" he said in that 2006 interview. \"But I think that when people look at back on what we did in the White House, I think there's a lot there of justifiable pride.\"",
      "Throughout his post-presidency, he was never afraid to speak out when troubled by policies of those who succeeded him in the White House. He was an early and vocal critic of the war in Iraq begun under President George W. Bush, and he opposed the Obama administration's use of drone strikes to target suspected terrorists.",
      "He criticized Trump for \"exacerbating\" racial tensions and being \"careless with the truth,\" telling CBS News' John Dickerson in 2018, \"I think I went through my campaign and my presidency without ever lying to the people or making a deliberately false statement, and I think that would be a very worthwhile thing to reinsert into politics these days.\" He added that he wished Trump well \"and I pray for him.\"",
      "Carter joined fellow past presidents in condemning the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and he marked the date one year later by writing: \"I now fear that what we have fought so hard to achieve globally \u2014 the right to free, fair elections, unhindered by strongman politicians who seek nothing more than to grow their own power \u2014 has become dangerously fragile at home. \u2026 For American democracy to endure, we must demand that our leaders and candidates uphold the ideals of freedom and adhere to high standards of conduct.\"",
      "Carter wrote 33 books, including memoirs about his life and career, as well as books on other topics like faith and aging.",
      "He and Rosalynn Carter were married for 77 years, and were known for their devotion to one another. They are survived by their four children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",

      "I'm Major Garrett, in for Margaret Brennan.",
      "As we close out 2024, we, of course, want to look ahead to the economy, health care, immigration, so much more, as Washington ushers in a new Congress and, importantly, a new administration.",
      "We begin with a Face the Nation tradition, our year-end correspondents roundtable.",
      "Joining us, chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane, chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa, political correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns, and senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe.",
      "It is great to have you all with us.",
      "Scott MacFarlane, I want to start with you.",
      "The new Congress will be sworn in this week. What position does Mike Johnson, the current speaker of the House, find himself in seeking reelection to that position?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It's a tenuous position. It has the prospect and promise of having high drama Friday, when they begin the new Congress January 3 by choosing the new speaker.",
      "One of the most underappreciated and underreported issues of the 2024 election was this incredibly narrow margin Republicans preserved in the U.S. House, even more narrow than the one that gridlocked them over the past two years.",
      "And, of course, the first order of business is choosing a speaker. Republicans have just one or two votes to spare on anything. That has the possibility of paralyzing things. And we saw two years ago the speaker vote was like a \u2013 it's like Gilligan's Island. It was supposed to be a three- hour vote and ended up being a multi-arc drama with many divergent characters, not including Thurston Howell.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: But here's the thing. It's just the top layer of this very treacherous cake for them is picking a speaker, because, what does this next speaker have to concede to win that post?",
      "We saw over the last two years the prior speaker had to concede positions on the pivotal Rules Committee to some contrarian voices in the Rules Committees, where bills went to die, instead of to get set up for a vote. And that's why so many Democratic votes were needed for so many pivotal things, because the Rules Committee was jammed up by contrarians.",
      "That could happen again.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa, I want to turn to you, because, if he were so inclined, president-elect Trump could clarify his preference here. And that would send an important signal to those Republicans in the House majority to be still on the fence about this, yet he remains conspicuously silent.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: That decision is reflective of the dynamic right now down at Mar-a-Lago, the president's retreat in Florida.",
      "There is high drama, as Scott reports, on Capitol Hill. But, in Trump's inner circle, it's almost like the low-key second season of a TV show. That's how it's been described to me by allies of president-elect Trump. He's being guided by Susie Wiles, his incoming chief of staff.",
      "And she's created, I'm told, this atmosphere of calm when it comes to some of the nominees, the process, laying out the agenda for next year, top of the agenda, tax cuts, trying to expand those Trump tax cuts from 2017, of course, mass deportations also part of Trump's plan, a border bill as well.",
      "And you do have controversial nominees in Kash Patel for the FBI, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services, among others. But, at its core, you have a president-elect who's now comfortable with power, comfortable with the people around him.",
      "This is so different, Major, than what we saw in 2016, when we were covering that transition period. It had this theatrical element, Trump welcoming people to Bedminster for these showy appearances and interviews.",
      "Now we rarely see the president-elect. He's firing off missives at times on TRUTH Social, his platform, but he's often behind the scenes getting ready for 2025, because he's been here before. He knows what he wants to do.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Ed O'Keefe, President Biden remains president of the United States, though some Americans might have to be reminded of that fact.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What is ahead for the president in the waning days of his presidency in terms of travel and possible pardons?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, he is taking one final foreign trip, and it was one that we \u2013 those of us who followed him a long time anticipated might happen. And that is a trip to the Vatican to see the pope and then to see the Italian leadership as well.",
      "They have been in far closer contact than I think many people appreciate, because the pope, like the president, shares a lot of the concerns about the state of the world, about what's going on in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Conflict, climate change.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Absolutely, yes, and state of democracy and just general concern for social justice, which is\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Refugee flows, exactly.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes, exactly.",
      "And so that will be a critical political meeting, but also a real personal capstone for the second Catholic president.",
      "And it speaks as well to one of the things he's been focused on over the last several weeks and will continue to be. We're still waiting to hear more about, for example, pardons and clemency. Will there be more of those? And will they be for the everyman? Or will they be for notable political figures like, for example, Jesse Jackson Jr., the former congressman from Illinois, or others who've ended up in the legal system and maybe are well- known and are now appealing for some kind of leniency or forgiveness?",
      "And so those 37 death row clemencies that we saw before Christmas, a good example of what's to come and what he's eager to do, and also a good example of what little he can do, because, of course, Congress has no interest in working with him. They can't even really sort out what to do with themselves, but \u2013 so he's using the executive privileges that he has in these waning weeks.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jan, as you know better than anyone at this table, this last year was a clash of law and politics, unlike anything we have seen in our modern American history.",
      "The judicial system in our country, according to Gallup, 35 percent confidence, 20 percent below our peer countries, other free market democracies. How much of that is a reflection of this clash, the Supreme Court, or just a sense that our judicial system has become, in the words of someone we have all come to know, two-tiered?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: You know, that's a hard question to answer, because I think you have got a\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We always give you the easiest ones, Jan.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: But I'm going to try, Major, because I think it goes \u2013 you have got to look past just this past year and go further back.",
      "I think it really started and took off in the wake of the Dobbs decision, the court's ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. The outrage over that decision was so extreme that you saw, I think, a quite calculated effort to undermine legitimacy of the Supreme Court by Democrats, Senate Democrats, for example, hearings, stories about scandals, some of which were pretty overblown, to say the least.",
      "So, that has an impact on public opinion. The public starts to believe that this court is corrupt, that this is \u2013 it's on the take, none of which is true. I mean, this is still a court. You may disagree with their decisions. It's a very conservative court. It is not a corrupt court.",
      "These are nine justices who have very different views on how to interpret the Constitution who are kind of in this Titanic struggle over law, not politics.",
      "Even the immunity decision, I mean, that decision was so misreported to say that the court was going to save Trump from a criminal trial. No, it wasn't. That was never the decision. In fact, that decision is going to help protect Joe Biden from any future prosecution by Donald Trump if he wanted to do that.",
      "So, when we look at public opinion polls, sure, the court's taken a hit, but that's true over the years. The court often takes a hit. So do other institutions. And the court's opinion \u2013 court's public opinion remains much higher than our other institutions, including the White House, Congress, and by far the news media.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Congress at 17 percent, according to Gallup.",
      "Caitlin, Jan mentioned the Dobbs decision. One of the things that roiled through the political calendar year of 2024 was how important, how impactful would that decision be on turnout and the ultimate outcome of the election?",
      "But, as you traveled the country, you kept telling us, yes, it's an important issue, but there are other things on the minds of women voters in this country.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Yes, we always say that voters have the capacity to think about a lot of different things at once.",
      "And we saw, in the wake of that decision in the midterms, that was top of mind for people. It was the first way to kind of exercise their views across the country on this issue. But, this time around, voters had different ways to express their feelings about the Dobbs decision.",
      "Many of them had ballot measures in their states, a couple of those states being battleground states, that they could vote for codifying abortion rights into their state law and also vote for Donald Trump, because they believed in his views on the economy, on immigration, or at least that he could solve some of their concerns about them.",
      "And as I spoke to women across the country, as we all spent the whole year talking to voters and really listening to voters, a lot of women talked to me about how concerned they were about safety, about the economy, a lot of them responsible for their family's budgets, paying the bills, going to the grocery store, these kinds of fundamental things.",
      "And, also, it was kind of a reminder that we have been treating women as kind of a monolithic group in the wake of Dobbs. And this election showed that it's not as such, that they do care a lot about safety, the economy. Those were overarching issues, but they also do care about women's rights, abortion rights, but they just had other avenues to express that.",
      "And that's really what helped. And Donald Trump also modified his positions, at least to satisfy some of those voters, at least that I spoke to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert, Caitlin brought up women's concerns about security. That flows through immigration.",
      "I wonder what your perspective is on this online feud that's gone on, on for the last three or four days between parts of the MAGA universe over H- 1B visas, which are essentially visas set aside for high-skilled laborers, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and nominally president-elect Trump on the side of that, hard right nativist parts of the MAGA movement using expletives on social media typically reserved for their political foes, not for those in the MAGA tent, assailing one another.",
      "What do you make of all of that?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: The coalition that lifted Donald Trump back to power included Silicon Valley executives. Elon Musk, Trump inner circle members say, deserves a lot of credit for pouring a lot of money in the final months into the campaign.",
      "But at the end of the day, this was a campaign where so many voters at rally after rally we covered were holding up signs that said \"Mass Deportations Now.\" The message was obvious, it was in your face.",
      "And for \u2013 the idea that president-elect Trump is going to back away from his immigration position because of some whisper in his ear from a Silicon Valley billionaire, it's just not happening, based on my reporting.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And, Scott, very quickly, do you think that \u2013 we have got about 30 seconds before we need to go to break. How much do you think that will be a part of the early congressional conversation?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I think this battle over the debt limit which Elon Musk weighed in on is going to be the first throw-down of 2025 and impact the first year of Trump's term, because they're going to need Democratic votes to raise the debt ceiling.",
      "That won't satisfy the Elon Musks of the world. I'm not sure how Trump circumvents Democratic concessions for the debt ceiling.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When we come back, you know it, you love it, predictions, biggest story, things that were undercovered with our outstanding correspondents panel.",
      "We will be back in just one moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation and our correspondents roundtable.",
      "Predictions.",
      "Caitlin Huey-Burns.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: I think the biggest story to watch this coming year is how the president-elect when he becomes president handles immigration.",
      "We talked a lot about how the economy was the overarching theme of this election. Immigration is what Trump made his not only closing \u2013 closing argument on, but his entire campaign was really rooted in immigration.",
      "So what this looks like, we saw in our polling majority support for mass deportations. What does that actually look like? And how do they handle that once we see what that looks like on television, how they have people explaining their policy, and what those stories look like because of that, and whether the base is satisfied and whether the general public gets what they voted for on that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jan, 2025 prediction.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I will go back to the court.",
      "I think that Donald Trump will probably get his fourth nomination to the Supreme Court either this year or maybe next year, when\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Because someone retires.",
      "Who?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Justice Sam Alito.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Justice Sam Alito.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: He was nominated, took the bench in 2006, after nearly two decades on the court.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Most importantly, Marcus Freeman and the Fighting Irish will win the Sugar Bowl on January 1.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Now, this is normally my prediction with Alabama.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: I'm stepping into your territory. But\u2026",

      "Ed, when we first met over a decade ago, we were covering crisis on Capitol Hill. Crisis persists. Such a handful \u2013 and Caitlin Huey-Burns as well. And Scott was there as well.",
      "Look, they only have a handful of seats in the House for the Republican majority. They can only do so much, as Scott said, debt limit battle on the horizon, spending fights. Deja vu. That culture of crisis, governing to the brink of discussions is here again.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Ed O'Keefe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I will make the firmer prediction that, based on all that chaos, Speaker Johnson won't be speaker by the end of 2025.",
      "Did that a few years ago on Paul Ryan, and it worked. So, watch out, Speaker Johnson. Nothing personal.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Be careful, Speaker Johnson. Be advised.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But just look at \u2013 look at what faces him.",

      "They're getting thousands of threats a year on their lives, on their families. The travel is exhausting. And we're coming into a relatively polarizing moment with Trump coming back into office. You're going to see a lot of retirements in odd-numbered years, including 2025.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I think that's one reason why you're going to see Justice Alito step down.",

      "JAN CRAWFORD: Unquestioned.",
      "And it's starting to emerge now that his advisers kind of managed his limitations, which has been reported in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" for four years. And yet he insisted that he could still run for president. We should have much more forcefully questioned whether he was fit for office for another four years, which could have led to a primary for the Democrats.",
      "It could have changed the scope of the entire election. Yet still, incredibly, we read in \"The Washington Post\" that his advisers are saying that he regrets that he dropped out of the race, that he thinks he could have beaten Trump. And I think that is either delusional or they're gaslighting the American people.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Caitlin Huey-Burns.",

      "And, in some ways, it turned out to be a benefit with low-propensity voters. And talking to the Trump campaign throughout the cycle and reporting on it, they were making this bet that, if he leaned into his personality and made no qualms about it, made no apologies about it, that would kind of speak to this authenticity factor, this premium that low- propensity voters, those not inclined to participate in elections, might be inclined towards.",
      "It was a big bet. It paid off. And it will remain \u2013 the biggest question I have is whether Republicans can replicate any of that, because so much of their political wins this year are unique to Donald Trump himself.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Last week, the U.S. reported its first severe case of bird flu found in a patient in Louisiana.",
      "For more, we're joined by Dr. Leana Wen. She is the former Baltimore health commissioner.",
      "Dr. Leana Wen, it's great to have you with us.",
      "So, bird flu, is this report out of Louisiana worrisome? And, if so, why?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN (Former Baltimore Health Commissioner): Well, it's one more sign that the drumbeat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat.",
      "So, we've already seen this year that there have been a number of mammalian species close to humans that now have bird flu outbreaks. We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states. Sixteen states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive.",
      "And now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing. So, we really don't know the extent of bird flu that's out there in humans.",
      "But this particular case, it's someone who is severely ill, but not only that. Researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors.",
      "Bird flu has been around for a long time, but it hasn't\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: About 30 years.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yes, exactly.",
      "But it hasn't been a major issue in humans, because while it spreads among birds, it hasn't really spread among mammals. But now there is this mutation. And there's another concern now, Major, too which is that we're in flu season, and it's possible that a single person could have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Something called reassortment\u2026",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right. That's right.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2026 where things change because of one illness becoming another illness through reassortment of a mutated virus.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right.",
      "And so the viruses could exchange genes. You could develop a new hybrid virus. And if you now have a virus that's more contagious and causes more severe disease, that's when it becomes a major threat to humankind.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yes, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.",
      "The first is to get testing out there. I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that, just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there. It just means that we aren't looking for it. We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farmworkers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not.",
      "And the second very important thing is, this is not like the beginning of COVID, where we were dealing with a new virus, we didn't have a vaccine. There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost five million doses of the vaccine.",
      "However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine. There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out so \u2013 and to farmworkers and to vulnerable people.",
      "I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing?",
      "I mean, that's a possibility, and I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available, so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Wen, is bird flu in humans super dangerous?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, the World Health Organization estimates that, in prior outbreaks of the bird flu, that the mortality rate is 52 percent, 52 percent.",
      "However, in the \u2013 in this most recent outbreak, it seems that most cases have been mild, and maybe some people even have asymptomatic infection. But the question is, we don't know what happens when bird flu affects more vulnerable individuals.",
      "People infected so far in the U.S. have been mainly farmworkers, who are working, presumably generally healthy, as opposed to what happens when you get to children, to pregnant women, to older individuals with chronic illnesses.",
      "We don't know how deadly, how dangerous bird flu is going to be for those individuals. And, again, that's one more reason why we don't want it to spread and acquire more mutations.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Thirty seconds.",
      "Norovirus is what you call it. Stomach bug is what I would call it. Numbers are surging. It's the holidays. What should people do to protect themselves?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Wash your hands really well, especially if you're going to buffets. Wash your hands if you're touching commonly touched surfaces before you touch your mouth, before you touch your nose.",
      "Norovirus is the most common foodborne illness here in the U.S. It's very hard to avoid once it's in your family. And, also, don't prepare food if you're having vomiting and diarrhea stomach cramps, because you don't want to spread it to other people.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. We really appreciate it.",
      "We will have more questions for Dr. Wen when we come back, but, first, we're going to take a quick break.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with Dr. Leana Wen and a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Dr. Leana Wen.",
      "Doctor, you talked about vaccines and testing in the context of bird flu and preparations therefore. Vaccines and testings were part of the Covid conversation and the Trump administration, when it was in charge.",
      "What level of concern do you have about some of the people appointed by President-elect Trump to incoming public health positions regarding issues of vaccine, testing, public health, efficacy?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN, (Former Baltimore Health Commissioner): I think that there are some people coming into this administration who are very competent. For example, Dr. Marty Markary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon, we have worked together for the last ten-plus years on issues like hospital medical error (ph). He's an independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.",
      "But I have a lot of concern, and I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti- vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti-vaxing advocates in the country, if not in the world over the last couple of decades.",
      "He's also someone who has made his career from being an activist and not a scientist. And what I mean is that, if you're a scientist, even if you have deeply held convictions, you should be willing to change your mind if there are new facts that are presented.",
      "It's a fact that childhood vaccines are safe and they are lifesaving. A CDC analysis just now found that the childhood vaccination have saved over 1.1 million children's lives over the last 20 years. According to a Lancet (ph) study, childhood vaccines saved 154 million lives globally over the last 50 years. I mean these are facts. And it's very concerning to have someone who doesn't believe in the - in how science works and basic scientific principles to be in charge of our nation's preeminent scientific and medical agencies.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: With that perspective, do you believe it's more imperative than you described earlier for the Biden administration to move forward on bird flu vaccinations and testing?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, that's exactly it, I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence. Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe as we could be having for bird flu the way that we had for Covid.",
      "There's no reason why we should hold off on getting more testing. We need to know how much bird flu there is out there. We need to know if there are new mutations that are being developed. Other countries also need to know so that they can prepare as well.",
      "And I think it's a major problem that in the U.S. we have been holding back on testing and also holding back on getting the vaccines deployed that are already developed.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. Thanking you twice. And a Happy New Year to you.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the economy and what to expect in year 2025. We do so with Bank of America senior economist Aditya Bhave.",
      "Aditya, good morning. It's great to see you.",
      "I've covered a lot of presidential transitions. There's always an assessment by the outgoing president about what kind of economy he's giving to his successor. That's a political conversation. Objectively, what is the economy the incoming Trump administration inheriting?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE (Senior U.S. Economist, Bank of America): Good morning. Thank you for having me.",
      "So, we think the economy has really solid momentum going into next year. You can look at our internal card data, for example, that shows a nice acceleration in spending going into the holidays. You can also look at the TSA on airport traffic, and that looks really strong around the holiday period as well.",
      "You can also think about things via a wider lens. Start in 2022. That was a year in which GDP grew by only 1 percent. CPI inflation peaked at 9 percent. And all of the talk back then was stagflation, when, not if, is a recession going to arrive. Why are workers quiet quitting. And then you look at what happened over the following two years, right. This was quite unexpected and in a very pleasant way. Three percent GDP growth. Inflation coming down. Labor productivity moving up. So, all positives that leave us optimistic going into next year that we can continue to grow above 2 percent, albeit with somewhat sticky inflation.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any larger x factor in 2025 than the scale and scope of promised mass deportations of the Trump administration?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: From a market perspective, I think the two biggest issues will actually be fiscal policy and trade policy. And there's a lot of uncertainty around those as well, just as there is around immigration policy. So, with fiscal policy, you had this conversation in your last segment, right, the majority for Republicans in the House is very, very narrow. So, if they want to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they want to do more fiscal stimulus, which we think will probably eventually get done, they have a very slim margin to work with.",
      "And then with trade policy, we really need to understand, you know, how much of the tariffs that President-elect Trump has threatened are actually going to be implemented versus how much is a negotiating tool, right, so how much is transactional.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And for mass deportations, how much do you fear that could affect the labor market and our country, that is to say put upward pressure on prices because if there is mass deportations and workplace inspections, lots of workers in agriculture, construction, meat processing and other vital industries could be pulled out of those sectors.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So, I think it's - our base (ph) case is that there will be a slowdown in the flow of immigrants, right? It's harder to know what will actually happen around deportations.",
      "From an economic perspective, a worker is also a consumer, so there are some down risks to economic activity if there's a large change in the population, right? That's just math.",
      "In terms of pressures in specific sectors, it's really going to depend on how things play out. Yes, there could be labor shortages in certain sectors, but it's very hard to know at this stage.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Many CEOs I listen to say that they expect the tariffs and regulatory relief to kind of wash themselves out, meaning essentially, you put them together, it's benign on the U.S. economy. Is that your perspective?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I think that's about right. If you look at the four key policy issues that we've been focused on, as I said earlier, trade, fiscal policy, immigration policy and deregulation, we think they'll roughly wash out. But again, the starting point is pretty helpful, right? So, we think that we can continue to grow at around 2 to 2.5 percent this - the coming year, as well as in 2026.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, in reading year-end summaries, \"The Economist,\" \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The Washington Post,\" all in their own way, warned that the stock market may be overvalued, may be to exuberant. Do you share any of those concerns?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I'm not an equity analyst, so it's hard for me to day, to give a specific number. Our equity strategists do think that stocks can continue to run up to around 6,600, 6,700 by the end of the year.",
      "What you can say is that, obviously, there's been a pretty aggressive run- up in tech stocks, but it is not of the same scale that we saw in the late '90s if we're really worried about a similar bubble.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What effect do you believe cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence will play in the global economy in 2025?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So, when it comes to A.I., I think there's two things to be said. The actual impact of A.I. adoption is probably going to show up pretty slowly in the data. So, I don't know that we'll necessarily see that in 2025 or 2026. It might be a story for a few years down the line.",
      "But what has been really impactful already, and probably will be much more impactful in the coming years, is just laying the groundwork for A.I., right? So, if you see the increases in investment in data centers, and you think about what all that requires, right?",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes. We need to -",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: It requires materials. It requires energy supply.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Aditya, we need to go. Pardon - pardon me.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: It requires labor, you - you put - sure. Sure.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, I'm sorry to cut you off. We have a hard break we need to get to.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: In 22 days Donald Trump will be sworn in as the nation's 47th president, only the second to serve two nonconsecutive terms.",
      "For more perspective on the most powerful position in the world, we spoke with David Rubenstein, the co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group. His new book, \"The Highest Calling,\" studies the highs and lows of some of this country's most consequential presidents.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How would you compare, based on your study of the presidency, our unsettled times now to unsettled times past?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN (Co-Founder and Co-Chairman, The Carlyle Group): Well, nothing is as bad as the Civil War, when we had 3 percent of our population killed and the fighting in Washington was so bad that about 60 different times members of Congress hit other members of Congress on the floor of the Congress. So, we're not quite there yet.",
      "Clearly, though, we're going into some uncharted waters because we have a president coming back who had been president before. That hadn't happened since Grover Cleveland was re-elected in 1892. And Trump has got more power than I think many people would have thought by the virtue of his victory size. And I do think he's going to act like he's got a mandate and Washington is bracing for what's going to happen.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Related to that, before the election results were known, polls indicated pretty consistently that Trump supporters were afraid if Harris would win, Harris supporters were afraid if Trump would win.",
      "Based on your study of this institution, the presidency, can you recall a time where that fear of an outcome was as prevalent as it was leading into this election?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, there have been a couple times when people really were afraid that the next person coming in that was the opposite party would really hurt the country in many ways. Clearly, my former boss, Jimmy Carter, really feared Ronald Reagan. He thought that Ronald Reagan was going to do - undo many of the things that Carter had done. Obviously, Reagan won by a landslide.",
      "And you've seen other times when this has happened as well. So, for example, when FDR won the first time, Herbert Hoover could not believe that this man, Herbert Hoover, had been such a distinguished American before he was president, and while he was president he had problems, but he was a very distinguished person. He never took FDR seriously. And FDR didn't really take Hoover that seriously. He refused to really meet with him, essentially, or met with him briefly and they just didn't want anything to do with him - each other.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned Grover Cleveland. There's not a chapter in the book about Grover Cleveland. Is there anything that retroactively fascinates you about the Cleveland presidency now that Trump has returned to office, or are you similarly fascinated by the time in which he was president, the Gilded Age?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Grover Cleveland was a Democrat, a former governor of New York, very well respected, but he lost the election in 1888, and he came back in 1892. Now, one of the things we don't really know is whether a president, when he has a second term after he's been out of office, whether he'll be fresher, whether he'll bring better people in, whether he'll be more experienced.",
      "For example, Grover Cleveland's second term was reasonably successful. And, you know, maybe Trump's will be as well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things the nation struggled with this last 18 months or so was the collision of politics and the law. Do you think there are any lessons to be learned from this clash and the politics that came from the clash of trying to indict and try someone who had been president of the United States and was aspiring to that office again?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think there is a feeling among many people that it wasn't a good idea to indict the president of the United States. I think the trial in New York, where Trump was convicted, I think really helped him in his election effort. And I think there are many people who are - who are Trump supporters who believe that the indictments that came out of the special prosecutor, Jack Smith, were really political as well.",
      "And so I think there's - both sides feel that the other side is really talking past each other. The people who are in the Justice Department now feel that these indictments were fair and correct and had a special prosecutor and so forth. The Trump people believe they were completely political. I hope going forward that the Justice Department is not seen as political because one of the strengths of this country has been the rule of law, and I hope that the Justice Department that's coming in now will continue that tradition.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have a president in mind who, based on your study, grew in your regard and a president in your mind who, based on your study, got more diminished?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Harry Truman left office extremely unpopular, very unpopular, and he was thought to be an inappropriate (ph) successor to the great FDR. Now, because of books by David McCollough and other people who have written great books about Truman, people see him as one of our great presidents because post-World War II he helped end the war because he dropped the atomic bomb, which many people say was a mistake, but ki would say many historians think it was necessary to avoid -",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And he never doubted?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: He never doubted. He never had self-doubt. Self-doubt was one of - was not one of his thing. He always believed it was the right decision. But he also was responsible for NATO, the U.N., the World Bank, the IMF, and the CIA, which he created as well. All these things he created",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And the recognition of Israel.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yes, he recognized Israel, even though his secretary of state threatened to resign over it. So, he was a person who has really risen up.",
      "A person who's gone down, I would say, or two that have gone down a lot. One is Andrew Jackson. Remember, Democrats used to say, we're going to have a Jefferson-Jackson day dinner. You don't have that anymore because Jackson is now widely seen as being racist and very anti-Native American, and he really did many things that I think killed a lot of people, particularly in the Native American community. So, he's not really well respected today by scholars.",
      "Another person I would say is - is that - whose reputation has gone down is Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson was the great reformer after being president at Princeton, two years later he's - he's governor of New Jersey, then president of the United States.",
      "However, he now is widely seen as having done two things that were really big mistakes. One, he resegregated the federal workforce and had been integrated. Two, and this is very damaging I think as well, he - he had a stroke and with about 18 months to go, he couldn't really do what he had done before. He hid that from the public, and his wife essentially became a shadow president. She was really making decisions and deciding things that maybe he should have decided, and the public didn't know this. And that was a big problem.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You often ask biographers what question they would most want to pose to the subject of their presidential biography. Let me expand on that. If you could go to dinner with any president, who would it be, and what question would you want to make sure you got answered?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Without doubt, the greatest president and the greatest American ever is Abraham Lincoln. He was a person who - was not an abolitionist but ultimately came to free the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation. And he also won the Civil War despite the fact that many people in the north didn't really want to fight the Civil War. They'd say, let the south go, we'll have our own country. Lincoln said, no, we're going to hold the union together. And he did that. We lost 3 percent of our population in the war, but he kept the union together and I think made the United States a stronger country as a result.",
      "We ended slavery eventually because of the 13th amendment. But, most importantly, he did it with humility. He didn't run around saying, look, I just won the Civil War. I just did the Gettysburg Address. Isn't that a great speech? He didn't do that. He didn't brag about it. He was very humble. And I think he had a sense of humor and a sense of perspective that is a really good thing for presidents.",
      "And I would like to ask him, do you have any regrets about not having freed the slaves earlier? Do you have any regrets about not getting rid of some of your generals earlier who were not very good? And he waited a couple years before he got Ulysses S. Grant in.",
      "Grant is also a person I should mention. He had the most amazing meteoric rise of almost anybody who's become president. He was selling firewood on the streets of St. Louis in 1860. The war breaks out in 1861, more or less, and eight years later he's president of the United States. I mean it's just amazing.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned humility. George W. Bush told you in your interview with him that that was the most important characteristic a president can possession. I've read other words that are important for presidents - courage, compassion, curiosity, decisiveness. Based on your study, what would you say is the most important?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think the most important thing is having a perspective that you really want to do what's right for the American people. You're not trying to make money. You're not trying to feather your own nest. You're not trying to worry about history. You're just trying to do what's best for the American people.",
      "The qualities that I admire in leaders are people who are reasonably intelligent but not geniuses. You don't have to be a genius to be a great president. People who are willing to listen to other people. People that have some humility. People that are highly ethical. Those are the qualities that I think great leaders have in any area.",
      "Overall, we've gotten some pretty talented people who have served as president of the United States. And we've been fortunate. Lincoln, Washington, FDR, Teddy Roosevelt, Jefferson, and modern day presidents, Eisenhower, among others, have had some really great attributes and the country is good and I think better off for having had good people serve.",
      "One of my concerns in the future is that because it's become so political in Washington sometimes and the fight - infighting has been so intense that I'm not sure that - as many good people want to rise up and run for president in the future as we've seen in the past.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned in your very first answer the Civil War, the greatest time of testing in our country's history. You don't have to be very aggressive online to find casual talk among Americans about another civil war. They banty it about with some frequency.",
      "How worried are you about that, and do you think the mere discussion of it creates the potential of an inevitability?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, I think there has been discussions. Some people say the red states and the blue states should separate, but I don't think that's realistic or really going to happen. I think the country realizes that we are the strongest power in the world economically, militarily, politically, culturally and, in part, because the country's got a big enough population, and in part because we have a lot of attributes in red and blue states. I don't think it's realistic. People talk about that, but I don't think that's going to happen. The country is not going to be split up the way it was in the Civil War. I just don't see that as being realistic or desirable.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any doubt in your mind that presidents, all presidents, must guard against bitterness, anger, resentment, some of the things that fueled their pursuit of the office in the first place? Meaning, once they got there they need to set those things aside, even though they were part of the engine?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Everybody goes through life and has ups and downs. And you get a lot of bitterness and you get resentment of people. People that are good presidents ultimately rise up above that. A lot of people criticized Abraham Lincoln for many, many things. They called him all kinds of terrible names and they did say he was barely human.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: They called him a gorilla.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yes. And he rose above that. And I think you have to rise above it. And, hopefully, when you don't have to worry about politics anymore in a second term, for example, you can rise above all the concerns you've had. When you're president of the United States, if you carry your resentments too long, it can affect others people adversely. So, I think in the case of President Trump, for example, clearly he has some resentments, but I think overall I believe he's going to rise above that in his second term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is Richard Nixon, which you, in your book, describe as a tragic figure, almost a Shakespearean-like tragic figure, the most available cautionary tale about resentments in the presidency?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: If only Shakespeare had been alive to write about Richard Nixon, it would have been a wonderful tragedy. He's a man who's really talented, very smart. He stumbles from running for president in 1960, barely loses. Loses for 1962 in the governorship of California and comes back and is elected in 1968 against all the odds.",
      "But he resented the people that looked down on him. He resented the liberals. He resented the ivy leaguers, as he would call them. And he really, I think, took those resentments and he perpetuated them through his chief of staff, Rob Haldeman and other people. And the result was a terrible thing called Watergate.",
      "I think Richard Nixon, had he not had Watergate, I think he would have gone down as a really impressive president because they opened to China, things he did on the environment. But Watergate will be what he's remembered for.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Was he the least ethical president in our history?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I don't think there's - that's easy to say because some presidents had issues that we don't know about as much. Richard Nixon wasn't a person who was trying to make money for himself necessarily. He wasn't grafting himself into - into business deals and so forth. But I think he had some ethical failings.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The book is called \"The Highest Calling.\" Is the presidency the highest calling? Some might argue that an age defining innovation is a higher calling or being a captain of industry is a higher calling, or just being a simple CEO employing tens of thousands of people is a higher calling. Why is it the highest calling?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: The reason I called it \"The Highest Calling,\" and I had historically said that private equity, my profession, was the highest calling, but that was more tongue-in-cheek, is this. When Woodrow Wilson went to Paris to help end World War I, he was cheered by hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Parisians. And people, for the first time, realized the most important person in the United States, in the world, really, is the president of the United States. And that's been true almost since Wilson came back from Paris.",
      "When FDR was running, the world really effectively, because he was president of the United States during World War II, he was the most important person in the world for sure. And I think ever since then, because of the economic, military, political power of the United States, whoever is the leader of the United States is almost certainly the most powerful person in the world, and pursuing what I would call the highest calling because you can affect the lives of people so much more significantly as president of the United States than any other job in the world.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 29, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the economy and what to expect in year 2025. We do so with Bank of America senior economist Aditya Bhave. Aditya, good morning. It's great to see you. I've covered a lot of presidential transitions. There's always an assessment by the outgoing president about what kind of economy he's giving to his successor. That's a political conversation. Objectively, what is the economy the incoming Trump administration is inheriting?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE, BANK OF AMERICA SENIOR ECONOMIST: Good morning. Thank you for having me so we think the economy has really solid momentum going into next year. You can look at our internal card data, for example, that shows a nice acceleration in spending going into the holidays. You can also look at the TSA data on airport traffic, and that looks really strong around the holiday period as well. You can also think about things via a wider lens. Start in 2022, that was a year in which GDP grew by only 1%, CPI inflation peaked at 9% and all of the talk back then was stagflation. When, not if, is a recession going to arrive, why are workers quiet quitting? And then you look at what happened over the following two years, right. This was quite unexpected, and in a very pleasant way. 3% GDP growth, inflation coming down, labor productivity moving up. So all positives that leave us optimistic going into next year that we can continue to grow above 2% albeit with somewhat sticky inflation.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any larger X factor in 2025 than the scale and scope of promised mass deportations of the Trump administration?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: From a market perspective, I think the two biggest issues will actually be fiscal policy and trade policy, and there's a lot of uncertainty around those as well, just as there is around immigration policy. So with fiscal policy, you had this conversation in your last segment, right? The majority for Republicans in the House is very, very narrow. So if they want to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they want to do more fiscal stimulus, which we think will probably eventually get done, they have a very slim margin to work with. And then with trade policy, we really need to understand, you know, how much of the tariffs that President-elect Trump has threatened are actually going to be implemented versus how much is a negotiating tool, right. So how much is transactional.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And for mass deportations, how much do you fear that could affect the labor market in our country? That is to say, put upward pressure on prices, because if there is mass deportations and workplace inspections, lots of workers in agriculture, construction, meat processing and other vital industries could be pulled out of those sectors.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So I think it's our best case is that there will be a slowdown in the flow of immigrants, right? It's harder to know what will actually happen around deportations. From an economic perspective, a worker is also a consumer, so there are some downside risks to economic activity. If there's a large change in the population right, that's just math. In terms of pressures in specific sectors, it's really going to depend on how things play out. Yes, there could be labor shortages in certain sectors, but it's very hard to know at this stage.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Many CEOs I listen to say that they expect the tariffs and regulatory relief to kind of wash themselves out, meaning, essentially, you put them together, it's benign on the US economy. Is that your perspective?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I think that's about right. If you look at the four key policy issues that we've been focused on, as I said earlier, trade, fiscal policy, immigration policy and deregulation, we think they'll roughly wash out. But again, the starting point is pretty helpful, right? So we think that we can continue to grow at around two to two and a half percent this the coming year, as well as in 2026.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So in reading year end summaries, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, all in their own way, warned that the stock market may be overvalued, may be too exuberant. Do you share any of those concerns?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I'm not an equity analyst, so it's hard for me to say, to give a specific number, our equity strategists do think that stocks can continue to run up to around 66-6700 by the end of this year. What you can say is that obviously there's been a pretty aggressive run up in- in tech stocks, but it is not of the same scale that we saw in the late 90s. If we're really worried about a similar bubble.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What effect do you believe cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence will play in the global economy 2025?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So when it comes to AI, I think there's two things to be said. The actual impact of AI adoption is probably going to show up pretty slowly in the data. So I don't know that we'll necessarily see that in 2025 or 2026, it might be a story for a few years down the line. But what has been really impactful already, and probably will be much more impactful in the coming years, is just laying the groundwork for AI, right? So if you see the increases in investment in data centers, and you think about what all that requires, right? It requires materials. It requires energy supply\u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2013Right we need to, pardon me\u2013",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: \u2013it requires labor, sure.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: I'm sorry to cut you off. We have a hard break we need to get to. Aditya Bhave from Bank of America, Happy New Year, and thank you so much for being with us. We'll be right back in just a moment."

    "story": [
      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Dr. Leana Wen on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 29, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Last week, the US reported its first severe case of bird flu found in a patient in Louisiana. For more, we're joined by Dr. Leana Wen. She is the former Baltimore health commissioner. Dr Leana Wynn, it's great to have you with us. So bird flu, is this report out of Louisiana worrisome? And if so, why?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, it's one more sign that the drum beat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat. So, we've already seen this year that there have been a number of mammalian species close to humans that now have bird flu outbreaks. We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states. 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing. So, we really don't know the extent of bird flu that's out there in humans. But this particular case, it's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors. Bird flu has been around for a long time--",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- About 30 years--",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yeah, exactly. But it hasn't been a major issue in humans, because while it spreads among birds, it hasn't really spread among mammals. But now there is this mutation, and there's another concern now, Major, too which is that we're in flu season, and it's possible that a single person could have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Something called reassortment, that's right, where things change because of one illness becoming another illness through reassortment of a mutated virus.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right. And so, the viruses could exchange genes. You could develop a new hybrid virus, and if you now have a virus that's more contagious and causes more severe disease, that's when it becomes a major threat to humankind.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left. The first is to get testing out there. I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there. It just means that we aren't looking for it. We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not. And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID, where we were dealing with a new virus, we didn't have a vaccine. There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine. However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine. There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out so- and to farm workers and to vulnerable people. I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility, and I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Wen, is bird flu in humans super dangerous?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, the World Health Organization estimates that in prior outbreaks of the bird flu that the mortality rate is 52%. 52%. However, in the- in this most recent outbreak, it seems that most cases have been mild and maybe some people even have asymptomatic infection. But the question is, we don't know what happens when bird flu affects more vulnerable individuals. People infected so far in the US have been mainly farm workers who are working, presumably generally healthy, as opposed to what happens when you get to children, to pregnant women, to older individuals with chronic illnesses. We don't know how deadly, how dangerous bird flu is going to be for those individuals. And again, that's one more reason why we don't want it to spread and acquire more mutations.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: 30 seconds. Norovirus is what you call it. Stomach bug is what I would call it. Numbers are surging. It's the holidays. What should people do to protect themselves?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Wash your hands really well, especially if you're going to buffets. Wash your hands if you're touching commonly touched surfaces before you touch your mouth, before you touch your nose. Norovirus is the most common foodborne illness here in the US. It's very hard to avoid once it's in your family. And also, don't prepare food if you're having vomiting and diarrhea stomach cramps, because you don't want to spread it to other people.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. We really appreciate it. We will have more questions for Dr. Wen when we come back, but first we're going to take a quick break.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with Dr. Leana Wen. Doctor, you talked about vaccines and testing and the context of bird flu and preparations, therefore, vaccines and testing were part of the COVID conversation. And the Trump administration when it was in charge. What level of concern do you have about some of the people appointed by President-elect Trump to incoming public health positions regarding issues of vaccine testing, public health efficacy.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: I think that there are some people coming into this administration who are very competent. For example, Dr. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon. We have worked together for the last 10 plus years on issues like hospital- medical ERM.\u00a0 He's an independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges. But I have a lot of concern, and I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades. He's also someone who has made his career from being an activist and not a scientist. And what I mean is that if you're a scientist, even if you have deeply held convictions, you should be willing to change your mind. If there are new facts that are presented. It's a fact that childhood vaccines are safe and they are life saving. A CDC analysis just now found that the childhood vaccinations have saved over 1.1 million children's lives over the last 20 years. According to a Lancet study, childhood vaccines have saved 154 million lives globally over the last 50 years. I mean, these are facts, and it's very concerning to have someone who doesn't believe in the- in how science works, in basic scientific principles, to be in charge of our nation's preeminent scientific and medical agencies.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: With that perspective, do you believe it's more imperative than you described earlier, for the Biden administration to move forward on bird flu vaccinations and testing?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, that's exactly it. I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence. Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID. There's no reason why we should hold off on getting more testing. We need to know how much bird flu there is out there. We need to know if there are new mutations that are being developed other countries also need to know so that they can prepare as well. And I think it's a major problem that in the US, we have been holding back on testing and also holding back on getting the vaccines deployed that are already developed.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise, thanking you twice and a Happy New Year to you.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Thank you to you too, Major."

      "That's because a black moon is the term for the second new moon to fall in a single calendar month, and new moons appear invisible to the naked eye from Earth. While new moons happen throughout the year, two new moons only fall in a single calendar month about once every 29 months, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",

The next black moon under this definition will be on Aug. 23.",
      "The term black moon can also be used when there are no new moons in a month, which can only happen in February because of its short length. This only happens every 19 years or so, with the next one in 2033, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",

    "story": [
      "A vampire hedgehog, a pygmy pipehorse and a\"blob-headed\" fish were among the hundreds of new species identified in 2024.",
      "The variety of species identified was quite eclectic and names for the new species crossed a broad spectrum of locations and formations \u2014 some even inspired by politicians or celebrities.",
      "A new plant bug species was named after Vice President Kamala Harris (P. kamalaharrisae) and another after Harrison Ford (P. harrisonfordi) for their commitments to climate and conservation science, said California Academy of Sciences researcher Brad Balukjian, who introduced 17 new species in the Pseudoloxops family from French Polynesia.",
      "Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had a new species of snake named after him. Researchers discovered the small copper-colored snake in the Himalayas and named the species Anguiculus dicaprioi.",
      "Locations where scientists discovered these species included Peru, the Ecuadorian Amazon and the Greater Mekong region in South Asia. The California Academy of Sciences said their scientists made findings across six continents and three oceans, which led to describing 138 new animal, plant and fungi species.",
      "\"Finding and describing new species is vital for understanding the biodiversity of our planet and protecting it from further loss,\" said virologist Shannon Bennett, chief of science for the California Academy of Sciences.",
      "The number of new species identified in 2024 cannot be tallied or determined by one list. Researchers present their findings in various papers, conferences and among the scientific community. Inclusion is made tricker because discoveries can be made by anyone, anywhere, but describing and identifying a new species requires a scientific process.",
      "That process involves study and analysis of the new specimen and similar organisms, and then assigning the species a new name. A species can be discovered, but may not necessarily be described until years later.",
      "Bennett told CBS News that when scientists describe a new species, they liken it to \"a coming out ball.\" For the first time, Bennett said, the species is correctly identified and finally has its place in the world.",
      "Regardless, Bennett said \"scientists estimate that we've identified only one-tenth of all species on Earth.\"",
      "Here are some of the 2024 highlights.",
      "Vampire hedgehog, a soft-furred hedgehog with \"fang-like teeth\"",
      "According to\u00a0a report from WWF, 234 species were identified this year in the Greater Mekong region, which includes Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Among them was Hylomys macarong, a vampire hedgehog. The soft-furred hedgehog with fang-like teeth inspired its scientific name. The word Ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng is Vietnamese for \"vampire.\"",
      "First photographed in 2009 in the wild in Vietnam by a team from the Russian Vietnamese Research Centre, the vampire hedgehog was identified as a new species as part of an international effort to revise the taxonomy of lesser gymnures, the WWF said.",
      "Specimens that helped lead to the description of the vampire hedgehog were housed in the Smithsonian, researcher Arlo Hinckley told WWF. He stressed the importance of maintaining collected specimens from \"poorly sampled regions\" in order for \"the next generation\" of researchers to make new discoveries that may have been overlooked.",
      "Pygmy pipehorse, found off the coast of South Africa",
      "Researchers at the California Academy of Scientists knew they might discover something new after local divers in South Africa's Sodwana Bay told them about an unfamiliar species. But scientists were worried they would not be able to spot the tiny pygmy pipehorse \u2014 about the size of a golf tee.",
      "\"South African reefs present notoriously difficult diving conditions with rough weather and intense, choppy waves \u2014 we knew we only had one dive to find it,\" said scientist and study co-author Richard Smith in a news release earlier this month.",
      "But Smith and Graham Short \u2014 the scientist who originally described the pygmy pipehorse genus Cylix in 2021 \u2014 were undeterred, according to the academy. Originally the pygmy pipehorse was found in the cool temperate waters surrounding the North Island of New Zealand. Discovering a new species in subtropical waters expanded the range of the group.",
      "\"Luckily we spotted a female camouflaged against some sponges about a mile offshore on the sandy ocean floor,\" Smith said in the news release.",
      "They named the new pygmy pipehorse species C. nkosi, after the local Zulu word for \"chief,\" the academy said.",
      "\"Blob-headed\" fish baffles researchers",
      "Among eight new species of fish identified in Peru's Alto Mayor region this year, the most shocking was the \"blob-headed fish,\" according to a report published this month by the nonprofit group Conservation International.",
      "In the summer of 2022, researchers with the group's Rapid Assessment Program conducted a biological survey across a largely unstudied area in Alto May's central region and found what was later determined to be at least 27 species new to science and 49 species that are threatened with extinction, per the IUCN Red List.",
      "Among those that were new was a \"blob-headed fish\" in the Chaetostoma\u00a0genus, which includes bristlemouth armored catfish. The team's fish scientists had never seen a fish with an enlarged blob-like head, Conservation International said.",
      "\"The function of this unusual structure remains a mystery,\" researchers said in a statement.",

      "The European Space Agency, or ESA, plans to conduct an orbital test flight of its Space Rider uncrewed spaceplane in the third quarter of 2025. Space Rider is a reusable spacecraft designed to carry out various scientific experiments in low Earth orbit.",
      "These scientific experiments will include research in microgravity, which is the near-weightless environment of space. Scientists will study how plants grow, how materials behave and how biological processes occur without the influence of gravity.",
      "Space Rider will also demonstrate new technologies for future missions. For example, it will test advanced telecommunication systems, which are crucial for maintaining communication with spacecraft over long distances. It will also test new robotic exploration tools for use on future missions to the moon or Mars.",

      "The killer whale calf was spotted in the Puget Sound area off Washington state several days ago. On Tuesday, the center determined J35, also known as Tahlequah, was the baby's mother. The calf, a girl, was given the designation J61.",
      "It's not all good news for the mom and baby though.",
      "\"The team, including multiple experienced killer whale researchers, have expressed concern about the calf's health based on the behavior of both J35 and J61,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Early life is always dangerous for new calves, with a very high mortality rate in the first year. J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days.\"",
      "The organization, which tracks southern resident orca populations in the Pacific Northwest, did not specify what sparked the concern. Seattle-based Orca Conservancy wrote on social media that researchers believe the calf was born prematurely. Orca Conservancy said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been able to spend time on the water with the calf and they observed the baby \"remaining underwater for extended amounts of time indicating nursing or attempts to nurse.\"",
      "\"The calf had also been observed being pushed around on J35's head and was not looking lively, which is a concern, but also added calf behavior is not fully understood,\" Orca Conservancy wrote.",
      "Tahlequah also\u00a0gave birth to a calf in 2020. Experts at the time described it as big news, because up to 70% of orca pregnancies end with a either a miscarriage or a calf that dies shortly after birth.",
      "Southern resident killer whales, like Tahlequah, are the only endangered population of killer whales in the U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The summer population census for 2020 counted only 72 southern resident killer whales, though several calves have been born since the census. Though a recovery plan was completed in 2008, the population continues to struggle and has declined over 10% since 2005.",
      "\"The Southern Resident killer whale population needs ample access to their food supply, mainly salmon, to survive and thrive,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Every single birth counts and these whales need enough fish to be able to support themselves and their calves. We continue to advocate for salmon recovery through habitat restoration, removal of dams, and rational management of fisheries in the Pacific Northwest.\"",

    "summary": "Skywatchers can mark the calendar with a busy lineup of celestial occurrences in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The upcoming year is poised to bring a packed schedule of astral shows, from lunar phenomena to planetary wonders that involve several of Earth's neighbors in the solar system. For skywatchers looking to mark their calendars, here are the top celestial events to watch in 2025.",
      "Jan. 3: Quadrantid meteor shower",
      "Next year's first astral spectacle comes early, on Jan. 3, when the Quadrantid meteor shower peaks. Considered one of the most impressive annual meteor showers to witness, the event can produce between 60 and 200 visible meteors under perfect weather conditions, according to NASA.",

      "See the space missions blasting off in 2025",
      "Jan. 13: Mars occultation",
      "The first full moon of 2025 is called the Wolf Moon. It's also a supermoon, set to appear in night skies Jan. 13, and will pass in front of Mars during a phenomenon known as occultation. People across the United States should be able to see the moon covering Mars before the red planet eventually shows itself again.",
      "March 14: Total lunar eclipse and Blood Moon",
      "A total lunar eclipse will occur March 14, the first of two in 2025 but the only one that will be visible in North America. During a total lunar eclipse, Earth passes between the moon and the sun, and for a time all three are perfectly aligned. The planet casts a shadow onto the moon and prevents most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "This eclipse coincides with the Blood Moon, where the moon bears a reddish hue. The phenomenon happens because some sunlight does filter through Earth's atmosphere and reach the moon during a total lunar eclipse, but in the case of a Blood Moon, only colors with longer wavelengths, like red and orange, actually make it there.",
      "March 29: Partial solar eclipse",
      "A partial solar eclipse will take shape a couple weeks later, on March 29. Like the lunar eclipse preceding it, this is the first of two partial solar eclipses slated for 2025, but the only one that will be visible in North America next year.",
      "The opposite of a lunar eclipse, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, casting its shadow onto the planet as it appears to cover the star. During a total solar eclipse, like the one seen across the U.S. and Mexico last April, the moon completely blocks the sun's rays. A partial eclipse does not have the same effect, but people in some areas will be able to see the moon positioned in front of a portion of the sun.",
      "April 21: Lyrid meteor shower",
      "The Lyrid meteor shower\u00a0is active from April 15 to April 30 next year, according to the American Meteorological Society. It is expected to peak between April 21 and April 22, with people in the Northern Hemisphere most likely to spot the sparkling display.",
      "Aug. 12-13: Perseid meteor shower",
      "The Perseid meteor shower\u00a0will peak between Aug. 12 and Aug. 13. Dubbed the \"best meteor shower of the year\" by NASA, this shower typically has the capacity to produce 50 to 100 visible meteors per hour when skies are clear enough to see them and they aren't overpowered by moonlight.",
      "Unfortunately, the American Meteorological Society notes the Perseids may not be as striking in 2025 because the shower is due to happen at the same time as a waning gibbous moon, and strong moonlight could hide as much as 75% of the meteors.",
      "Aug. 12: Venus-Jupiter conjunction",
      "The conjunction of Venus and Jupiter will fall into place around the time of the Perseids peak, Space.com reports. This alignment of two of the brightest planets in the solar system will bring Venus and Jupiter much closer to each other in the sky than they usually appear.",
      "Sept. 7: Total lunar eclipse",
      "The second total lunar eclipse of 2025 will fall on Sept. 7, according to NASA. People will be able to see it in parts of Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.",
      "Sept. 21: Partial solar eclipse",
      "Another partial solar eclipse is set for Sept. 21. This one will be visible in parts of Australia, in addition to Antarctica and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.",
      "Oct. 7, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4: Supermoons",
      "There will be three supermoons next fall, on Oct. 8, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. A supermoon happens when the full moon phase of the lunar cycle occurs while the moon is located at one of the closest points to Earth in its orbit. Because of the full moon's proximity to the planet, skywatchers tend to see a brighter and larger moon than they normally do. In 2025, the supermoon on Nov. 5 will appear particularly bright, since the moon will be nearest Earth at that time.",
      "Dec. 13-14: Geminid meteor shower",
      "The Geminid meteor shower, known for producing an especially bright and colorful display, peaks annually between Dec. 13 and Dec. 14.",

      "A NASA spacecraft made history and is safe after making the closest-ever approach to the sun. On Tuesday, the Parker Solar Probe\u00a0hurtled through the sizzling solar atmosphere and passed within a record-breaking 3.8 million miles of the sun's surface.",
      "Just before midnight Thursday, scientists at NASA\u00a0received a signal from the probe after it had been out of communication for several days during its burning-hot flyby.",
      "NASA said the spacecraft was safe and operating after its historic flight on Christmas Eve and noted Parker is expected to send back detailed telemetry data on its status on New Year's Day.",
      "Parker got more than seven times closer to the sun than previous spacecraft, traveling at a maximum speed of about 430,000 mph. It's the fastest spacecraft ever built and is outfitted with a heat shield that can withstand scorching temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius).",
      "It will continue circling the sun at this distance until at least September. Since it was launched, Parker has been using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun.",
      "Scientists hope to better understand why the corona is hundreds of times hotter than the sun's surface and what drives the solar wind, the supersonic stream of charged particles constantly blasting away from the sun.",
      "The\u00a0Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 to get a close-up look at the sun. Before this week's historic milestone, Parker had flown straight through the sun's corona, the outer atmosphere visible during a total solar eclipse.",
      "The sun's warming rays make life possible on Earth. But severe solar storms can temporarily scramble radio communications and disrupt power.",
      "The sun is currently at the maximum phase of its 11-year cycle, triggering colorful auroras in unexpected places.",

      "The country's anti-corruption agency said it is investigating whether his declaration amounted to rebellion. But experts still say there is little chance of detention or searches unless Yoon is formally removed from office.",
      "The Seoul Western District Court issued warrants to detain Yoon and to search the presidential office and residence in central Seoul, according to a statement from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities.",
      "Under South Korean law, the leader of a rebellion can face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecution, but the privilege does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "Yoon's powers have been suspended since the opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which drew hundreds of troops and police officers into Seoul streets.",
      "Yoon has argued his decree was a legitimate act of governance, calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which he has called \"a monster\" and \"anti-state forces\" that has used its legislative majority to impeach top officials, undermine the government's budget, and which he claims sympathizes with North Korea.",
      "The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",
      "Experts said Yoon is likely to ignore the warrants. He's ignored repeated requests by investigative authorities to appear for questioning, and the presidential security service has blocked attempts to search his office and residence citing a law that bans raids on sites with state secrets.",
      "A lawyer for Yoon rejected the anti-corruption agency's request for warrants on Monday, arguing it lacked legal authority to investigate rebellion charges.",
      "The anti-corruption agency said it has no immediate plans on how to proceed with the warrants.",
      "\"Unless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,\" said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \"Should investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?\"",
      "Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon's residence to show they are strictly and fairly carrying out their work.",

    "summary": "A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 skidded down the runway and crashed in a fireball in South Korea, and investigators are just beginning the process of figuring out why.",
    "story": [
      "South Korean officials have vowed to find out what caused a Boeing 737-800 passenger jet operated by Jeju Air to crash into flames as it attempted to land over the weekend, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. A day after the disaster, there were still far more questions than answers about the country's worst aviation disaster in decades.",
      "Authorities ordered an immediate inspection of all 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines \u2014 dozens of planes in total \u2014 following the crash, but there was still no clear indication as to whether a system malfunction, human error, or some combination of factors had caused the disaster.",
      "Here is a look at what is known about the Jeju Air crash, and some key questions emerging in the wake of the tragedy.",
      "What happened in the South Korean plane crash?",
      "Jeju Air flight 7C 2216 departed from Bangkok, Thailand, and approached for its scheduled landing Sunday at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea.",
      "After an initial failed landing attempt, the Boeing 737-800 received a bird strike warning from the ground control center. It then ascended again before trying to land a second time.",
      "Two minutes later, the plane's crew sent a distress signal and attempted to land on a different runway. The plane touched down three minutes later without lowering its nose landing gear.",
      "It skidded along the runway at high speed, overshot the end of the runway and slammed into a concrete fence, bursting into a fireball. The only survivors were two crew members rescued from the tail section.",
      "Observers say videos of the crash suggested the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble, but the landing gear malfunction was likely the main reason for the crash.",
      "South Korean Transport Ministry officials said the plane's flight data and cockpit audio recorders \u2014 the so-called \"black boxes\" \u2014 were moved to a research center at Seoul's Gimpo International Airport ahead of analysis. The ministry earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",
      "\"I think the cockpit voice recorder, if they're able to read that out, that will be key to unlocking this mystery,\" Robert Sumwalt, former chair of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, told CBS News.",
      "Jeju Air said the crash was not due to \"any maintenance issues,\" according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, and aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas told BBC News that South Korea's airlines were broadly deemed to follow \"industry best practice\" and that both the plane and Jeju Air had an \"excellent safety record.\"",
      "South Korean plane skidded into a fence shielding antennas",
      "Transport Ministry officials said Monday that they would examine whether the fence the plane hit \u2014 a concrete structure which housed a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. They said they were also trying to establish whether there were any communication problems between air traffic controllers and the pilot.",
      "The positioning of the localizer antennas close to the end of the runway behind unforgiving fortifications will likely be a focus for investigators.",
      "\"Normally, on an airport with a runway at the end, you don't have a wall,\" Christian Beckert, a flight safety expert and pilot for German carrier Lufthansa told the Reuters news agency. \"You more [often] have maybe an engineered material arresting system, which lets the airplane sink into the ground a little bit\" to slow it down.",
      "Could a bird strike have caused the Jeju Air disaster?",
      "Lee Jeong-hyun, the chief of the local Muan fire department, said Sunday that a bird strike and bad weather could have contributed to the crash, but he stressed that the cause was still under investigation.",
      "According to CBS News partner network BBC News, one passenger on the flight had messaged a relative before the disaster and said a bird \"was stuck in the wing\" and that it couldn't land, but officials have not yet confirmed whether there was any bird strike.",
      "Geoffrey Thomas, the expert cited by BBC and the editor of Airline News, told Reuters separately that he was skeptical a bird strike alone could have caused the deadly crash.",
      "\"A bird strike is not unusual. Problems with an undercarriage are not unusual. Bird strikes happen far more often, but typically they don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves,\" he said.",
      "Why wasn't the landing gear deployed?",
      "It remained unclear what, if any, engine or systems failures the flight crew might have been contending with in the last few minutes of the ill-fated flight. Experts have said video of the crash showed no apparent movement of the plane's flaps as it came down, which can help slow an aircraft, suggesting there could have been a loss of hydraulic pressure that controls the mechanical devices.",
      "The hydraulic control systems operate independently, and experts said an engine problem would be unlikely to affect their operation.",
      "The aircraft also has a manual override for pilots to lower landing gear in the event of an electronic or mechanical failure. It was unclear if the Jeju Air crew simply didn't have time to lower the nose wheels manually, or if some other factor could have prevented them from doing so.",
      "Sumwalt, the former NTSB chair, told CBS News, \"I flew 737s for 10 years as a captain, and I can say that the landing gear can be manually deployed, so the real question will be, what set up the sequence of events here? Did the bird strike set up the sequence of events where the crew got rushed and did not deploy the landing gear? I doubt that there was any sort of a malfunction with the gear, given that it can be deployed manually and through the normal means.\"",
      "A long, hard year for U.S. aviation giant Boeing",
      "The crash wrapped up a troubling 2024 for U.S. aviation giant Boeing, which has grappled with safety problems, a machinists strike and plunging stock prices.",
      "Experts say the 737-800 aircraft is a more proven model than the company's much-maligned 737 Max jetliners, which were linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",
      "\"I think it's very important to separate this crash ... from the issues that Boeing has had over the recent past,\" Sumwalt said. \"This airplane is 15 years old, so it was probably not a manufacturing issue if the airplane is that old and flew thousands of hours. It's not a design issue. So I don't think that Boeing is going to take a direct hit because of this one.\"",
      "Still, South Korean authorities said they'll conduct safety inspections on all the 737-800s operated by domestic airlines, including 39 by Jeju Air.",

      "The German government, under fire for failing to prevent a deadly car-ramming attack on a Christmas market, said Monday that the tragedy would have been hard to prevent and said that the suspect appeared to be mentally disturbed.",
      "Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, along with security and intelligence chiefs, faced questioning by a parliamentary committee about the attack and on whether there had been missed clues and security lapses. Five people were killed and more than 200 injured in the Dec. 20 attack in the eastern city of Magdeburg.",
      "Faeser said no motive had yet been established but \"there are striking signs of a pathological psyche\" in the suspect, a Saudi-born doctor who had lived in Germany for years.",
      "She added that lessons must be learned about how to track potential attackers who don't fit conventional threat categories and who \"are psychologically disturbed and... driven by confused conspiracy theories.\"",
      "The minister argued that \"such attackers do not fit any threat profile\" \u2014 such as far-right extremist or Islamist \u2014 and warned that German security services will need \"other indicators and action plans\" to deal with them in future.",
      "The suspect, referred to as Taleb A. by German officials, has been identified by BBC News and the AFP news agency as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen. He came to Germany in 2006 and was granted refugee status 10 years later.",
      "Police arrested him at the scene of the attack in which a motor vehicle was used as a weapon \u2014 a method previously used in jihadist attacks.",
      "In 2016, an Islamic extremist\u00a0plowed through a crowded Christmas market in Berlin\u00a0with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more. The attacker was killed in a shootout days later. That same year, ISIS claimed responsibility after another attacker killed 86 people in a truck rampage in the\u00a0French city of Nice.",
      "Abdulmohsen, by contrast, has in the past voiced strongly anti-Islam views and sympathies with the far right in his social media posts, as well as anger at Germany for allowing in too many Muslim war refugees and other asylum-seekers.",
      "Faeser said there were \"tens of thousands of tweets\" the suspect had posted over the years that were yet to be fully examined.",
      "\"That explains why not everything is on the table yet,\" she said. \"Who knew about which clues and what was passed on when must be carefully clarified.\"",
      "Reuters reported that he posted rambling commentary on X, among other things blaming Germany's supposed liberalism for the death of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, and accusing police of stealing a USB stick from him and destroying a criminal complaint he had filed.",
      "Abdulmohsen, 50, is the only suspect in the attack in which a rented BMW sport utility vehicle plowed through the crowd of revelers at high speed, leaving a bloody trail of carnage.",

      "An Argentine judge confirmed charges against five people in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, and ordered preventive prison for two of them for having supplied him with drugs.",
      "A judicial officer confirmed Monday the judge's decision and said that one of the two people ordered to be put under preventive prison \u2014 a form of pre-trial detention \u2014 was an employee of the hotel in Buenos Aires where Payne stayed until he died after falling from the balcony of his room in October.",
      "The officer said the other person was a waiter Payne met in a restaurant. The officer, who requested not to be identified as a condition to talk about the ruling, said that both face charges for supplying drugs and they need to present themselves before the judge.",
      "The judge also charged three other people with manslaughter, including a businessman who was with Payne in Argentina and two managers of the hotel. The official said that they were not ordered to be held under preventive prison.",
      "The hotel manager and hotel reception manager who were charged saw Payne intoxicated and unable to stand in the hotel lobby prior to his death, according to a\u00a0news release from the prosecutor's office. Authorities said the manager permitted Payne to be taken up to his room, which had a balcony, and the reception manager helped bring him up to his room, instead of keeping him in a place without sources of danger and with company until medical help could arrive.",
      "In November, prosecutors filed initial charges against three people, but they didn't reveal their names.",
      "Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding.",
      "Prosecutors also said that Payne's toxicological exams showed that his body had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\" in the moments before his death.",
      "Payne's autopsy showed his injuries were caused neither by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the possibility that Payne died by suicide.",
      "One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne \u2014 like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson \u2014 pursued a solo career.",

The Friday-Saturday assault on Kamal Adwan in Beit Lahia left northern Gaza's last major health facility out of service and emptied of patients, the WHO said.",
      "\"Hospitals in Gaza have once again become battlegrounds and the health system is under severe threat,\" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X. \"Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza is out of service following the raid, forced patient and staff evacuation and the detention of its director. His whereabouts are unknown. We call for his immediate release.\"",
      "Israel's military said Sunday that its forces had killed approximately 20 Palestinian militants and apprehended \"240 terrorists\" in the raid, calling it one of its \"largest operations\" conducted in the territory. The Israeli military said it had detained Abu Safiyeh, suspecting him of being a Hamas militant. When asked if he had been transferred to Israeli territory for further questioning, the military did not offer an immediate comment.",
      "Israeli officials have consistently accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, positioning its weapons and fighters in and underneath hospitals, schools and other vital infrastructure.

      "Tedros said the patients in critical condition at Kamal Adwan had been moved to the Indonesian Hospital, also in northern Gaza, \"which is itself out of function.\"",
      "\"Amid ongoing chaos in northern Gaza, WHO and partners today delivered basic medical and hygiene supplies, food and water to Indonesian Hospital and transferred 10 critical patients to Al-Shifa Hospital,\" he said. \"We urge Israel to ensure their health care needs and rights are upheld.\"",

      "A new plant bug species was named after Vice President Kamala Harris (P. kamalaharrisae) and another after Harrison Ford (P. harrisonfordi) for their commitments to climate and conservation science, said California Academy of Sciences researcher Brad Balukjian, who introduced 17 new species in the Pseudoloxops family from French Polynesia.",
      "Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had a new species of snake named after him. Researchers discovered the small copper-colored snake in the Himalayas and named the species Anguiculus dicaprioi.",
      "Locations where scientists discovered these species included Peru, the Ecuadorian Amazon and the Greater Mekong region in South Asia. The California Academy of Sciences said their scientists made findings across six continents and three oceans, which led to describing 138 new animal, plant and fungi species.",
      "\"Finding and describing new species is vital for understanding the biodiversity of our planet and protecting it from further loss,\" said virologist Shannon Bennett, chief of science for the California Academy of Sciences.",
      "The number of new species identified in 2024 cannot be tallied or determined by one list. Researchers present their findings in various papers, conferences and among the scientific community. Inclusion is made tricker because discoveries can be made by anyone, anywhere, but describing and identifying a new species requires a scientific process.",
      "That process involves study and analysis of the new specimen and similar organisms, and then assigning the species a new name. A species can be discovered, but may not necessarily be described until years later.",
      "Bennett told CBS News that when scientists describe a new species, they liken it to \"a coming out ball.\" For the first time, Bennett said, the species is correctly identified and finally has its place in the world.",
      "Regardless, Bennett said \"scientists estimate that we've identified only one-tenth of all species on Earth.\"",

      "Vampire hedgehog, a soft-furred hedgehog with \"fang-like teeth\"",
      "According to\u00a0a report from WWF, 234 species were identified this year in the Greater Mekong region, which includes Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Among them was Hylomys macarong, a vampire hedgehog. The soft-furred hedgehog with fang-like teeth inspired its scientific name. The word Ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng is Vietnamese for \"vampire.\"",
      "First photographed in 2009 in the wild in Vietnam by a team from the Russian Vietnamese Research Centre, the vampire hedgehog was identified as a new species as part of an international effort to revise the taxonomy of lesser gymnures, the WWF said.",
      "Specimens that helped lead to the description of the vampire hedgehog were housed in the Smithsonian, researcher Arlo Hinckley told WWF. He stressed the importance of maintaining collected specimens from \"poorly sampled regions\" in order for \"the next generation\" of researchers to make new discoveries that may have been overlooked.",
      "Pygmy pipehorse, found off the coast of South Africa",
      "Researchers at the California Academy of Scientists knew they might discover something new after local divers in South Africa's Sodwana Bay told them about an unfamiliar species. But scientists were worried they would not be able to spot the tiny pygmy pipehorse \u2014 about the size of a golf tee.",
      "\"South African reefs present notoriously difficult diving conditions with rough weather and intense, choppy waves \u2014 we knew we only had one dive to find it,\" said scientist and study co-author Richard Smith in a news release earlier this month.",
      "But Smith and Graham Short \u2014 the scientist who originally described the pygmy pipehorse genus Cylix in 2021 \u2014 were undeterred, according to the academy. Originally the pygmy pipehorse was found in the cool temperate waters surrounding the North Island of New Zealand. Discovering a new species in subtropical waters expanded the range of the group.",
      "\"Luckily we spotted a female camouflaged against some sponges about a mile offshore on the sandy ocean floor,\" Smith said in the news release.",
      "They named the new pygmy pipehorse species C. nkosi, after the local Zulu word for \"chief,\" the academy said.",
      "\"Blob-headed\" fish baffles researchers",
      "Among eight new species of fish identified in Peru's Alto Mayor region this year, the most shocking was the \"blob-headed fish,\" according to a report published this month by the nonprofit group Conservation International.",
      "In the summer of 2022, researchers with the group's Rapid Assessment Program conducted a biological survey across a largely unstudied area in Alto May's central region and found what was later determined to be at least 27 species new to science and 49 species that are threatened with extinction, per the IUCN Red List.",
      "Among those that were new was a \"blob-headed fish\" in the Chaetostoma\u00a0genus, which includes bristlemouth armored catfish. The team's fish scientists had never seen a fish with an enlarged blob-like head, Conservation International said.",

      "Helsinki, Finland\u00a0\u2014 Finnish investigators probing the damage to a Baltic Sea power cable and several data cables said they found an anchor drag mark on the seabed, apparently from a Russia-linked vessel that has already been seized for investigation.",
      "The Estlink-2 power cable, which transmits energy from Finland to Estonia across the Baltic Sea, went down on Dec. 25 after an evident rupture. It had little impact on services but followed earlier damage to two data cables and the Nord Stream gas pipelines, both of which have been termed sabotage.",
      "Finnish police chief investigator, Sami Paila, said late Sunday the trail dragged for \"dozens of kilometers... if not almost a hundred kilometers (62 miles).\"",
      "\"Our current understanding is that the drag mark in question is that of the anchor of the Eagle S vessel. We have been able to clarify this matter through underwater research,\" Paila told Finnish national TV broadcaster Yle.",
      "\"I can say that we have a preliminary understanding of what happened at sea, how the anchor mark was created there,\" Paila said, without providing further details. He also stressed that the \"question of intent is a completely essential issue to be clarified in the preliminary investigation, and it will be clarified as the investigation progresses.\"",
      "On Saturday, the vessel was escorted to inner anchorage in the vicinity of the port of Porvoo, to facilitate the investigation, officials said. It is being probed under criminal charges of aggravated interference with telecommunications, aggravated vandalism and aggravated regulatory offense.",
      "The vessel is flagged in the Cook Islands but was described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union's executive commission as part of Russia's shadow fleet of fuel tankers. Those are aging vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to evade Western sanctions on Russia amid the war in Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance.",
      "Russia's use of the vessels has raised environmental concerns about accidents given their age and uncertain insurance coverage.",
      "In the wake of the cable rupture, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week that the military alliance, which Finland joined last year, will step up patrols in the Baltic Sea region, where tension has increased since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 04:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "South Korean officials ordered safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines as they seek to determine what caused a plane crash that killed 179 people a day earlier\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korean officials said Monday they will conduct safety inspections of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines, as they struggle to determine the cause of a plane crash that killed 179 people a day earlier.",
      "Sunday's crash, the country's worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy.",
      "Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister and acting President Han Duck-soo, the country's top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon's brief imposition of martial law earlier this month.",
      "New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed authorities to conduct an emergency review of the country's aircraft operation systems.",
      "\"The essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\" said Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air aborted its first landing attempt for reasons that aren't immediately clear. Then, during its second landing attempt, it received a bird strike warning from the ground control center before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball.",
      "Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines and now a consultant, said the Boeing 737-800 is a \"proven airplane\" that belongs to a different class of aircraft than the Boeing 737 Max jetliner that was linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",
      "But South Korea's Transport Ministry said Monday it plans to conduct safety inspections of all of the 101 Boeing 737-800 jetliners operated by the country's airlines as well as a broader review into safety standards at Jeju Air, which operates 39 of those planes. Senior ministry official Joo Jong-wan said representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing were expected to arrive in South Korea on Monday to participate in the investigation.",
      "Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport's localizer - a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings - should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa.",
      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots didn't deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and didn;t manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they didn't have time, said John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said.",
      "Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They said there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue.",
      "Earlier Monday, another Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air returned to Seoul's Gimpo International Airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot detected a landing gear issue. Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment center, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precautionary measure.",
      "Local media reported that 21 passengers opted not to board an alternate flight to Jeju due to concern over safety and other reasons, Agence France-Presse reports.",
      "Ministry officials said Monday the crashed plane's flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Gimpo airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",
      "The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "The crash left many South Koreans shocked and ashamed, with the government announcing a seven-day national mourning period through Jan. 4. Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "The Transport Ministry said authorities have identified 146 bodies and are collecting DNA and fingerprint samples from the other 33.",
      "Park Han Shin, a representative of the bereaved families, said they were told that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to their families.",
      "\"I demand that the government mobilize more personnel to return our brothers and family members as intact as possible more swiftly,\" he said, choking down tears.",
      "The crash was yet more major news for South Koreans already reeling from a political crisis set off by Yoon's martial law decree, which brought hundreds of troops into Seoul streets and revived traumatic memories of past military rule in the 1970-80s.",
      "The political tumult resulted in the opposition-controlled National Assembly impeaching Yoon and Han. The safety minister stepped down and the police chief was arrested over their roles in the martial law inforcement.",
      "The absence of top officials responsible for managing disasters has led to concerns.",
      "\"We are deeply worried whether the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters really can handle the disaster,\" the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial Monday.",

    "summary": "North Korea's Kim Jong Un vowed to implement the \"toughest\" anti-U.S. policy, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president.",
    "story": [
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to implement the \"toughest\" anti-U.S. policy, state media reported Sunday, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president.",
      "Trump's return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Many experts, however, say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say.",
      "During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party that ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. \"the most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy.\" Kim said that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into \"a nuclear military bloc for aggression.\"",
      "\"This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,\" Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.",
      "It said Kim's speech \"clarified the strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively\" by North Korea for its long-term national interests and security.",
      "KCNA didn't elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of North Korean soldiers.",
      "The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim \"fell in love.\" But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.",
      "North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals.",
      "Further complicating efforts to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in return for economic and political benefits is its deepening military cooperation with Russia.",
      "According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that 3,000 North Korean troops have been killed and wounded in the fighting in Russia's Kursk region. It was the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties since the North Korean troop deployment to Russia began in October.",
      "Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.",
      "Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington's \"unchangeable\" hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats.",

      "ADDING LAUGHTER TO YOUR LIFE CAN BOOST HEALTH AND HEALING, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"It can be any psychiatric symptom that increases in frequency or intensity as the sun goes down or at night,\" Guastello told Fox News Digital.",

      "What is sunset anxiety, exactly?",
      "Sunset anxiety occurs when a person starts to feel anxious as the sun goes down at the end of the day, Beena Persaud, PsyD, clinical psychologist with Cleveland Clinic Akron General in Akron, Ohio, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The lack of natural light can cause people to have less energy and motivation, restless discomfort, worry and nervousness about accomplishing tasks,\" she said.",
      "GRATEFUL CHILDREN MAKE PARENTS HAPPIER AND LESS STRESSED, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "People who have previously experienced episodes of anxiety and are generally more on the anxious side are more susceptible, Persaud said, as are people who have a heightened sensitivity to light changes and those who consider themselves to be \"night owls.\"",
      "\"Adults are more likely to feel it than teens or children, and this may be due to adults' sense of responsibility for daily activities,\" one expert said. (iStock)",
      "There are no specific gender or racial tendencies for sunset anxiety, the expert noted.",
      "\"Adults are more likely to feel it than teens or children, and this may be due to adults' sense of responsibility for daily activities,\" she added.",
      "Common triggers",
      "The onset of sunset anxiety could be related to the circadian rhythm, which is the body\u2019s internal clock that regulates many functions, according to experts. The circadian rhythm is influenced by the production of melatonin, Persaud said.",
      "\"We know there can be hormonal changes with winter and daylight saving time,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Since our production of melatonin is easily affected by light, early darkness can cause symptoms of both anxiety and depression. The body believes it should be getting ready for bed because of the darkness.\"",
      "\"The lack of natural light can cause people to have less energy and motivation, restless discomfort, worry and nervousness about accomplishing tasks.\"",
      "Experts report an increase in seasonal anxiety from October to late March.",
      "\"The changing of the seasons and earlier darkness make it a prime time for people to experience both sunset anxiety and seasonal depression,\" Persaud said.",

      "Anxiety can also occur if someone is carrying a heavy mental load of activities and responsibilities and struggling to complete them all by the evening.",
      "\"Darkness occurring earlier makes us physically and emotionally tired, and we feel as if the day is ending before we can achieve our daily goals,\" said Persaud.",
      "Tips to alleviate sunset anxiety",
      "Guastello at the University of Florida offered the following tips to help curb anxiety around sunset.",

      "Reporters are trying to figure out who won their elections and who lost. The existing Congress is back, attempting to prevent a government shutdown and often plowing through a landscape of other major legislation. There are often leadership elections. For instance, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., defeated Sen. John Cornyn, R-Tex., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., to succeed outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as the top GOP leader in the Senate. Thune begins as Majority Leader Friday afternoon. We still don\u2019t know how much of a struggle House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., faces returning to the Speaker\u2019s suite. It took former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., 15 rounds before he claimed the Speaker\u2019s gavel in 2023.",
      "Time management is a problem for me with so much going on. The new Congress starts at noon on January 3. So I spend the time between the election and the beginning of the new Congress learning, studying and memorizing the faces and biographies of as many incoming lawmakers as possible.",

In fact, they\u2019ve already become senators. Other new senators are high-profile because they ran in competitive races. Think Sens.-elect Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., and Dave McCormick, R-Penn. Sen.-elect Jim Justice, R-W.V., didn\u2019t face a challenging race to join the Senate.

      "Some names are more prominent than others. For instance, Rep.-elect Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, was known before the election. He defeated Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, in a close race this fall. In addition, his surname is steeped in American political history \u2013 but mostly with the Democratic Party. His uncle is former Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska. His grandfather, the late Rep. Nick Begich, D-Alaska, was killed in a 1972 plane crash with late House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, D-La.

      "1) Unsolicited pop-ups claiming to be from Microsoft or other security services:\u00a0Janet\u2019s story highlights a common scam tactic, which is fake alerts masquerading as official warnings. Microsoft and other legitimate companies do not issue pop-ups with support numbers or direct you to download remote access software.",
      "2) Urgent audio and visual cues: Scammers create a sense of urgency with sirens, flashing messages and warnings of dire consequences to push victims into immediate action without thinking critically.",
      "3) Requests to install remote access software: Scammers often use tools like UltraViewer, TeamViewer or AnyDesk to gain access to victims\u2019 systems. While these tools are legitimate for remote tech support, downloading them at the request of an unknown party is a red flag.",

      "Janet also mentioned that her antivirus software didn\u2019t flag the scam. Unfortunately, many of these scams rely on social engineering rather than malware to bypass antivirus detection. They exploit human psychology, not just technical vulnerabilities. However, running regular scans can still help detect hidden threats.",

      "Stop all communication: Cease all contact with the scammer immediately. Do not engage further or respond to any messages or calls from them.",
      "Report the scam: Report the incident to your local law enforcement agency or the cybercrime unit in your country. Provide them with all the information you have about the scammer and the communication you had with them.",
      "Notify your bank and credit card companies: If you shared any financial information, contact your bank and credit card companies right away. Inform them about the potential scam and ask for advice on how to secure your accounts.",
      "Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and other financial accounts for any suspicious activity. Report any unauthorized transactions immediately.",
      "Inform credit bureaus: Consider contacting credit reporting agencies to put a fraud alert on your credit report. This can help prevent the scammer from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "Be cautious about future communications: Be vigilant regarding any future communications from unknown sources. Scammers may try to target you again using different tactics.",
      "Use identity theft protection: If a scammer gets a hold of your personal information, you may consider a service that will walk you through every step of the reporting and recovery process. One of the best things you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service. One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0Read more of my review of the best identity theft protection services here.",

By recognizing red flags like unsolicited pop-ups, high-pressure tactics and requests for remote access, you can protect yourself and your personal information. If you ever encounter a situation like Janet\u2019s, remember to stay calm, verify the legitimacy of any alerts and take the necessary steps to secure your system. Scammers rely on quick reactions, so slow down, stay in control and don\u2019t let them manipulate your next move.",

      "One of the biggest concerns with both outdoor and indoor security camera apps is the kind of data they collect. Many of these apps gather personal info like your name, email, phone number and physical address. Some apps, such as Arlo, Deep Sentinel, and D-Link, even grab data about your contacts, which can be accessed outside of the app. This data isn\u2019t actually necessary for the apps to do their job.",

      "Among the apps that collect the most data, Deep Sentinel and Lorex stand out for outdoor security cameras, each collecting 18 out of a possible 32 data points. Nest Labs, which leads the pack for indoor cameras, collects 17 data points, with Ring and Arlo each gathering 15.",
      "The absence of regulations and standards for smart home devices creates significant privacy risks. Without clear guidelines, users are vulnerable to data breaches, cyberattacks and even physical harm. Some apps track users for targeted ads or share data with third parties and data brokers. While outdoor security cameras typically avoid tracking, indoor cameras like Nooie and Canary Connect engage in user tracking, further complicating privacy concerns.",

      "9 ways to stay safe from the risks associated with smart home cameras",
      "1. Limit data sharing:\u00a0Look for smart home camera apps that allow you to control what data is shared. Many apps offer settings that let you disable certain data collection features, like location tracking or audio recording. Customizing these settings can significantly reduce your risk of exposing personal information.",
      "2. Regularly review and update privacy settings:\u00a0Smart home cameras often receive software updates that may change privacy settings. It\u2019s important to regularly review the app\u2019s privacy settings to make sure they align with your preferences. Disable features that aren\u2019t essential, such as sharing data with third-party apps or advertisers.",
      "3. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Make sure your camera\u2019s app and associated accounts are protected by strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible: This adds an extra layer of security in case your account information is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Be mindful of camera placement: If your camera is collecting sensitive data like audio or images of people in your home, be mindful of where you place it. Avoid positioning cameras in private areas like bedrooms or bathrooms. This reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data the camera can capture.",
      "6. Consider using local storage instead of cloud services: Some cameras offer local storage options, where footage is stored directly on a device like a hard drive or SD card, rather than in the cloud. This keeps your data more secure since it\u2019s not accessible via the internet and is less likely to be exposed during a data breach.",
      "7. Use a VPN: Encrypt your internet connection with a VPN to safeguard data transmitted from your smart home devices. This is an easy yet powerful way to add an extra layer of protection to your network. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "8. Regularly review privacy policies: Stay informed about how your devices and apps collect, store and share your data. Ensure that you are aware of any changes to privacy terms that may affect your information.",
      "9. Consider\u00a0home security systems with enhanced physical security features, but be aware that, like all smart devices, they collect a variety of user data, including personal information, device data and location tracking. To minimize privacy risks, here are some tips for adjusting the settings within most security system apps:",
      "Disable location tracking: The security company may use location data for features like geofencing, which triggers actions based on your proximity to your home. If you're concerned about privacy, you can disable location tracking in the app to prevent the system from collecting this data.Limit video storage: Many security company\u2019s cameras can store video footage in the cloud, but you can adjust the app settings to limit how long footage is stored or to delete it automatically after a certain period.Adjust device permissions: Review and adjust permissions for devices like cameras and smart locks to limit data collection. For example, disable audio recording if it's not necessary for your security needs.Control third-party data sharing: Your security company may share data with third parties, so it's essential to check and disable any settings that allow your data to be shared beyond your security system\u2019s ecosystem.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "A virtual private network (VPN) is a useful tool that allows you to mask your IP and create a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. This means you can browse the web more privately, especially when connected to a public Wi-Fi network. Another use case for VPNs is accessing sites that are blocked in your region. For example, you could be sitting in New York and accessing content on Chinese social media platforms (though I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing that). However, a VPN can sometimes have the opposite effect, blocking you from accessing content that you were otherwise able to view.",

      "What is a VPN?",
      "A\u00a0virtual private network (VPN) is a secure connection method used to add privacy and security to private and public networks, like the internet and Wi-Fi hotspots. VPNs are often used to protect sensitive data and to ensure that online activities are safe from cyber threats. By encrypting your internet traffic and masking your online identity, a VPN provides anonymity and protects against hackers, snoopers and data breaches. It also allows you to access content that may be restricted based on your geographic location, making it a great tool for boosting your online privacy and freedom.\u00a0Here are 10 reasons you need a VPN at home.",
      "Why are you not able to access certain websites when using a VPN?",
      "Website owners can decide who gets to access their sites and who doesn\u2019t. Many sites block IPs from known VPNs or data centers, especially if their content is restricted to certain countries or regions.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Big platforms like Netflix or banking sites often use VPN detection tools to prevent people from accessing their services anonymously. Government websites do this, too, mostly to prevent people from bypassing regional or national restrictions. For instance, in countries with strict content rules, blocking VPNs helps prevent people from accessing content the government doesn't want them to see.",
      "But even setting your VPN to a different location in the same country doesn\u2019t always work. Why? Because some sites are trying to keep cybercriminals out. VPNs can hide your identity and location, which is great for privacy but can also be misused for fraud. Government websites dealing with things like taxes, voting or benefits need to verify who you are and where you\u2019re logging in from to prevent misuse. Allowing VPNs could make it easier for fraudsters to slip through.",
      "Another reason for blocking VPNs is to keep bots at bay. Bots can use VPNs to scrape government websites or overload their systems. Blocking VPN traffic helps protect sensitive information and makes it easier to trace and authenticate real users.",

      "Using a reliable VPN service is one of the best ways to work around VPN blocks. Not all VPNs are created equal, and choosing a high-quality provider can make a significant difference. Look for a VPN that offers obfuscated or \"stealth\" servers, which disguise VPN traffic to appear as regular internet usage, making it harder for detection systems to block you.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "A good VPN should also have a large server network with plenty of options across different locations so you can easily switch if one server is blocked. Some services even offer dedicated IP addresses, which are less likely to be flagged compared to shared ones.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOTSPOT PRIVACY AND SECURITY WITH A VPN",
      "If one server isn\u2019t working, try connecting to another in the same country or region. VPN providers usually have multiple servers, and switching might help you bypass the block. If this doesn\u2019t work, use obfuscated servers. These servers are designed to hide the fact that you\u2019re using a VPN. They can bypass strict VPN detection systems, especially on government or streaming websites.",
      "To bypass VPN blocks, you can change the connection protocol your device uses. VPN protocols determine how devices link to servers, and some protocols are more adept at evading detection than others.",
      "If you're facing issues accessing specific websites, switching to a different protocol may help. For instance, some protocols offer a good balance of speed and security, while others prioritize faster performance or efficiency, potentially improving your ability to bypass restrictions.",
      "For more detailed information, it's important to research which protocols are best suited for specific use cases, as the effectiveness of different protocols can vary.",
      "WILL A VPN PREVENT APPS FROM TRACKING ME?",
      "If you only need the VPN for certain apps or websites, enable split tunneling in your VPN settings. This lets you access blocked sites using your regular connection while keeping the VPN active for other purposes. For example, you can enable split tunneling to watch a movie on Netflix using your regular internet connection while keeping your banking app secure with the VPN.",
      "Not all VPNs are created equal. Some are better at bypassing blocks than others. If your current VPN isn\u2019t working, consider switching to one that specializes in evading detection.",

There are a few ways to get around these blockers, and sometimes, it's just as easy as switching servers. You\u2019ll have the best chance of getting your VPN unblocked if you're using a reliable service.

      "Around 100,000 individuals, according to reports, have disappeared into Assad'a prisons, where people, including thousands of women and children, were detained, tortured and killed.",
      "\"Rights groups have documented that at least 10% of those detained lost their lives in these prisons, though some reports suggest the figure could be as high as 20%,\" said Joseph Braude, founder of the Center for Peace Communications, an NGO dedicated to resolving identity-based conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, whose group gained rare access to Sednaya. \"The number continues to rise as families speak out about the whereabouts of their missing loved ones, many of whom remain unaccounted for.\"",

      "Al Hendi continued: \"I\u2019ve heard from my friends describing the sights going into Sednaya this week. They found bags of bones, there was still fresh blood on the floor, the smell of death, and the torture machines, which were the most horrible things they\u2019ve seen. One friend told me he saw a mother hugging the torture machine, believing her son had died there. It was a tragic image, seeing her holding the machine that killed her son, thinking she could still smell him in the machine. The tools were unimaginable, like a massive metal press designed to liquefy bodies and make them unrecognizable.\"",
      "As Assad regime\u2019s atrocities at Sednaya become clearer, and after days of looking for survivors and realizing that some people may never be found, attention has shifted to mass graves.

      "\"Some of the people in these mass graves came from Sednaya and died under torture,\" Al Hendi said. \"Many show gunshot wounds, and their bodies were moved to a large area where the regime placed old military equipment to create the illusion of a restricted military zone. Locals reported seeing refrigerated trucks entering the area with security forces blocking the roads. The trucks stayed for hours before leaving. People became accustomed to the smell of death.\"",

We found children born there as a result of rape by prison guards. Entire families were destroyed by the regime.\"",
      "The conditions in Sednaya were inhumane.

If we don\u2019t do that, we risk perpetuating cycles of vengeance.\"",
      "After the fall of the Assad regime earlier this month, Sednaya was liberated, and thousands of prisoners were freed. \"The prisoners who emerged from Sednaya were traumatized, many of them unable to even remember their own names,\" Al Hendi said. \"They had been detained for so long they didn\u2019t even know that Assad\u2019s father had died.

He emphasized the urgent need to preserve this evidence, warning, \"Time is running out. There is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold. Each day we fail to do so, we risk losing the chance for comprehensive accountability.\"",
      "The investigations into Sednaya and the mass graves have painted a horrific picture of the regime\u2019s violence, but they also serve as a call for justice, Braude said. \"The consequences of the Assad regime\u2019s atrocities are profound. The key question now is how the population can move forward and rebuild, rather than descending into further civil conflict. There is a fear of cycles of vengeance, but true reconciliation can only come through truth and acknowledgment.\"",
      "He said that \"99% of Syria\u2019s prison guards belong to the Alawi community.\" \"We\u2019re talking about half the young population of the Alawi sect, as most of them work in the army or secret police. The rebels have proposed a solution: Russia will surrender Assad and 100 top officials responsible for the atrocities. In return, rebels would offer amnesty to low-level perpetrators who were following orders. If Russia facilitates this, it could help prevent further violence and bring stability to Syria.\"",

      "\"The NTSB is leading a team of U.S. investigators (NTSB, Boeing and FAA) to assist the Republic of Korea\u2019s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) with their investigation of the Dec. 29 Jeju Air accident at Muan International Airport in Muan, Republic of Korea,\" the NTSB Newsroom account wrote on X.",
      "Ministry officials also said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "Joo said the ministry has determined that similar concrete structures are in other domestic airports, including in Jeju Island and the southern cities of Yeosu and Pohang, as well as airports in the United States, Spain and South Africa.",
      "Sunday's crash, the country\u2019s worst aviation disaster in decades, triggered an outpouring of national sympathy. Many people worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the disaster as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country\u2019s top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon\u2019s brief imposition of martial law earlier this month.",
      "New acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed authorities to conduct an emergency review of the country\u2019s aircraft operation systems.",
      "\"The essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\" Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister, said, according to the Associated Press.",

      "The Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air aborted its first landing attempt for reasons that aren\u2019t immediately clear. Then, during its second landing attempt, it received a bird strike warning from the ground control center before its pilot issued a distress signal. The plane landed without its front landing gear deployed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball.",
      "The Transport Ministry said authorities have identified 146 bodies and are collecting DNA and fingerprint samples from the other 33, according to the AP.",
      "Park Han Shin, a representative of the bereaved families, said they were told that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to their families.",
      "\"I demand that the government mobilize more personnel to return our brothers and family members as intact as possible more swiftly,\" he said, choking down tears.",
      "Earlier Monday, another Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air returned to Seoul\u2019s Gimpo International Airport shortly after takeoff when the pilot detected a landing gear issue. Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue was resolved through communication with a land-based equipment center, but the pilot decided to return to Gimpo as a precautionary measure.",

      "\"Our current understanding is that, at some point during the go-around process, communication became somewhat ineffective or was interrupted, ahead of the landing and impact,\" he said.",
      "Ministry officials said Monday the plane\u2019s flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Gimpo airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",
      "The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "The crash left many South Koreans shocked and ashamed, with the government announcing a seven-day national mourning period through Jan. 4. Some questioned whether the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, such as a 2022 Halloween crush in Seoul that killed 160 people and a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people.",
      "Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida, told the AP.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for the barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said. Other observers said the videos showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble, but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They told the AP there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problem and the suspected engine issue.",

    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s opposition parties moved Wednesday to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "South Korea\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly voted Friday to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo despite vehement protests by governing party lawmakers, further deepening the country\u2019s political crisis set off by President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment.",
      "Han\u2019s impeachment means he will be stripped of the powers and duties of the president until the Constitutional Court decides whether to dismiss or reinstate him. The court is already reviewing whether to uphold Yoon's earlier impeachment. The impeachments of the country\u2019s top two officials has worsened its political turmoil, deepened economic uncertainties and hurt its international image.",
      "The single-chamber National Assembly passed Han\u2019s impeachment motion with a 192-0 vote. Lawmakers with the governing People Power Party boycotted the vote and surrounded the podium where assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik was seated, shouting that the vote was \"invalid\" and demanding Woo's resignation. No violence or injuries were reported.",
      "The PPP lawmakers protested after Woo called for a vote on Han\u2019s impeachment motion after announcing its passage required a simple majority in the 300-member assembly, not a two-thirds majority as claimed by the PPP. Most South Korean officials can be impeached by the National Assembly with a simple majority vote, but a president\u2019s impeachment needs the support of two-thirds. There are no specific laws on the impeachment of an acting president.",
      "SOUTH KOREA LAWMAKERS VOTE TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT OVER MARTIAL LAW DECLARATION",
      "The national assembly in South Korea voted to impeach President Han Duck-soo. (Hong Hae-in/Yonhap via AP)",
      "In a statement, Han called his impeachment \"regrettable\" but said he respects the assembly's decision and will suspend his duties to \"not add to additional confusion and uncertainty.\" He said he will wait for \"a swift, wise decision\" by the Constitutional Court.",
      "Han\u2019s powers were officially suspended after copies of his impeachment document were delivered to him and the Constitutional Court. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, took over.",

He also told the foreign ministry to inform the U.S., Japan and other major partners that South Korea's foreign policies remain unchanged.",
      "Han, who was appointed prime minister by Yoon, became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the National Assembly about two weeks ago over his short-lived Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Han quickly clashed with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party as he pushed back against opposition-led efforts to fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court, establish an independent investigation into Yoon\u2019s martial law decree and legislate pro-farmer bills.",
      "At the heart of the fighting is the Democratic Party\u2019s demand that Han approve the assembly's nominations of three new Constitutional Court justices to restore its full nine-member bench ahead of its ruling on Yoon\u2019s impeachment. That\u2019s a politically sensitive issue because a court decision to dismiss Yoon as president needs support from at least six justices, and adding more justices will likely increase the prospects for Yoon\u2019s ouster. Yoon\u2019s political allies in the governing party oppose the appointment of the three justices, saying Han shouldn\u2019t exercise the presidential authority to make the appointments while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office.",
      "On Thursday, Han said he wouldn\u2019t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. Later in the day, the Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the assembly, submitted an impeachment motion against Han and passed bills calling for the appointment of three justices.",
      "South Korean investigative agencies are probing whether Yoon committed rebellion and abuse of power with his marital law decree. Yoon has repeatedly ignored requests by authorities to appear for face-to-face questioning,",
      "His defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have already been arrested over the deployment of troops and police officers to the National Assembly, which prompted a dramatic standoff that ended when lawmakers managed to enter the chamber and voted unanimously to overrule Yoon\u2019s decree.",

The reports said Kim, a close associate of Yoon, became the first person to be formally charged over the martial law decree. Calls to a Seoul prosecutors' office were unanswered.",
      "Han's impeachment motion accuses him of collaborating and abetting Yoon's declaration of martial law. It also accuses Han of attempting to obstruct the restoration of the Constructional Court's full membership and of delaying investigations into Yoon's alleged rebellion by not appointing independent counsels.",

    "story": [
      "As the nation mourns the loss of Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at age 100, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders look back on the historic contribution the then-president made to the community.",
      "Following a push from several Asian American lawmakers, Carter, the country\u2019s 39th president, signed a proclamation that designated May 4, 1979, as the start of Asian Pacific American Heritage Week. It was the first time in the country\u2019s history that the racial group had a nationally recognized celebration. Decades later, the week would be extended, becoming the heritage month now celebrated annually.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we have not always fully appreciated the talents and the contributions which Asian-Americans have brought to the United States,\u201d Carter wrote in his proclamation. \u201cYet, Asians of diverse origins \u2014 from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia \u2014 continued to look to America as a land of hope, opportunity, and freedom.\u201d",
      "Madalene Mielke, president and CEO of the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies, said that Carter\u2019s declaration was a profound step in acknowledging the racial group\u2019s critical role in the country\u2019s legacy.",
      "\u201cIt really created this idea that we aren\u2019t disposable constituents,\u201d Mielke told NBC News. \u201cThat is really how this country has started to recognize us as a community and as people who have been active citizens and participants in the growth of this country.\u201d",
      "Carter\u2019s proclamation followed the work of then-Reps. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., who was Japanese American, and Frank Horton, R-N.Y., who introduced legislation in June 1977 that would have formally established a heritage celebration of 10 days. Then-Sens. Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, both Democrats of Hawaii and fellow Asian Americans, followed suit, introducing sister legislation in the Senate.",
      "While neither bill passed, Horton pushed for a second joint resolution that would designate a week of celebration and \u201cinclude the seventh and tenth of the month.\u201d The effort was successful and eventually signed by the president. The commemorative week later became a month under President George H.W. Bush in 1992.",
      "May was chosen for the occasion to commemorate the first Japanese immigrants who came to the U.S. on May 7, 1843. It also coincides with the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869, which was built in large part by Chinese railroad workers.",
      "Mielke underscored that the national recognition from Carter wouldn\u2019t have been possible without decades of work from Asian American and Pacific Islander advocates and legislators themselves, who had long championed the racial group.",
      "\u201cThis is something that former Secretary Mineta really believed in \u2014 not having homogeneity. He really believed that we were woven pieces of cloth as a country because each of our identities really bring about the creation of this country,\u201d Mielke said. \u201cThis type of recognition is a part of understanding that we are not blending into society; we are also becoming, changing what society looks like and what is deemed American.\u201d",
      "The proclamation was, in a way, a display of solidarity from Carter, she said.",
      "\u201cI think his legacy is really the work that he has done to support all the people in Congress who wanted to be sure that this was a recognition for our community,\u201d she said.",
      "The proclamation also served as an important symbol of allyship and encouragement for legislators from other communities to value AAPI, Mielke said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean it\u2019s validation. It\u2019s really how you work allyship,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at age 100, stood out for his early support for pro-gay legislation and his embrace of LGBTQ advocates, historians say.",
    "story": [
      "When Jimmy Carter was president from 1977 to 1981, gays and lesbians were unable to obtain government security clearance, same-sex intimacy was illegal in at least two dozen states, and gay marriage was no more than a radical pipe dream. Moreover, political support for LGBTQ causes was still largely taboo for politicians on both sides of the aisle.",
      "But Carter, a Southern Democrat and devout Baptist, stood out for his early support for\u00a0pro-gay legislation and his embrace of LGBTQ advocates.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re looking at the federal or White House response to LGBTQ issues, the first time we see it is under Carter, which I think in the mid-\u201970s is incredibly brave,\u201d said Michael Bronski, a professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at Harvard University and the author of \u201cA Queer History of the United States for Young People. \u201cIt would have been just as easy for him not to say anything.\u201d",
      "In 1976, when Carter, a former Georgia governor, was running for president, he voiced his support for legislation that is controversial even among some of today\u2019s politicians. The measure, known as the Equality Act, sought to amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. (An updated version of the bill, which included a ban on gender-identity discrimination, passed the House in 2021 but stalled in the Senate.)",
      "Asked about the Equality Act at a news conference in May 1976, Carter said, \u201cI will certainly sign it, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to single out homosexuals for special abuse or special harassment,\u201d according to the National Archives.",
      "Several days after his public comments, Carter\u2019s team reiterated his stance on the controversial issue in a statement, citing his previous comments on passing anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\u201cAs President, I can assure you that all policies of the federal government would reflect this commitment,\u201d he told Philadelphia Gay News in March 1976, according to a copy of the release on the National Archives website.",
      "Later that year, civil rights pioneer Harvey Milk endorsed Carter in a column in the Bay Area Reporter, calling him a \u201cman who believes that the government has no business in a person\u2019s bedroom.\u201d Milk went on to become one of the country\u2019s first openly gay elected officials when he won a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977; he was assassinated the following year.",
      "Perhaps most significantly, historians say, was when a group of roughly two dozen activists from the National Gay Task Force met with presidential adviser Margaret \u201cMidge\u201d Costanza to discuss discrimination protections at the White House in 1977.",
      "James Kirchick, author of \u201cSecret City: The Hidden History of Gay Washington,\u201d noted that the gathering not only marked the first White House meeting with gay activists but also came shortly after the U.S. Civil Service Commission lifted its ban on gay people working in the federal government in 1975.",
      "\u201cUp until that point, gay people can be prevented from and purged from government jobs in large numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to have just within two years a meeting with gay rights organizers and leaders was pretty significant and a way to put the imprimatur of the presidency on this issue and to signal to the country that gay people were citizens and deserved recognition as citizens.\u201d",
      "Kirchick cautioned that the meeting did not produce tangible results and that it took place while Carter was away at the presidential country residence at Camp David, Maryland. He believes, according to his research, that while the administration allowed the meeting to occur, it would have been too controversial for Carter to attend it.",
      "\u201cThey did not want a photo-op with the president and these leaders,\u201d Kirchick said, referring to the Carter administration. \u201cIt was scheduled deliberately while he was out of town.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, the meeting was unprecedented and symbolic, creating fanfare among some of the most prominent anti-LGBTQ voices of the \u201970s.",
      "\u201cBehind the high-sounding appeal against discrimination in jobs and housing, which is not a problem to the \u2018closet\u2019 homosexual, they are really asking to be blessed in their abnormal life style by the office of the President of the United States,\u201d Anita Bryant, a singer and former Miss Oklahoma known for her Florida orange juice commercials-turned-anti-LGBTQ activist, said in a statement to The New York Times at the time. \u201cWhat these people really want, hidden behind obscure legal phrases, is the legal right to propose to our children that there is an acceptable alternate way of life \u2014 that being a homosexual or lesbian is not really wrong or illegal.\u201d",
      "Bronski said figures like Bryant, who launched the infamous \u201cSave Our Children\u201d campaign in 1977, and the broader rise of the religious right in the \u201970s made what would be a routine White House meeting by today\u2019s standards all the more significant.",
      "\u201cWhat we see with Carter is that he\u2019s really sympathetic to it,\u201d Bronski said of gay rights, \u201cand he\u2019s setting up a sort of different national paradigm that counters these groups.\u201d",
      "In 1978, Carter again aligned himself with the gay community, urging California voters to defeat Proposition 6, also known as the Briggs Initiative, a controversial, headline-grabbing measure that sought to bar gay and lesbian people from teaching in public schools.",
      "\u201cAs long as I am in the White House, our nation will always be identified as the nation that will insist and fight for basic human rights,\u201d Carter said at a November 1978 \u201cGet Out the Vote\u201d rally in Sacramento, California, according to a transcript of the speech published by the University of California, Santa Barbara. \u201cI also want to ask everybody to vote against Proposition 6.\u201d",
      "The measure was defeated 58.4% to 41.6%, according to the GLBT Historical Society.",
      "Bronski and other historians say that while Carter\u2019s efforts to move the needle on gay rights may seem \u201csmall\u201d by today\u2019s standards, he planted the seeds for future presidents.",
      "\u201cHe may not have done as much as we wanted him to or he may not have done it as much as he could have or he may have been playing it safe in some ways,\u201d Bronski said. \u201cBut he is literally the first person to begin to articulate policies around this issue, breaking barriers for other Democratic presidents to do this.\u201d",
      "Carter\u2019s defeat",
      "Historians stressed that what Carter did for gay rights during his presidency cannot be remembered without acknowledging what came directly afterward \u2014 and what may have been, had Carter been able to continue moving the needle, albeit slowly, for gays and lesbians.",
      "In 1980, Carter lost his presidential re-election campaign to \u201cMoral Majority\u201d ally Ronald Reagan, a Republican, roughly one year before the first official government report on AIDS was released. To this day, activists blame the Reagan administration for not taking the growing medical crisis seriously.",
      "Asked about whether Reagan was tracking the spread of AIDS in 1982, his press secretary, Larry Speakes, infamously laughed. Reagan first publicly mentioned AIDS only in 1985. By that time, an estimated 12,500 people had already died of the disease, according to global nonprofit group amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "\u201cIf Carter had won and was president when the AIDS crisis started, we would have seen a completely different federal response to the AIDS crisis and probably would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives,\u201d Bronski said.",
      "\u2018Jesus never said a word about homosexuality\u2019",
      "Long after he left the White House, Carter continued to vocally support gay people.",
      "In 2012, roughly two months before President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, Carter became one of the most prominent Americans to voice his support for same-sex marriage. And Carter \u2014 who taught Sunday school since he was 18 \u2014 used an atypical reason to justify his support: Christianity.",
      "\u201cHomosexuality was well-known in the ancient world, well before Christ was born, and Jesus never said a word about homosexuality,\u201d Carter said in an interview with HuffPost at the time. \u201cIn all of his teachings about multiple things \u2014 he never said that gay people should be condemned. I personally think it is very fine for gay people to be married in civil ceremonies.\u201d",
      "In his death, historians say,\u00a0Carter may not be the first figure whom LGBTQ Americans recall when they think of equality. However, they say, his legacy on LGBTQ rights was more consequential and courageous than he has often been given credit for."

    "summary": "Under former president Jimmy Carter \u2014 whom Black voters overwhelmingly supported in the 1976 presidential race \u2014 Black women were catapulted into key posts.",
    "story": [
      "When Alexis M. Herman first met Jimmy Carter back in the 1970s, she never imagined how their fates would intertwine, nor the heights to which their careers would rise.",
      "\u201cHe was governor of Georgia then, and I was just a few years out of college,\u201d Herman said. Herman, an Alabama native and Xavier University alumna, was a volunteer on civil rights leader Andrew Young\u2019s congressional campaign when \u201cAndy introduced me to Jimmy Carter and told him of the work I was doing.\u201d",
      "At the time, Herman was involved in an experimental project to create a minority women\u2019s employment program in Atlanta. \u201cIt was the height of the women\u2019s movement,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut women of color were not getting certain opportunities.\u201d",
      "Her efforts helped place the first Black women in professional and technical roles at major corporations such as General Motors, Coca-Cola, Xerox and Delta Air Lines. From Georgia, the initiative spread across the South.",
      "Carter seemed impressed. After he defeated incumbent Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election, he nominated Herman to be director of the Women\u2019s Bureau in the Labor Department.",
      "Years later, during the Clinton administration, Herman returned to the department \u2014 this time as the country\u2019s first Black labor secretary.",
      "From judgeships to Cabinet-level appointments, Black women broke ground in Carter\u2019s administration. He was in office from 1977 to 1981, amid the wave of feminist and gender activism that followed the height of the Civil Rights Movement.",
      "After the announcement last year that Carter, 100, had entered hospice care at home, Black women who worked with Carter during his administration told NBC News that Carter, who died Sunday, had long been a champion of women, notably as shifting gender norms coincided with his term.",
      "At 29, Herman was the youngest person to fill the director role at the Women\u2019s Bureau, which was established in 1920. She spent her three-year tenure advocating for women-centric policy issues that ran the gamut from equal pay and child care to maternity leave and sexual harassment protections.",
      "\u201cThere is not one single initiative related to women\u2019s rights that did not have its foundation in the Carter administration,\u201d Herman said.",
      "According to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, Carter is one of 12 presidents who have appointed women to Cabinet or Cabinet-level positions since President Franklin D. Roosevelt named Frances Perkins labor secretary in 1933. During his four years in the White House, Carter appointed four women to such positions, CAWP data shows.",
      "Under Carter \u2014 whom Black voters overwhelmingly supported in the 1976 presidential race, a contest they were credited with helping him win \u2014 Black women were catapulted into key posts.",
      "In 1977, he appointed Patricia Roberts Harris, a Howard University alumna and attorney, as secretary of housing and urban development, making her the first Black woman to serve as a White House Cabinet secretary.",
      "When Carter later named Harris the first secretary of the newly reorganized Department of Health and Human Services, she became the first woman to hold two different Cabinet positions.",
      "Hazel R. O\u2019Leary, a corporate attorney who initially joined the Ford administration, rose through the ranks under Carter to be chief administrator of the Economic Regulatory Administration in the newly created Energy Department.",
      "Carter tapped Eleanor Holmes Norton, now Washington, D.C.\u2019s delegate to Congress, to become the first woman to head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1977.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of President Carter is he was ahead of his time\u201d because of his inclusion of Black women in key roles, said Shavon Arline-Bradley, the president and CEO of the National Council of Negro Women. She pointed to Dorothy Height, the late civil rights leader who led NCNW for four decades.",
      "In her book \u201cOpen Wide the Freedom Gates,\u201d Height wrote that Carter appointed her to the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research.",
      "\u201cThe other fifteen members were professionals in fields like medicine, ethics, law, health and education. I was a public member,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd I brought to the commission what I had learned face to face with poor women. I could be the voice of women who knew that their rights had been violated. I had something to contribute in the shaping of public policy recommendations and pressed for policies to be written so that they were understandable.\u201d",
      "While the Congressional Black Caucus of that era was sometimes critical of Carter\u2019s policies and the impact on Black Americans, he regularly engaged with its members. They included Black congresswomen who were powerhouses on Capitol Hill and the national stage, like Rep. Shirley Chisholm, of New York, a Democrat with Caribbean roots who was reportedly driven to tears calling out the administration\u2019s Haiti policy.",
      "Rep. Barbara Jordan, D-Texas, campaigned for Carter and was a keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention where he was nominated for president.",
      "\u201cCarter and Jordan were political allies,\u201d said Carla Brailey, an associate professor of sociology and a senior fellow at the Barbara Jordan Institute for Policy Research at Texas Southern University, where Jordan was an alumna.",
      "Once he was elected, \u201cCarter reportedly considered Barbara Jordan on his short list for the job of attorney general,\u201d she said. Jordan did not get the job, Brailey said, but she was offered a United Nations post \u2014 a position she apparently did not covet.",
      "Carter grew up in Plains, Georgia, where his father was a farmer and businessman and his mother was a registered nurse. As a child, he formed close, endearing relationships with Black members of his small community in an era of segregation. Following military service as a naval officer, he returned home to run his family\u2019s peanut farm and later sought public office.",
      "Karin Ryan, senior policy adviser for human rights at the Atlanta-based Carter Center, worked alongside Carter for some decades. \u201cHuman rights, democracy and women\u2019s rights are pivotal to our work,\u201d she said of his presidency and post-presidency.",
      "With former first lady Rosalynn Carter, the center placed a major emphasis on advancing the rights of women and girls globally. In his 2014 book, \u201cA Call to Action: Women, Religion, Violence, and Power,\u201d Carter wrote, \u201cThe world\u2019s discrimination and violence against women and girls is the most serious, pervasive, and ignored violation of basic human rights.\u201d",
      "In public speeches, he challenged misinterpretations of religious scriptures relegating women to secondary status and decried practices such as genital mutilation, honor killings and sex trafficking.",
      "Today, the center\u2019s programs promote women\u2019s leadership in peace-building, combating sexual exploitation and strengthening the capacity of organizations serving less developed nations to promote gender equality, improve women\u2019s access to education and more.",
      "Rep. Nikema Williams, a Democrat, represents Georgia\u2019s 5th Congressional District, known as the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement.",
      "\u201cPresident Jimmy Carter is an inspiration. He never stopped working for peace, democracy and uplifting those most marginalized,\u201d Williams said in a statement. \u201cI named my son Carter after this great President. I strive everyday to make sure Carter has the same humility and commitment to service as his namesake.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Dec. 30, 2024, 6:15 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Carla Brailey\u2019s position at Texas Southern University. She is an associate professor of sociology, not an assistant professor.",
      "A previous version of this article misstated how many Black women Carter appointed\u00a0to his Cabinet and to Cabinet-level positions. It was one, not four."

      "Facing a public relations checkmate, the International Chess Federation surrendered and allowed world champ Magnus Carlsen to wear jeans Monday at the World Blitz Championship in New York City.",
      "\"I sincerely regret that this situation escalated without a resolution being found by both sides in time to prevent Magnus\u2019s withdrawal,\" Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the chess federation, which uses the French acronym FIDE, said in a statement released Sunday.",
      "\"The concerns raised by Magnus Carlsen highlight the need for further discussion about how to modernize the current approach, to ensure that our rules and their application reflect the evolving nature of chess as a global and accessible sport.\"",
      "So while FIDE still has an official dress code, Dvorkovich said it now allows for \"elegant minor deviations\" such as \"appropriate jeans matching the jacket.\"",
      "\"Oh, I am definitely playing in jeans tomorrow,\" Carlsen responded on X after the FIDE statement was released.",
      "FIDE found itself playing defense Friday after Carlsen, a five-time world chess champion and seven-time world blitz chess champion,\u00a0defied the dress code by wearing jeans at the World Rapid Chess Championship, which was also held in New York City.",
      "Rather than change out of the jeans he'd been wearing and pay a $200 fine, the Norwegian chess grandmaster refused to play and also withdrew from the World Blitz Championship.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Carlsen declined, and as a result, he was not paired for round nine,\u201d the organization said in a\u00a0post on\u00a0X, adding that the dress code is \u201cdesigned to ensure professionalism and fairness for all participants.\u201d",
      "Carlsen told Take Take Take on Sunday\u00a0that, before the event, he had a lunch meeting and \u201cbarely had time to go to the room [to] change.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, I put on a shirt, jacket and honestly I didn\u2019t even think about the jeans.

I got a fine and then I got a warning that I would not be paired if I didn\u2019t go change my clothes.\u201d",
      "Carlsen said he was told he could change after the third round.",
      "\u201cI said, like, \u2018I\u2019ll change tomorrow if that\u2019s OK. I didn\u2019t even realize it today.\u2019 But they said, \u2018You have to change now.\u2019 At that point, it became, you know, a bit of a matter of principle for me. So here we are.\u201d"

      "To boxing and Olympics enthusiasts, Claressa \u201cT-Rex\u201d Shields is a household name. The film \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d starring Ryan Destiny as Shields and Brian Tyree Henry as her trainer, Jason Crutchfield, now aims to bring the 29-year-old phenomenon's story into every household and the world.",
      "Written by Oscar-winning \u201cMoonlight\u201d filmmaker Barry Jenkins and directed by Oscar-nominated cinematographer Rachel Morrison, who worked on \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d traces Shields\u2019 boxing journey starting at age 11, concentrating on her teen years working with volunteer boxing coach Jason Crutchfield, through her historic 2012 Olympics win at 17 and its aftermath, which included numerous titles and her second Olympic gold in 2016.",
      "As a young Black girl growing up in Flint, Michigan, in a struggling household where she and her siblings often went hungry, Shields\u2019 rise to become the first female boxer to win an Olympic gold medal for the United States was not exactly in the cards.",
      "And casting Destiny for the lead role was unconventional, too, as she had started her career as a singer in girl groups before co-starring in the Lee Daniels\u2019 TV series \u201cStar,\u201d about an aspiring girl group.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, I had been wanting to do a project that really challenged me in a different way. With a project like this, it wasn\u2019t something that specifically came to me,\u201d the actor said.",
      "In fact, to score this role, Destiny said she truly had to earn it.",
      "Beyond the long audition process, the physical transformation into a believable, Olympic boxer took \u201cmonths and months of training with a boxing trainer who was incredible and treated me like a fighter and not an actor,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that really put me in the mindset more of an actual boxer in understanding the craft and the sport.\u201d",
      "Then there was the work of embodying Shields as a person. A 2015 documentary about Shields, \u201cT-Rex,\u201d provided the actor \u201ca front-row seat\u201d to Shields\u2019 life, her relationship with Crutchfield and her journey to the Olympics.",
      "\u201cI studied it really hard to try to learn a lot of things \u2014 her mannerisms, the way she would talk, the way she would walk, the way she would fight, the way she would interact with her mom, interact with her siblings \u2014 and I think it really, really helped me,\u201d Destiny said.",
      "Shields herself told NBC News she was impressed by Destiny\u2019s portrayal. \u201cI\u2019m happy she understood the calling and understood her role and who she was in the film,\u201d Shields said. \u201cI\u2019m happy that she was able to include that confidence, show that grit.\u201d",
      "Shields said she was impressed by Destiny and Brian Tyree Henry\u2019s portrayal of her relationship with Crutchfield. \u201cThey got the relationship between me and Jason right,\u201d she said. \u201cJason was like my best friend, mentor, my coach, my dad, and they were able to exude all of that in the film.\u201d",
      "Shining a spotlight on coaches like Crutchfield and many other Black men like him in other urban communities was critical to Jenkins, who once was a high school and college athlete.",
      "\u201cI felt like it was a story that I hadn\u2019t seen told very often, even though I had seen that story in my everyday life,\u201d Jenkins, who also directed \u201cMufasa,\u201d told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhere I\u2019m from in Miami, there are all these athletes being raised in some ways by these coaches who themselves are just working-class, working poor, the same way these athletes are,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s this really great sacrifice that\u2019s constantly happening with all of these communities all over America.\u201d",
      "Shields wanted Jenkins to hit several key points in his script when they initially met, prior to the release of his Oscar-winning 2016 film \u201cMoonlight,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBoxing is very physical, but I wanted him to catch the mental part,\u201d Shields said. \u201cAnd I wanted him to also not leave out the part that I believe in God.\u201d",
      "She also emphasized to Jenkins how she wanted the film to correct one critical depiction of her in the media. \u201cPeople have written so many articles about me being an angry Black woman, but I let him know how I\u2019m not angry to be a boxer. I love boxing. I\u2019m passionate about it,\u201d she said.",
      "And she also did not want to be portrayed as a victim. \u201cI wanted my hard times to show,\u201d Shields said. \u201cI wanted [people] to see what I went through, but I don\u2019t want nobody feeling sorry for me.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "My baptism into the hidden epidemic of wrongful convictions came more than two decades ago when a Bronx detective confided that he knew two men languishing in prison for the 1990 murder of a Manhattan nightclub bouncer were innocent. How could he be so sure? \u201cBecause I know who did it,\u201d he said.",
      "It was a conversation that changed my life \u2014 and gave me new purpose as a journalist.",
      "As a producer for NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d for nearly 30 years, I\u2019ve been immersed in every aspect of the justice system. I\u2019ve spent years embedding with detectives, prosecutors and defense attorneys. I\u2019ve heard indelible stories from countless victims of crime. I\u2019ve interviewed a host of judges, jurors and people condemned to death. And I\u2019ve spent hundreds of days inside prisons.",
      "My decades of reporting helped free six innocent men.",
      "My prolonged proximity to all the facets of our justice system has spotlighted one inescapable issue \u2014 the disturbing frequency with which innocent people are sent to prison and the staggering difficulty of rectifying that injustice, even when it is obvious.",
      "Statistics underscore this grim reality. No one knows how many innocent people are in prison, but Barry Scheck, a co-founder of the Innocence Project, believes that the most realistic studies indicate at least 100,000 of the nearly 2 million people locked up across America could be wrongfully convicted. But, in a span of 30 years, only 3,500 people have been exonerated.",
      "We know the biggest contributors to wrongful convictions: Unreliable eyewitnesses. False confessions, often extracted under duress. Ineffective defense attorneys. Witnesses with incentives to lie. Police and prosecutorial misconduct. Junk forensic science.",
      "These problems feature prominently in the plight of the six freed men whose cases I investigated over two decades, as featured in my recent book, \u201cThe Sing Sing Files,\u201d and in the NBC News Studios docuseries \u201cThe Sing Sing Chronicles.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Jon-Adrian \u201cJJ\u201d Velazquez, sentenced to 25 years to life for the 1998 murder of a retired policeman in Harlem. The case against him was built on eyewitness identification; not a shred of physical or forensic evidence linked him to the scene. He even had two alibi witnesses. My 20-year investigation revealed a pattern of questionable police and prosecutorial tactics, as well as two eyewitnesses who recanted and critical evidence his attorneys never saw before his trial. He served nearly 24 years.",
      "\u2014 David Lemus and Olmedo Hidalgo, each sentenced to 25 years to life for the 1990 murder of a Manhattan nightclub bouncer. The two men had never met. The case against them relied mainly on eyewitness identification. My investigation uncovered new evidence and misconduct, and sparked a court hearing. I also interviewed the actual gunman, which caused key eyewitnesses to acknowledge they were wrong. Each man served 15 years.",
      "\u2014 Eric Glisson, sentenced to 25 years to life for the 1995 murder of a cabdriver in the Bronx.

He was imprisoned for nearly 18 years.",
      "\u2014 Johnny Hincapie, sentenced to 25 years to life for the 1990 robbery and murder of a tourist from Utah on a subway platform in Manhattan. His conviction was based on a false, coerced confession he gave when he was 17 years old. He spent 25 years behind bars.",
      "\u2014 Richard Rosario, sentenced to 25 years to life for the 1996 murder of a teenager in the Bronx.

Authorities \u2014 and his trial attorneys \u2014 didn\u2019t follow up with those witnesses, who included a police officer, a federal corrections officer and a pastor. I interviewed most of them, ultimately leading to his release. He served 20 years.",
      "Through my work, I\u2019ve come to understand the deeper pathology of mass incarceration. We have created a false narrative that stokes demands for politicians to be \u201ctough on crime,\u201d but the result too often has undermined public safety rather than enhanced it.",
      "Consider the astonishingly high recidivism rates for people who have done time. Roughly 70% of people released from prison are rearrested within three years, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Yet even though studies have found that prison education programs reduce recidivism by almost 45%, funding for such programs remains woefully inadequate \u2014 and some facilities offer no educational opportunities at all.",
      "And while the use of solitary confinement often is justified as a necessary tool for discipline and safety, studies have shown that prolonged isolation increases rates of violence and mental illness, which significantly affect rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Still, tens of thousands of people in the United States are subjected to solitary confinement every day, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit organization that focuses on criminal justice reform.",
      "There is little public outcry to improve prison conditions when people remain convinced that crime is epidemic: Year after year, they tell pollsters it\u2019s more violent than it has ever been. But the reality is that for more than 15 years, the United States has seen a remarkable trend \u2014 all but five states have reduced most crime rates.",
      "Even for those accused of petty offenses, the system often wreaks havoc. People can lose their jobs, their homes and their children. And even winning release from prison in those rare cases doesn\u2019t spell total freedom.",
      "In August 2021, New York\u2019s governor granted JJ Velazquez clemency, reducing his sentence and allowing him to go home after he had spent almost a quarter-century in a cell.

      "President-elect Donald Trump backed House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in his campaign to hold on to the gavel, writing Monday on his social media platform that Johnson has his \u201cComplete & Total Endorsement.\u201d",
      "\u201cSpeaker Mike John\u00adson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump, who will begin his second term on Jan. 20 with plans for a sweeping reform agenda focused on immigration and other priorities, urged his party to stick together heading into 2025. \u201cLETS NOT BLOW THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY WHICH WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Johnson responded, promising to \u201cquickly deliver\u201d on Trump\u2019s agenda. The speaker\u2019s election is Friday when the new Congress begins.\u00a0Days later, on Jan. 6, the new Congress is set to certify Trump's victory in the election.",
      "Trump\u2019s statement follows recent warnings that Johnson could face defections within his party in Friday's vote for speaker. He can afford to lose only a handful of Republican votes, given Republicans' slim House majority. Republicans won a razor-thin House majority in November with 220 seats. Since then, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has stepped down to pursue a Cabinet nomination, from which he later withdrew, bringing the number of House Republicans to 219.",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., announced last week that he would not support Johnson\u2019s re-election. \u201cI\u2019m not persuaded by the \u2018hurry up and elect him so we can certify the election on J6\u2019 argument,\u201d Massie said on X. \u201cA weak legislative branch, beholden to the swamp, will not be able to achieve the mandate voters gave Trump and Congress in November.\u201d",
      "Support for Johnson among some Republican members appeared to falter amid his efforts to push through a bipartisan end-of-year spending deal that was ripped apart by billionaire Elon Musk, a close Trump ally. Republicans voted against the plan and then voted down a slimmed-down agreement that included a demand by Trump to raise the debt ceiling, though the true deadline to lift the country\u2019s borrowing limit is not likely to come until the middle of next year.",
      "Johnson ultimately oversaw passage of a deal that did not include Trump\u2019s provision to raise the debt ceiling and angered some conservatives over its lack of spending cuts.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest statement follows a show of support Sunday from Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who argued that Johnson inherited those circumstances from former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who was ousted by a group of eight Republicans.",
      "Lawler said in an interview with ABC News that Johnson \u201cinherited a disaster\u201d and that the removal of McCarthy \u201cwill go down as the single stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in politics.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith that said, removing Mike Johnson would equally be as stupid,\u201d Lawler said on \"This Week.\" \u201cThe fact is that these folks are playing with fire, and if they think they\u2019re somehow going to get a more conservative speaker, they\u2019re kidding themselves.\u201d",
      "NBC News has reported that Trump expressed support for Johnson in November in a meeting with House Republicans, according to GOP sources. But he appeared to waver on his support shortly after he denounced the bipartisan government funding deal Johnson released this month.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Trump responded on Dec. 19 when he was asked whether he still had confidence in Johnson.",
      "Trump's statement Monday may tamp down rumblings inside the House that Republicans should search for an alternative to Johnson.",
      "Soon after Trump shared his endorsement, Musk responded to Johnson on X to offer his \"full support.\"",
      "Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., who earlier sent a letter to Johnson asking for some commitments before she could vote for him for speaker, indicated that she was not swayed by Trump's endorsement alone.",
      "\u201cI understand why President Trump is endorsing Speaker Johnson as he did Speaker Ryan, which is definitely important,\u201d Spartz wrote on X, referring to former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., whose re-election for speaker Trump backed during his first term. \u201cHowever, we still need to get assurances that @SpeakerJohnson won\u2019t sell us out to the swamp.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court has upheld writer E. Jean Carroll's $5 million civil judgment against President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "A jury awarded Carroll the sum last year after it found Trump liable for sexual abusing her in the 1990s and then defaming her after she went public with her allegations.",
      "Trump has denied the allegations and appealed the verdict, charging it was \"grossly excessive\" and saying it should be tossed out because of what he claimed were unfair rulings by the judge who presided over the nine-day trial.",
      "A panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed.",
      "\"We conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings. Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial,\" the judges' ruling said.",
      "Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, said in response to the ruling: \u201cThe American People have re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed.\"",
      "Carroll attorney Roberta Kaplan said in a statement that she and her client \u201care gratified by today\u2019s decision.\u00a0We thank the Second Circuit for its careful consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments.\u201d",
      "Carroll later posted a link to a news story about the ruling on Facebook, adding, \"Thank you, Robbie Kaplan!\"",
      "Carroll's suit alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store in 1996 and that he defamed her by calling her claim a \"hoax\" and a \"con job\" after he left office in 2021.",
      "Trump did not testify or put on a defense case. His appeal focused on what he said were critical errors by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, including allowing testimony from two other women who claimed they had been sexually accosted by Trump.",
      "Jessica Leeds alleged that Trump started to grope her out of the blue while they were sitting next to each other on a flight to New York in the late 1970s, while\u00a0Natasha Stoynoff\u00a0testified that Trump pushed her against a wall and started kissing her in 2005, when she was at his Mar-a-Lago resort to interview him and Melania Trump for a story about their first wedding anniversary. Trump has denied their allegations.",
      "His attorneys also cited Kaplan's decision to allow the jury to hear the so-called \"Access Hollywood\" tape as another error. The 2005 recording caught Trump on a hot mic bragging that he can grope women without their consent because \"when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\"",
      "The appeals court found Judge Kaplan had not \"abused his discretion\" by letting that evidence into the case. The \"evidence of other conduct was relevant to show a pattern tending to directly corroborate witness testimony and to confirm that\u00a0the alleged sexual assault actually occurred,\" the ruling said.",
      "Trump is also appealing Carroll's $83 million defamation judgment against him in a separate but related case centering on defamatory comments he made about her while he was president and then after the $5 million verdict.",
      "That case was actually the first suit she filed against Trump, but it was stalled while Trump argued that his comments were protected by presidential immunity, a claim the judge rejected.",
      "Trump is appealing that verdict to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, as well."

      "Welcome to the final From the Politics Desk newsletter of the year, where we look ahead to the major storylines that will shape Washington and beyond in 2025. (Check out our recap of the dynamics that defined 2024 here.) We\u2019ll be back on Friday, Jan. 3.",

      "5 big storylines that will shape 2025",
      "With the new Congress getting underway on Jan. 3, and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s term starting Jan. 20, here are five big storylines to watch in the new year.",
      "For Mike Johnson, getting re-elected as House speaker on Jan. 3, if he manages it, may be the easy part. Next, he\u2019ll have to navigate a series of difficult tasks with a wafer-thin House majority: another round of government funding on March 14, a debt limit deadline and a major party-line bill (perhaps two) to advance Trump\u2019s agenda on immigration, border security, energy and tax cuts. It will be a daunting challenge, particularly for a speaker who leapt out of nowhere to take over the job just 14 months ago. Johnson, who won Trump\u2019s endorsement\u00a0to remain speaker on Monday, is about to face the most consequential stretch of his career.",
      "For the first time in 18 years, Senate Republicans will have a new leader, with John Thune taking the reins from Mitch McConnell. Will Thune\u2019s leadership style be similar or different?\u00a0McConnell built his power by gaining a deep understanding of his conference and following its wishes. On what issues, if any, will Thune say no to Trump, and how?",
      "There are early indications that Democrats, burned by their failures in 2024, want to deal with Trump differently than they did in his first term. Fewer freakouts about his social media posts and cultural taunts; more focus on the economic issues that caused voters to swing against them. It\u2019s notable that some Democrats\u2019 harshest criticism of Trump after the election came when he said it would be \u201chard\u201d to lower grocery prices. But whether Democrats will have the discipline to stay focused on kitchen-table issues remains to be seen.",
      "The congressional class of 2025 will bring a new cast of characters for both parties. For Republicans on Capitol Hill, currency will equal proximity to Trump\u2019s White House, the power to advance his agenda, and the ability to go viral on conservative media. For Democrats, the question is who will be the face of the second resistance? They spent the last days of 2024 portraying Trump as a puppet of billionaires like Elon Musk and demanding a debt limit hike to grease the wheels for giving Tump another tax cut bill.",
      "After running on an agenda of retribution against perceived political foes, Trump said this month in an interview with \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he wants to turn the page. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. Retribution will be through success,\u201d he said. But his actions tell a different story. He has already pursued legal action against media entities like ABC News and an Iowa pollster before taking office. On Capitol Hill, he\u2019ll have allies in power places, with committee chairmanships and subpoena power to investigate. Will they use their power to settle scores for Trump?",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 19:52:14 GMT",
    "summary": "After the premiere of the second season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cSquid Game,\u201d viewers are criticizing the show\u2019s decision to cast a straight cisgender male actor as a trans character Hyun-ju.",
    "story": [
      "After the sophomore-season premiere of Netflix\u2019s wildly popular thriller series \u201cSquid Game,\u201d many viewers are criticizing the South Korean show for casting a straight, cisgender male actor as a transgender woman contestant\u00a0in the deadly games.",
      "The new season, which debuted Thursday, features actor Park Sung-hoon, known for playing villains in the television series \u201cThe Glory\u201d and \u201cQueen of Tears,\u201d as Hyun-ju, a contestant who enters the high-stakes game in hopes of using her winnings to pay for her gender-affirming surgery.",
      "While some viewers speculated that the storyline could help bring attention to the trans community \u2014 which is\u00a0marginalized in Korean society and underrepresented in the country\u2019s\u00a0entertainment industry \u2014 others said the series missed the mark by not having a trans actor in the role.",
      "\u201cNetflix squid games 2 didn\u2019t hit the same bc they hired a straight guy to play this character,\u201d one viewer posted on X. \u201cFelt forced instead of organic.\u201d",
      "Neither \u201cSquid Game\u201d creator Hwang Dong-hyuk nor Park responded to NBC News\u2019 request for comment. Netflix confirmed that the show did work with trans and LGBTQ consultants while creating the second season, but in an interview with TV Guide, Hwang said it was \u201cnear impossible\u201d to find a trans actor for the role.",
      "\u201cWhen we researched in Korea, there are close to no actors that are openly trans, let alone openly gay,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cUnfortunately in the Korean society currently the LGBTQ community is rather still marginalized and more neglected, which is heartbreaking.\u201d",
      "The second season once again revolves around Player 456, whose real name is Gi-hun, as he re-enters the game three years after his initial victory. This time, he\u2019s come with the sole purpose of putting an end to it and protecting his fellow players from violence and death.",
      "Among the contestants is Hyun-ju, a former Special Forces soldier who becomes increasingly valuable to her fellow players as both an emotional rock and a competitive force. In one scene, Hyun-ju explains why she wants to stick with the game rather than opt out, revealing to the others that once she started her gender transition, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy mom cried a lot. And my father stopped talking to me. I got fired from my job, and lost all my friends,\u201d Hyun-ju says, explaining that, with the winnings, she\u2019ll move to Thailand, finish her transition and start a new life. \u201cI wasn\u2019t done with the treatment and the procedures. but I wasn\u2019t earning any money so my debt kept piling up. Although I felt liberated, my life became so much harder.\u201d",
      "Park described Hyun-ju as a character who, in spite of the prejudice and difficulty she\u2019s had to face, continues to show \u201cincredible strength, decisiveness and natural leadership.\u201d",
      "\u201cThrough her resilience, she breaks down stereotypes and shines as an inspiring character,\u201d Park said.",
      "While Hwang said he had \u201ccomplete trust\u201d in Park to portray the character well, critics argued that proper representation involves more than just talent \u2014 it\u2019s also about trans visibility.",
      "\u201cThe fact that a man is acting as the trans woman in squid game doesn\u2019t sit right with me,\u201d another X user posted. \u201cI get they\u2019re trying to be inclusive but just hire a real trans woman or a woman.\u201d",
      "John Cho, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of British Columbia, who specializes in gender and sexuality and queer studies, explained that for many racial and sexual minorities, the casting of a cisgender man in one of the rare transgender roles in Korea can be viewed as a \u201cslap in the face.\u201d He also said it exposed a glaring disparity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like you have hundreds of trans actors or actresses representing cisgender characters,\u201d Cho said. \u201cThere are these historically embedded structural inequalities in terms of access to representation.\u201d",
      "While highlighting a trans storyline could be a positive step forward, he added,\u00a0\u201ctrans people and queer people in general have historically and still continue to be denied visibility as citizens.\u201d",
      "Cho said the issue can\u2019t be examined without looking into the real disparities that have existed for the queer community in Korea. In a poll of South Korean LGBTQ youth that was included in a 2021 Human Rights Watch report, 96% of respondents said they experienced discrimination or bullying in school. The report also referenced a 2014 poll by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea which showed 80% of LGBTQ youth reported receiving discriminatory comments from teachers.",
      "One potential reason for this, Cho said, is that over the years, the country has attempted to establish itself as a nation state with its military and the reinforcement of traditional masculinity standards. In 2021, a trans soldier, Staff Sgt. Byun Hui-su, died by suicide after being dismissed from the military. She had wanted to transfer to the military\u2019s female corps after undergoing gender-affirming surgery but was deemed \u201cdisabled\u201d and unfit for service due to the surgery. Months after her death, the Daejeon District Court ordered the army to recognize her as a woman and annul her dismissal in a posthumous win.",
      "\u201cThis controversy is important because it\u2019s starting conversations,\u201d Cho said. \u201cBut these conversations need to be much more expanded and complicated so we\u2019re not stuck.\u201d"

      "Chalamet ultimately sang and performed over 40 songs for the movie.",
      "\u201cIt was important for me to sing and play live. Because if I can actually do it, why should there be an element of artifice here? And I\u2019m proud that we took that leap,\u201d Chalamet said in a featurette released ahead of the premiere.",
      "Here's what to know about how Chalamet became Dylan.",
      "Is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet singing in 'A Complete Unknown'?",

      "Chalamet did originally pre-record Dylan's vocals, revealed Mangold, but the actor wanted to take a stab as performing live in character during an early scene depicting Dylan and Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy).",
      "\u201cWe shot that in the first five or six days,\u201d Mangold recalled. \u201cAnd there was a whole backstage thing with Timmy saying, \u2018I want to try it live.\u2019\u201d",

      "But he opted to allow Chalamet to give it a shot. \u201cAnd he was phenomenal. Not only that, he proved the brilliance of the method,\u201d said the director.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this moment where he finishes that song and he holds a note and just keeps hitting the low string on the guitar over and over again, and he\u2019s just his eyes are kind of boring into Woody, and he\u2019s just holding this note, and it gave him chills,\" Mangold recalled.",
      "\u201cI remember sitting there eight feet from him as he did it, and I remember thinking, \u2018Holy s---.\u2019 That could not have happened if there was an earwig in his ear,\" he added.",
      "Tod Maitland, the movie's sound mixer, told Variety that the biggest musical challenge for Chalamet was varying his vocal stylings to match Dylan's during specific performances.",
      "\"Bob\u2019s a mutterer, and Timmy gave his best mutter, so it was pulling that out. He would go from there to that twangy, tough voice that could shrill your eardrums,\" Maitland said. \"But there were, like four different voices inside of Timmy capturing all those and giving them all character was a whole other dimension.\u201d",
      "Though \"A Complete Unknown\" doesn't show Chalamet singing entire songs, each song was filmed \u201cfrom top to tail,\u201d Ted Caplan, the movie's supervising music editor, said.",
      "Chalamet even performed the entire set of Dylan's landmark 1965 Newport Folk Festival performance, which saw him swap his acoustic guitar for an electric one, much to folk music fans' disapproval.",
      "\u201cThat was recorded as a full concert; from the Hammer song to \u2018Baby Blue,\u2019 it was one run,\u201d Caplan said, adding, \u201cI think it gave it a special live real magic.",

      "\u201cDylan\u2019s guitar playing is so unique; it\u2019s sort of messy and violent but also incredibly technically advanced, too. He\u2019s a great player. When you hear some of these early recordings, you can tell he\u2019d been playing guitar all the time, for many years. The technique is there, the playing is there, but there\u2019s a rawness to it. If you don\u2019t capture that, it sounds wrong immediately,\u201d he said.",

      "Well, it's that time of year again, time for one... more ... game.",
      "Netflix's hit show \"Squid Game\" released its highly anticipated second season on Dec. 26, which consisted of seven episodes.",
      "The second season flashes forward a few years after Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a.k.a. Player 456, won the games. The trauma of everyone's death from Season 1 still weighs heavily on Gi-hun's conscience, causing him to devote himself and the $45.6 billion won (about $31 million dollars) he won to finding and ending the games once and for all.",
      "However, Gi-hun's plans go astray, causing him to be thrown back into the games once more with an entire new set of players.",
      "This time, the twist is that the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) who orchestrated all the games during Season 1 decided to enter the games himself, posing as Young-il, Player 001. The Front Man, whose real name is In-Ho, is a former winner of the games.",
      "Gi-hun, who once again plays as Player 456, makes his way through the games, beginning (like Season 1) with Red Light, Green Light, but adding in two new games afterwards: Pentathlon and Mingle.",
      "This season adds the twist that after each round, all players vote to decide if they want to continue the games or end them there.",
      "As the season progresses, Young-il (the Front Man in disguise) befriends Gi-hun, gaining his trust by explaining his own tragic backstory. He says his pregnant wife is dying and he joined the games to get the money to save her and his unborn child. However, viewers know the Front Man's wife already has died.",
      "This duo forms an alliance with other characters, including Gi-hun's best friend from Season 1 Park Jung-bae (Lee Seo-hwan) who is also a competitor this season and ex-marine Dae-ho (Kang Ha-neul).",
      "Season 2 also introduces new players like mother and son duo Park Yong-sik (Yang Dong-geun) and Jang Geum-ja (Kang Ae-sim), crypto currency influencer Lee Myung-gi (Yim Si-wan), pregnant player Kim Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri) and rapper Thanos (Choi Seung-hyun), amongst others.",
      "Outside of the games, Detective Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun), who Front Man seemingly shot and killed in the Season 1 finale, is actually alive. He's recovered and now independently searching for the island with the help of the boat captain who rescued him as the police don't believe his story about the games being real.",
      "How does the season end and where is the third, and what seems to be the final, season headed?",
      "Season 2's ending explained",
      "As Gi-hun fights within the games to end them and keep as many people alive as possible, Jun-ho searches for the island with the help of allies Gi-hun enlisted before entering the games a second time.",
      "However, the captain of the boat who has been assisting Jun-ho in finding the island is revealed to be secretly tampering with their search.",
      "By the end of the season, Jun-ho has no luck finding the island and has yet to realize that the boat's captain is actually working to keep the games hidden.",
      "Within the games, the finale begins in the middle of a bloody fight between players. At this point, voting has split the remaining 100 players in half, with half wanting to stay and keep playing the games and half wanting to end the games. With a second vote scheduled for the next day, participants have resorted to killing other players who don't agree with their vote to strengthen their chances of the vote going their way.",
      "Gi-hun, meanwhile, has devised a plan to infiltrate the masked spectators' headquarters to put a stop to the games altogether and, in his words, \"make them pay.\"",
      "His convinces his friends to hide during the chaos instead of fighting to defend others on their side \u2014 which, as Young-il makes him say, shows he's willing to \"sacrifice a few for the good of the rest.\"",
      "While this is a new side to Gi-hun's character, whose goal has been to shed as little blood as possible, he decides a few more lives lost is worth it to end the games once and for all.",
      "When the guards come in to break up the fight, Gi-hun and his friends, who were playing dead, jump the guards and grab their guns, killing all but one in the process.",
      "Gi-hun instructs the surviving guard to bring them to his captain. The rebel crew shoot out the cameras before continuing on through the island fortress.",
      "The Front Man, still pretending to be the friendly Young-il, joins the riot and follows Gi-hun.",
      "The group is intercepted by gun fire before they can reach the game makers. Most of the final episode includes Gi-hun and his rebels fighting back against the pink-suited workers.",
      "Sadly, the rebellion fails, despite some moments of bravery from Hyun-ju who reveals she was in Special Forces before joining the games. They have too little ammo and end up being outnumbered.",
      "While Gi-hun and Jung-bae make it further than most of their crew, they ultimately end up failing when Young-il turns on them.",
      "Young-il splits up from Gi-hun, claiming he saw another way up to where the masked men are shooting down as Gi-hun and Jung-bae. However, when he goes that way, he ends up killing the two players he brought with him and sends a final radio message to Gi-hun pretending that he failed and died.",
      "He then dons the Front Man's classic outfit from Season 1, a long gray coat and black mask. As Gi-hun and Jung-bae surrender (clearly outnumbered), the Front Man slowly descends down the steps to them and, through a voice modulator, asks Gi-hun, \"Did you have fun playing the hero?\"",
      "\"Look closely at the consequences of your little hero game,\" he says as he turns his loaded gun towards Jung-bae, killing him instantly.",
      "Gi-hun tries to fight back but is wrestled to the ground by pink suited workers as the Front Man (whom Gi-hun still doesn't know is Young-il) walks away.",
      "The show fades to black on Gi-hun screaming with grief as his head is pushed into the ground, forcing him to look at Jung-bae and the pool of blood spilling from him.",
      "What does the post-credit scene mean for Season 3?",
      "The post-credit scene is a brief clip of players walking up to the motion sensor doll from Red Light, Green Light. This time, there's a second gigantic doll across from the original one.",
      "The quick scene ends as the light turns from red to green, hinting that the games continue in some form after the failed coup.",
      "Show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk \"originally envisioned seasons 2 and 3 as a single story,\" he told Entertainment Weekly.",
      "\"That\u2019s how I wrote it,\" he told the outlet. \"But in the process, it came out to be too many episodes. So, I thought it\u2019d be better to divide it into two.\"",

      "A major investigation was underway Monday after 179 people were killed in one of South Korea's deadliest plane crashes ever when an airliner belly-landed at Muan International Airport on Sunday before skidding into a wall and bursting into flames.",
      "Questions remain around exactly what caused Jeju Air Flight 2216 to crash \u2014 and why the death toll was so high, with just two survivors.",
      "Hundreds of family members camped out overnight at the international airport, desperate for answers about what happened to their loved ones and demanding to be able to see their remains.",
      "Here's what we know so far about the deadly crash and the investigation into what caused it:",
      "What happened?",
      "Jeju Air Flight 2216 took off from Bangkok shortly after 2 a.m. local time (2 p.m. ET Saturday), according to the flight-tracking platform FlightAware.",
      "Around 8:59 a.m. (6:59 pm ET Saturday), the pilot of the Boeing 737-800 plane issued a \"bird strike\" warning used to alert a collision between at least one bird and an aircraft, before declaring \"mayday,\"  Yu Kyung-soo, director of aviation safety policy at South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, or MOLIT, said in a briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cThe aircraft then performed a go-around, and at 9:01 a.m., it was cleared to enter Runway 19,\" Yu said. Just a minute later, the plane touched down at the one-third point, or almost 4,000 feet, of the runway, he said. But after about one minute, it veered off the runway and collided with a wall, Yu said.",
      "The incident unfolded just minutes after the control tower at the airport had issued a bird activity warning at 8:57 a.m., Yu added.",
      "In video captured of the crash, the plane could be seen belly-landing at Muan International Airport and skidding down the runway before crashing into a wall and erupting in flames. Video appeared to show that part or all of the aircraft's landing gear did not deploy.",
      "South Korea\u2019s national fire agency confirmed that 179 people were killed in the crash, making it the deadliest airline disaster of the year and what appeared to be Jeju Air\u2019s first fatal accident since the low-cost airline was founded in 2005.",
      "What caused the crash?",
      "There is still no definitive answer on what exactly caused the crash.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board is expected to dispatch a U.S. investigation team to assist with the probe, with consultations also ongoing with Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, and CFM International, a joint venture between the United States and France that manufactured the plane's engine, officials said at a briefing Monday.",
      "Two black boxes retrieved from the aircraft \u2014 the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder \u2014 were transferred to a test center Monday morning.",
      "Investigators are looking into whether a flock or a single bird was responsible for the plane\u2019s apparent loss of control.",
      "It also unclear why the plane's landing gear did not appear to deploy.",
      "According to an analysis by Cirium, an aviation analytics firm, there are 4,387 Boeing 737-800 in service across the world.",
      "On Monday, a different Boeing 737-800 plane operated by Jeju Air had to return to Seoul\u2019s Gimpo International Airport not long after takeoff after the pilot detected a landing gear issue.",
      "Song Kyung-hoon, a Jeju Air executive, said the issue had been resolved during the flight, but that the pilot still returned to Gimpo as a precautionary measure, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Another aspect of the crash that investigators will be looking into is the fact that the plane crashed into the exterior wall of an azimuth, or localizer, facility, Joo Jong-wan, director of the aviation policy office at MOLIT, said at a briefing Monday.",
      "\"The azimuth facility cannot be arbitrarily installed; there are installation regulations, which we are currently reviewing,\" Joo said.",
      "Investigators will also be looking into whether the localizer, which includes a concrete fence surrounding a set of antennas designed to help guide aircraft during landings, should have been made with materials that would have broken more easily upon impact, AP reported.",
      "What we know about the victims",
      "A total of 181 passengers, including young children, and crew members were onboard when the plane crashed.",
      "Most of the passengers are believed to have been Korean, but at least two of were Thai,\u00a0Joo said.",
      "At least 84 of the dead were women and 82 were men, officials said.",
      "At least 11 of those killed were school students, South Korea's Education Ministry said Monday. At least four were enrolled in elementary school, three in middle school and four in high school.",
      "\"One victim was identified as a preschool child born in 2021 and attending daycare,\" ministry spokesperson Gu Yeon-hee said.",
      "Grieving family members of those killed in the crash have gathered at Muan airport demanding answers and to see the bodies of their loved ones.",
      "The families have formed a group led by Park Han-shin, who lost his brother in the crash.",
      "On Monday, Park issued a number of demands on behalf of the families, including that Jeju Air cover the costs of funeral services for those killed and that a memorial be set up for the victims inside the airport.",
      "The Seoul city government said Monday that it will set up a joint memorial altar for the victims and minimize or cancel year-end events during the national mourning period.",
      "Park also said that more freezer containers were needed at the airport  to preserve crash victims. A lack of storage for bodies is a growing concern among the grieving families.",
      "Finally, Park said, the families would need answers on what exactly happened to their loved ones, as well as compensation for their loss.",
      "\"You need to clearly establish what went wrong, why it went wrong, and allocate appropriate compensation and procedures accordingly,\" he said.",
      "The survivors",
      "Two people, a man and a woman who were both flight crew members, survived Sunday's crash. Both suffered moderate injuries, but were conscious, Joo said.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency identified one of the survivors as a 33-year-old flight attendant who suffered multiple injuries, including fractured ribs and traumatic spinal injuries, according to Ju Woong, director of Ewha Woman\u2019s University Seoul Hospital.",
      "\u201cWhen I woke up, I had already been rescued,\u201d\u00a0said the flight attendant, identified only by his last name, Lee, according to Ju. They were in intensive care but able to communicate well.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no indication yet of memory loss or such,\u201d Ju said.",
      "New safety measures",
      "Officials have already announced plans for new safety measures.",
      "A special investigation of the Boeing  B737-800 aircraft model would be launched, MOLIT said Monday.",
      "The aircraft model is widely used by domestic low-cost carriers, with Jeju Air operating the largest number at 39 planes. Other operators include T\u2019way Air, Jin Air, Eastar Jet, Air Incheon and Korean Air.",
      "\u201cWe will examine compliance with various regulations, including operational records, inspections, and maintenance conducted before and after flights,\" Joo said.",
      "He said a review into bird strikes and regulations aimed at reducing such incidents would also be undertaken.",
      "\"For new airport projects, we will thoroughly examine bird strike issues and develop supplementary measures with experts,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cThe essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,\u201d the country's new acting president, Choi Sang-mok, said Monday."

The street is strewn with rubble and the buildings around him appear destroyed, the video shared widely on social media shows.",
      "While it isn't clear exactly when the video was shot, the Israeli military confirmed Monday that it had detained and interrogated Abu Safiya. He was being held as a \"suspect\" and being questioned over \"potential involvement in terrorist activity,\" IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said in a post on X.",
      "Before his detention, Abu Safiya, a pediatrician, repeatedly warned about the IDF's raid on the hospital and how it endangered patients, including premature babies.",
      "On Friday, he posted video on his Instagram account showing a quadcopter dropping a bomb a few yards from Kamal Adwan Hospital, with the bomb exploding with a loud bang before sending plumes of smoke into the air.",
      "On Friday, video geolocated by NBC News to the area around the hospital showed a crowd of men stripped down to minimal clothing walking in a line with their hands raised. Separately, NBC News' crew on the ground in Gaza captured video of a blaze tearing through several units at the hospital on the same day. In it, people could be seen racing to try to douse the flames with buckets of water, while others sifted through the rubble.",
      "Shoshani previously said there was no connection between the fire and the IDF's activities at the site.",
      "Since Friday, there has been no sign of Abu Safiya, with international organizations, including the World Health Organization, sounding the alarm and demanding his release.",
      "\"Hospitals in Gaza have once again become battlegrounds and the health system is under severe threat,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday in a statement on X, adding that Kamal Adwan was forced to go out of service following the IDF's raid.",

      "Hospitals and medical workers are considered protected under international law, which states that they must never become targets in warfare.",
      "The IDF did not immediately respond to questions about Abu Safiya's whereabouts, condition or any possible charges against him.",
      "The IDF alleged that Kamal Adwan had been used as a \"Hamas command center.\" More than 240 people were detained over the weekend, all of them \"terrorists,\" it added in a statement.",
      "Sharing a photo of Abu Safiya, over the weekend, the international human rights group Amnesty International said it was \"extremely concerned over the fate & wellbeing\" of the medical director.",
      "\"He must be released immediately and unconditionally,\" the organization said in a statement posted on X.",
      "Ghebreyesus said critical patients had been moved out of Kamal Adwan to the nearby Indonesian Hospital, which he noted was \"itself out of function.\"",
      "He said WHO workers on the ground and partnering groups were able to deliver basic medical and hygiene supplies, as well as water Monday to the Indonesian Hospital, in addition to transferring 10 critical patients to Al-Shifa Hospital, which has been heavily bombed and raided by Israeli forces repeatedly throughout the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "But Ghebreyesus said that at least four patients were detained during WHO's efforts. \"We urge Israel to ensure their health care needs and rights are upheld,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, the WHO director-general noted that multiple other hospitals in Gaza had also been attacked over the past several days.",
      "The IDF has repeatedly said that hospitals and other civilian infrastructure are being exploited by Hamas and used as military sites, and frequently targeted the facilities during the more than a yearlong offensive in the enclave.",
      "Local health officials vehemently dispute claims that medical centers are used by Hamas or other militants.",
      "Israeli forces' repeated attacks on hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza have left the enclave's health care system decimated amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis, with most facilities damaged or destroyed in Israel's more than a yearlong military offensive.",
      "\"If a hospital has been reduced to a bombed-out shell, it would cease to be protected, but otherwise a hospital, whether immediately used or not, is presumptively protected as an important civilian institution,\" Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, previously told NBC News. \"It can be attacked only if actively used for military purposes, and even then, only if the civilian harm is not disproportionate.\"",
      "The Illinois-based nonprofit organization MedGlobal was also among those to condemn the IDF's attack on Kamal Adwan Hospital, calling it a \"brutal violation of a protected medical space\" as it echoed calls for Abu Safiya's release.",
      "\"Dr. Abu Safiya and his team constitute the lifeline of healthcare provision in northern Gaza,\" Rajaa Musleh, MedGlobal\u2019s Gaza country director, said in a statement.",
      "More than 45,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israeli forces launched their offensive in the enclave after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attack, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict."

      "BERLIN\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Billionaire\u00a0Elon\u00a0Musk\u00a0is trying to exert influence over the German election\u00a0taking place in February, a government spokesperson said on Monday.",
      "\u201cIt is indeed the case that\u00a0Elon\u00a0Musk\u00a0is trying to influence the federal election,\u201d with X posts and an opinion piece he wrote backing the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) over the weekend, she said.",
      "Musk\u00a0was free to express his opinion, the spokesperson added. \u201cAfter all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.\u201d",
      "The support of the AfD from\u00a0Musk, who is set to serve U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration as an outside adviser, comes as Germans are set to vote on Feb. 23 after a coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed.",
      "The commentary published in German in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, flagship of the Axel Springer media group, expanded on a post by\u00a0Musk\u00a0on social media platform X last week in which he wrote \u201conly the AfD can save Germany\u201d and praised the party\u2019s approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation.",
      "In response to the publication of his commentary, the editor of the newspaper\u2019s opinion section said on X that she had resigned.",
      "Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats and current favorite to succeed Scholz as chancellor, said in an interview with the Funke Media Group: \u201cI cannot recall a comparable case of interference, in the history of Western democracies, in the election campaign of a friendly country.\u201d",
      "Merz described the commentary as \u201cintrusive and pretentious.\u201d",
      "Saskia Esken, co-leader of Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD), vowed fierce resistance to attempts by state actors as well as the rich and influential to influence Germany\u2019s elections.",
      "\u201cIn Elon\u00a0Musk\u2019s world, democracy and workers\u2019 rights are obstacles to more profit,\u201d Esken told Reuters. \u201cWe say quite clearly: Our democracy is defensible and it cannot be bought.\u201d",
      "Welt\u2019s editor-in-chief designate defended the decision to publish the commentary, saying that democracy and journalism thrive on freedom of opinion, including polarizing positions.",
      "The AfD is running second in\u00a0opinion polls\u00a0and might be able to thwart a center-right or center-left majority. Germany\u2019s mainstream, more centrist parties have pledged to shun any support from the AfD at the national level."

    "story": [
      "A Russian man arrested and accused of running a travel agency for gay customers was found dead in custody in Moscow, rights group OVD-Info reported Sunday, amid a crackdown on LGBTQ rights in Russia.",
      "According to OVD-Info, which tracks political arrests, Andrei Kotov \u2014 director of the \u201cMen Travel\u201d agency \u2014 faced charges of \u201corganizing extremist activity and participating in it.\u201d",
      "OVD-Info said an investigator told Kotov\u2019s lawyer that her client had died by suicide early Sunday while in pretrial detention and was found dead in his cell.",
      "Prior to Kotov\u2019s death, independent media outlet Mediazona reported earlier this month that Kotov had rejected the charges and said in court that law enforcement officers beat him and administered electric shocks during the arrest, even though he didn\u2019t resist.",
      "Just over a year ago, Russia\u2019s Supreme Court effectively outlawed any LGBTQ activism in a ruling that designated \u201cthe international LGBT movement\u201d as extremist. The move exposed anyone in the community or connected to it to criminal prosecution and prison, ushering in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.",
      "The LGBTQ community in Russia has been under legal and public pressure for over a decade but especially since the Kremlin sent troops to Ukraine in 2022. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has argued that the war is a proxy battle with the West, which he says aims to destroy Russia and its \u201ctraditional family values\u201d by pushing for LGBTQ rights."

    "summary": "Azerbaijan\u2019s President Ilham Aliyev said Sunday that the Azerbaijani airliner that crashed last week was shot down by Russia, albeit unintentionally, and criticized Moscow for trying to \u201chush up\u201d the issue for days.",
    "story": [
      "Azerbaijan\u2019s President Ilham Aliyev said Sunday that\u00a0the Azerbaijani airliner\u00a0that crashed last week was shot down by Russia, albeit unintentionally, and\u00a0criticized Moscow\u00a0for trying to \u201chush up\u201d the issue for days.",
      "\u201cWe can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. (...) We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,\u201d he told Azerbaijani state television.",
      "Aliyev said that the airliner, which\u00a0crashed Wednesday in Kazakhstan,\u00a0was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and \u201crendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.\u201d Aliyev accused Russia of trying to \u201chush up\u201d the issue for several days, saying he was \u201cupset and surprised\u201d by versions of events put forward by Russian officials.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, for the first three days we heard nothing from Russia except delirious versions,\u201d he said.",
      "The crash killed 38 of 67 people on board. The Kremlin said that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the plane attempted to land, to deflect a Ukrainian drone strike.",
      "Aliyev said Azerbaijan made three demands to Russia in connection with the crash.",
      "\u201cFirst, the Russian side must apologize to Azerbaijan. Second, it must admit its guilt. Third, punish the guilty, bring them to criminal responsibility and pay compensation to the Azerbaijani state, the injured passengers and crew members,\u201d he said.",
      "Aliyev noted that the first demand was \u201calready fulfilled\u201d when Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to him on Saturday. Putin called the crash a \u201ctragic incident\u201d though stopped short of acknowledging Moscow\u2019s responsibility.",
      "He said that an investigation into the crash was ongoing, and that \u201cthe final version (of events) will be known after the black boxes are opened.\u201d",
      "He noted that Azerbaijan was always \u201cin favor of a group of international experts\u201d investigating the crash, and had \u201ccategorically refused\u201d Russia\u2019s suggestion that the Interstate Aviation Committee, which oversees civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, investigate it.",
      "\u201cIt is no secret that this organization consists mostly of Russian officials and is headed by Russian citizens. The factors of objectivity could not be fully ensured here,\u201d Aliyev said.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media on Sunday that Putin had spoken to Aliyev over the phone again, but did not provide details of the conversation.",
      "The Kremlin also said a joint investigation by Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan was underway at the crash site near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane was flying from Azerbaijan\u2019s capital, Baku, to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometers (miles) across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination, and crashed while making an attempt to land.",
      "Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny.",
      "Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia\u2019s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic.",
      "The crash is the\u00a0second deadly civil aviation accident\u00a0linked to fighting in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard, as it flew over the area in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014.",
      "Russia has denied responsibility, but a\u00a0Dutch court in 2022\u00a0convicted two Russians and a pro-Russia Ukrainian man for their role in downing the plane with an air defense system brought into Ukraine from a Russian military base."

      "Outgoing President\u00a0Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-EU\u00a0opponent of\u00a0the ruling party, said in a defiant speech to supporters outside the presidential palace that she was leaving the residence, but that Kavelashvili had no legitimacy as president, which is a mostly ceremonial position.",
      "She said: \u201cI will come out of here and be with you\u201d.",
      "\u201cI am taking legitimacy with me, I am taking the flag with me, I am taking your trust with me,\u201d she added, before walking out of the palace to mingle with her supporters.",

      "The\u00a0Georgian Dream ruling party and the country\u2019s election commission say that the October election was free and fair. The ruling party says Kavelashvili is the duly elected president.",
      "The presidential standoff is seen as a watershed moment in\u00a0Georgia, a mountainous country of 3.7 million that had until recently been regarded as among the most democratic and pro-Western of the former Soviet states.",
      "Kavelashvili is a loyalist of\u00a0Bidzina Ivanishvili, a reclusive billionaire ex-prime minister who is widely seen as\u00a0Georgia\u2019s de facto leader.",
      "On Friday, the U.S.\u00a0imposed sanctions\u00a0on Ivanishvili, saying he was spearheading\u00a0Georgia\u2019s current anti-Western and pro-Russian turn.",

      "Georgian Dream got almost 54% of the official vote in October\u2019s election.",
      "Local and international election monitors have said the vote was marked by violations that could have affected the results. Western countries have called for an investigation.",
      "Zourabichvili is backed by the country\u2019s four main pro-EU opposition parties, which have boycotted parliament since the election. They say she will remain the legitimate president until fresh elections are held.",
      "The confrontation comes amid a month of\u00a0protests\u00a0sparked by\u00a0Georgian Dream\u2019s suspension of EU accession talks until 2028, abruptly halting a longstanding national goal of joining the bloc that is written into the country\u2019s constitution.",
      "The move touched off widespread anger among\u00a0Georgians, who polls show are firmly pro-EU, and prompted a police\u00a0crackdown, with over 400 people, including senior opposition leaders, detained.",
      "Zourabichvili has accused\u00a0Georgian Dream of deliberately sinking\u00a0Georgia\u2019s EU hopes and instead moving towards Russia, from which\u00a0Georgia\u00a0gained independence in 1991.",
      "Opposition supporters say that under Zourabichvili, who was elected with\u00a0Georgian Dream\u2019s support in 2018 before breaking with the party in recent years, the presidency was the only institution in the country not ultimately under the control of ruling party founder Ivanishvili.",
      "They say that with the installation of Kavelashvili, Ivanishvili will have total control over\u00a0Georgia."
