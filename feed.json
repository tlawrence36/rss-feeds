    "story": [
      "He won a following in the 1950s and \u201960s lampooning marriage, politics, racism.",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Tom Lehrer, the popular song satirist who lampooned marriage, politics, racism and the Cold War, then largely abandoned his music career to return to teaching math at Harvard and other universities, has died. He was 97.",
      "Longtime friend David Herder said Lehrer died Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He did not specify a cause of death.",
      "Lehrer had remained on the math faculty of the University of California at Santa Cruz well into his late 70s. In 2020, he even turned away from his own copyright, granting the public permission to use his lyrics in any format without any fee in return.",
      "A Harvard prodigy (he had earned a math degree from the institution at age 18), Lehrer soon turned his very sharp mind to old traditions and current events. His songs included \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" \"The Old Dope Peddler\" (set to a tune reminiscent of \"The Old Lamplighter\"), \"Be Prepared\" (in which he mocked the Boy Scouts) and \"The Vatican Rag,\" in which Lehrer, an atheist, poked at the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church. (Sample lyrics: \u201cGet down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries. Bow your head with great respect, and genuflect, genuflect, genuflect.\u201d)",
      "Accompanying himself on piano, he performed the songs in a colorful style reminiscent of such musical heroes as Gilbert and Sullivan and Stephen Sondheim, the latter a lifelong friend. Lehrer was often likened to such contemporaries as Allen Sherman and Stan Freberg for his comic riffs on culture and politics and he was cited by Randy Newman and \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic among others as an influence.",
      "He mocked the forms of music he didn't like (modern folk songs, rock 'n' roll and modern jazz), laughed at the threat of nuclear annihilation and denounced discrimination.",
      "But he attacked in such an erudite, even polite, manner that almost no one objected.",
      "\"Tom Lehrer is the most brilliant song satirist ever recorded,\" musicologist Barry Hansen once said. Hansen co-produced the 2000 boxed set of Lehrer's songs, \"The Remains of Tom Lehrer,\" and had featured Lehrer's music for decades on his syndicated \"Dr. Demento\" radio show.",
      "Lehrer's body of work was actually quite small, amounting to about three dozen songs.",
      "\"When I got a funny idea for a song, I wrote it. And if I didn't, I didn't,\" Lehrer told The Associated Press in 2000 during a rare interview. \"I wasn't like a real writer who would sit down and put a piece of paper in the typewriter. And when I quit writing, I just quit. ... It wasn't like I had writer's block.\"",
      "He'd gotten into performing accidentally when he began to compose songs in the early 1950s to amuse his friends. Soon he was performing them at coffeehouses around Cambridge, while he remained at Harvard to teach and obtain a master's degree in math.",
      "He cut his first record in 1953, \"Songs by Tom Lehrer,\" which included \"I Wanna Go Back to Dixie,\" lampooning the attitudes of the Old South, and the \"Fight Fiercely, Harvard,\" suggesting how a prissy Harvard blueblood might sing a football fight song.",
      "After a two-year stint in the Army, Lehrer began to perform concerts of his material in venues around the world. In 1959, he released another LP called \"More of Tom Lehrer\" and a live recording called \"An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer,\" nominated for a Grammy for best comedy performance (musical) in 1960.",
      "But around the same time, he largely quit touring and returned to teaching math, though he did some writing and performing on the side.",
      "Lehrer said he was never comfortable appearing in public.",
      "\"I enjoyed it up to a point,\" he told The AP in 2000. \"But to me, going out and performing the concert every night when it was all available on record would be like a novelist going out and reading his novel every night.\"",

      "He released the songs the following year in an album titled \"That Was the Year That Was.\u201d The material included \"Who's Next?\" that ponders which government will be the next to get the nuclear bomb ... perhaps Alabama? (He didn't need to tell his listeners that it was a bastion of segregation at the time.) \"Pollution\" takes a look at the then-new concept that perhaps rivers and lakes should be cleaned up.",
      "He also wrote songs for the 1970s educational children's show \"The Electric Company.\" He told AP in 2000 that hearing from people who had benefited from them gave him far more satisfaction than praise for any of his satirical works.",
      "His songs were revived in the 1980 musical revue \"Tomfoolery\" and he made a rare public appearance in London in 1998 at a celebration honoring that musical's producer, Cameron Mackintosh.",
      "Lehrer was born in 1928, in New York City, the son of a successful necktie designer. He recalled an idyllic childhood on Manhattan's Upper West Side that included attending Broadway shows with his family and walking through Central Park day or night.",
      "After skipping two grades in school, he entered Harvard at 15 and, after receiving his master's degree, he spent several years unsuccessfully pursuing a doctorate.",
      "\"I spent many, many years satisfying all the requirements, as many years as possible, and I started on the thesis,\" he once said. \"But I just wanted to be a grad student, it's a wonderful life. That's what I wanted to be, and unfortunately, you can't be a Ph.D. and a grad student at the same time.\"",
      "He began to teach part-time at Santa Cruz in the 1970s, mainly to escape the harsh New England winters.",
      "From time to time, he acknowledged, a student would enroll in one of his classes based on knowledge of his songs.",
      "\"But it's a real math class,\" he said at the time. \"I don't do any funny theorems. So those people go away pretty quickly.\"",

      "Rahbani, also known as a political provocateur, died Saturday at age 69. The cause of death was not immediately known.",
      "His passing shocked much of the Arab world, which appreciated his satire, unapologetic political critique and avante-garde, jazz-inspired compositions that mirrored the chaos and contradictions of Lebanon throughout its civil war from 1975 until 1990.

      "Andre wrapped his tree-trunk arms around the champ and tried to wring the final breaths out of Hogan with a bear hug so tight that more than 90,000 fans in Detroit almost witnessed the final day of Hulkamania.",
      "But, wait!",
      "This was Hulk Hogan.",
      "Wrestling\u2019s biggest star had more late comebacks than fellow 1980s sports stars John Elway or Michael Jordan combined. Hogan had some gas left in the tank, some extra bite in those 24-inch pythons, and hammered away at Andre. One right hand, then another one, and another! Wrestling fans roared as they knew the bad news that was coming for Andre. Hogan fought back \u2014 much as he did against those 1980s baddies out of the Cold War or Iran \u2014 and finally body-slammed Andre the Giant. Hogan hit the hopes and delivered his famous leg drop on Andre\u2019s chest to get the three count.",
      "Hulk Hogan won again at WrestleMania.",

      "Hogan had the hulking size, the charisma and catchphrases \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019cha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?\u201d \u2014 that led the industry out of gyms and regional arenas and into NFL stadiums, like that 1987 night when Hogan beat Andre at the Pontiac Silverdome in WrestleMania III.",

      "Whether you break out an eye roll or crank up Hogan\u2019s \u201c Real American \u201d anthem to that statement depends, of course, on one\u2019s ability to suspend disbelief. There is no denying, though, just how real Hogan\u2019s impact was on professional wrestling and pop culture in the 1980s. He stood toe-to-toe with Rocky Balboa. He fought side-by-side with Mr. T. He hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and flexed on the cover of Sports Illustrated.",
      "\u201cHe did what he set out to do,\u201d WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter said Friday by phone. \u201cHe became the most recognized, not only professional wrestler and sports entertainer in the world, he\u2019s probably top-five of anybody you\u2019d recognize when you saw him.\u201d",
      "WWE has long claimed the paid attendance of WrestleMania III was 93,173, a number some historians claim is as artificially inflated as the chemically-enhanced biceps of that era. What can\u2019t be disputed, when the two had their match in 1988, live on national television, more than 33 million fans tuned in to NBC, still far and away the record for largest viewing audience in American televised wrestling.",
      "Making money and moving merch. That was the real power of Hulkamania.",
      "Hogan, who died Thursday in Florida at age 71, left behind more than three decades of memorable matches that captured the spirit of those little Hulkamaniacs to the ones that loved to hate him in the 1990s as \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan in the New World Order.",
      "Here are some of his best moments.",
      "Hogan wasn\u2019t some upstart when he returned to the WWF (now WWE) in late 1983. He tested the waters of Hulkamania in the old American Wrestling Association and made his famous appearance as Thunderlips in \u201cRocky III,\u201d when was beckoned back to WWE and became an instant contender to face the champion, the hated Iron Sheik. Hogan broke out of the dreaded camel clutch and pinned the Sheik to become the new champion on Jan. 23, 1984, at Madison Square Garden \u2014 the building paid tribute to Hogan on Thursday night \u2014 and set the course for Hulkamania.",

If the company said Andre the Giant had never been slammed, and had never been pinned over a 15-year undefeated streak, then it was believed to be true (neither were, of course).",
      "Yet, the faux hype set the stage for the match that changed wrestling forever.",
      "\u201cAndre the Giant was a momentum-shifting moment where he passed his torch,\u201d Hogan said in a 2009 interview with the AP. \u201cHe was like the icing on the cake. Once he blessed me, it was up to me to mold that business and carry it through.\u201d",
      "By 1996, Hogan\u2019s good-guy, beats-the-odds character had grown stale as he made the shift from WWE to Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling. Hogan even started to get booed as wrestling fans clamored for a new direction, a new star on top.",
      "They got one. \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan.",
      "For weeks, two former WWE stars had \u201cinvaded\u201d WCW and claimed they were taking over the company. That led to a six-man tag-team match where the two outsiders, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, promised a third man to help with their cause. No one showed to help the two until the end, when Hogan walked out in his red-and-yellow attire, and stunned the crowd when he put the leg drop on Randy Savage. Hogan was third man. He ditched his traditional colors for black-and-white, sunglasses, dark facial hair and embraced the \u201cHollywood\u201d heel persona.",
      "Much as he did a decade earlier, Hogan led WCW to new heights and the company would defeat WWE in the TV ratings for 83 straight weeks in what would be known as the \u201cMonday Night Wars.\u201d Hogan lost as much as he won without his Hulkamania powers. He still moved the needle where it mattered most and made WCW must-see TV every Monday night.",
      "With WCW out of business and bought by McMahon, Hogan kept a low profile until he made a comeback with WWE in 2002. He returned with Hall and Nash as the NWO but at this point, WWE fans wanted their old Hulkster back.",
      "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was WWE\u2019s baby-faced crowd favorite when he met the villainous Hogan at WrestleMania in an \u201cIcon vs. Icon\u201d match in WrestleMania in 2002. One problem, the Toronto crowd decided to back Hogan.",
      "\u201cWhen we hit the ring, 70,000 loyal people didn\u2019t want to hate Hulk Hogan,\u201d Hogan said in 2009. \u201cEverybody kind of started to panic and I just said, \u2019Brother, stick with me and I\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d\u2019",
      "After the match, the cheers for Hogan called for a last-second change of plans, with his former NWO allies running down to attack him. The Rock helped Hogan fight off the NWO and the two men posed together to riotous cheers.",
      "\u201cAs I raised his hand and said he\u2019s the greatest wrestler in the world, they had to turn me back red and yellow immediately,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting, that was going to be the nail in my coffin. It turned out to be the fountain of youth for me.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain's greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died. She was 97.",
      "The Stables, a charity and venue Laine founded with her late jazz musician husband John Dankworth, said Friday it was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the news that \u201cone of its founders and Life President, Dame Cleo Laine has passed away.\"",
      "Monica Ferguson, artistic director of The Stables, said Laine \"will be greatly missed, but her unique talent will always be remembered.\u201d",
      "Laine's career spanned the Atlantic and crossed genres: She sang the songs of Kurt Weill, Arnold Schoenberg and Robert Schumann; she acted on stage and on film, and even played God in a production of Benjamin Britten's \"Noye's Fludde.\"",
      "Laine's life and art were intimately bound up with band leader Dankworth, who gave her a job and her stage name in 1951, and married her seven years later. Both were still performing after their 80th birthdays. Dankworth died in 2010 at 82.",
      "In 1997, Laine became the first British jazz artist to be made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight.",
      "\"It is British jazz that should have received the accolade for its service to me,\" she said when the honor was announced. \"It has given me a wonderful life, a successful career and an opportunity to travel the globe doing what I love to do.\"",
      "Laine was born Clementina Dinah Campbell in 1927. Her father, Alexander Campbell, was a Jamaican who loved opera and earned money during the Depression as a street singer. Despite hard times, her British mother, Minnie, made sure that her daughter had piano, voice and dance lessons.",
      "She began performing at local events at age 3, and at age 12 she got a role as a movie extra in \"The Thief of Bagdad.\" Leaving school at 14, Laine went to work as a hairdresser and faced repeated rejection in her efforts to get a job as a singer.",
      "A decade later, in 1951, she tried out for the Johnny Dankworth Seven, and succeeded. \"Clementina Campbell\" was judged too long for a marquee, so she became Cleo Laine.",
      "\"John said that when he heard me, I didn't sound like anyone else who was singing at the time,\" Laine once said. \"I guess the reason I didn't get the other jobs is that they were looking for a singer who did sound like somebody else.\"",
      "Laine had a remarkable range, from tenor to contralto, and a sound often described as \"smoky.\"",
      "Dankworth, in an interview with the Irish Independent, recalled Laine's audition.",
      "\"They were all sitting there with stony faces, so I asked the Scottish trumpet player Jimmy Deuchar, who was looking very glum and was the hardest nut of all, whether he thought she had something. 'Something?' he said, 'She's got everything!'\"",
      "Offered 6 pounds a week, Laine demanded \u2014 and got \u2014 7 pounds.",
      "\"They used to call me 'Scruff', although I don't think I was scruffy. It was just that having come from the sticks, I didn't know how to put things together as well as the other singers of the day,\" she told the Irish Independent. \"And anyway, I didn't have the money, because they weren't paying me enough.\"",
      "Recognition came swiftly. Laine was runner-up in Melody Maker's \"girl singer\" category in 1952, and topped the list in 1956 and 1957.",
      "She married Dankworth \u2014 and quit his band \u2014 in 1958, a year after her divorce from her first husband, George Langridge. As Dankworth's band prospered, Laine began to feel underused.",

      "Her stage career began in 1958 when she was invited to join the cast of a West Indian play, \"Flesh to a Tiger,\" at the Royal Court Theatre, and was surprised to find herself in the lead role. She won a Moscow Arts Theatre Award for her performance.",

      "The following year, she and Dankworth drew a sold-out audience at Carnegie Hall, launching a series of popular appearances. \"Cleo at Carnegie\" won a Grammy award in 1986, the same year she was a Tony nominee for \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\"",
      "A reviewer for Variety in 2002 found her voice going strong: \"a dark, creamy voice, remarkable range and control from bottomless contralto to a sweet clear soprano. Her perfect pitch and phrasing is always framed with musical imagination and good taste.\"",
      "Perhaps Laine's most difficult performance of all was on Feb. 6, 2010, at a concert celebrating the 40th anniversary of the concert venue she and Dankworth had founded at their home, during which Laine and both of her children performed.",
      "\"I'm terribly sorry that Sir John can't be here today,\" Laine told the crowd at the end of the show. \u201cBut earlier on my husband died in hospital.\u201d",
      "Laine said in an interview with the Boston Globe in 2003 that the secret of her longevity was that \"I was never a complete belter.\"",
      "\"There was always a protective side in me, and an inner voice always said, 'Don't do that \u2014 it's not good for you and your voice.'\"",

      "\u201cI did not think it was an appropriate place for an 11-year-old on a stadium stage,\u201d she said in the documentary. \u201cI made a deal with her, and I said, \u2018If you practice and you show your commitment, I\u2019ll let you do one show.\u2019\u201d Blue Ivy fulfilled her end of the deal, and a fan base was formed: the \u201cIvy League.\u201d",

      "George Kooymans, guitarist and co-founder of the Dutch band Golden Earring, has died at 77",
      "NEW YORK -- George Kooymans, the guitarist and co-founder of the Dutch band Golden Earring who co-wrote the hard-rock classic \u201cRadar Love\u201d and wrote and shared lead vocals on the top 10 hit \u201cTwilight Zone,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Kooymans' family and the surviving members of Golden Earring announced that he had died Wednesday from complications of ALS, which he had been diagnosed with in 2020. He retired from the band soon after.",
      "\u201cGeorge bore this devastating and debilitating illness with exceptional strength and dignity,\u201d the statement from Golden Earring reads in part. \u201cWe bid farewell to a great musician and composer, whose work extended beyond Golden Earring. George was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, but above all, a friend.\u201d",
      "A native of The Hague, Kooymans was in his mid-teens when he helped found what became Golden Earring in the early 1960s: The band's name was inspired by an instrumental of the time, \u201cGolden Earrings.\u201d He was also a core member of the group's best known lineup, which featured drummer Cesar Zuiderwijk, singer-guitarist Barry Hay and bassist-keyboardist Rinus Gerritsen and stayed together from 1970 until Koosyman's departure.",
      "With more than 20 top 10 singles in their native country, Golden Earring had more success at home than overseas. But they began to attract an underground following in the U.S. in the late 1960s and broke through commercially in 1973 with the worldwide hit \u201cRadar Love,\" which has been covered by U2, R.E.M. and hundreds of others and used on the soundtrack to \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d \u201cWayne's World 2\u201d and other films.",
      "\u201cRadar Love,\u201d with its stately opening riff and memorable opening line \u201cI\u2019ve been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheel,\u201d was once ranked by Rolling Stone as among the greatest road trip songs.",

      "The show features Payne as a guest judge, offering pointed but witty advice to young bands chasing success not unlike what he achieved as part of the culture-shifting boy band, One Direction. Payne died in October after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina, not long after the show\u2019s production wrapped.",

      "The show is hosted by McLean, with Pussycat Dolls frontwoman \u2014 and newly minted Tony winner \u2014 Nicole Scherzinger mentoring the bands and Destiny\u2019s Child star Kelly Rowland serving as a guest judge alongside Payne.",

      "Payne first appears in the seventh episode for the showcase, where each band performs in front of a live audience and the judges, only about a week after they form.",
      "\u201cWe were amazing dancers, obviously, in One Direction,\u201d Payne joked in the episode while offering critiques to boy band Midnight \u2019til Morning, whose members expressed hesitations with dancing onstage. Band member Mason Watts then revealed his family had won tickets to sit front row at a One Direction concert when he was 11, stoking applause from the crowd and a heartfelt response from Payne.",
      "\u201cEver since that moment, I wanted to be in a group,\u201d Watts, originally from Australia, said in the episode. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a full-circle moment to be here with a group and performing in front of you. So, thank you, man.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast's new CEO hit Wall Street Wednesday as YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson's media empire looks to develop long-term brand partnerships and, in turn, unlock more funding for its charitable content.",
      "Venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold took over MrBeast leadership last summer with a mandate to professionalize an ever-growing entertainment company. YouTube's most popular creator had reached record audience levels far outpacing its startup days, while vowing to reassess its internal culture amid multiple controversies. But, despite joining Nasdaq's closing bell ceremony on Wednesday, Housenbold said their strategic plan does not currently include a public offering \u2014 or any active funding rounds.",
      "\u201cDo I want to make banger content? Yeah. That\u2019s cool,\" Housenbold told The Associated Press. \"But what can we do with that banger content? Generate profits, make a sustainable business that gives us greater ability to impact people\u2019s lives around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching quickly to profitability, so we don\u2019t have to raise additional capital,\u201d he added.",
      "Instead, MrBeast is focused on securing multi-year exclusive advertising deals as opposed to single-video brand partnerships. With 416 million subscribers and legions of impressionable young fans, Housenbold argued that MrBeast is uniquely positioned to deliver more bang for companies' marketing bucks by pointing that \u201cfirehouse of attention\u201d at them.",
      "Along the way, Housenbold said he is encouraging Donaldson to tout the channel's charitable works \u2014 which often feature quantifiable stunts such as building wells, removing ocean plastic or covering cataract surgery costs. The company, in his view, \u201ccan do good while doing well.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more people who like us \u2019cause we do good, the more people watch our videos,\" he said. \u201cThe more people watch our videos, the more we\u2019re able to drive in fees from our advertising partners... the more we can invest in more content to do more good in the world.\u201d",
      "New projects such as the Amazon Prime reality show and a James Patterson novel from HarperCollins aim to diversify the genders and ages of his audience. Housenbold said that base has historically consisted mostly of 8-to-25-year-olds and men.",
      "But Housenbold acknowledged missteps in last year's production of \u201cBeast Games,\" which prompted allegations of \u201cunsafe\u201d conditions from some contestants who said an unorganized set led to injuries, irregular food provision and lacking access to medication. While describing most of those reports as \u201cinaccurate,\u201d Housenbold said they were \u201cbetter prepared\u201d for the second season's recently wrapped shoot.",

      "NEW YORK -- They're not going their own way anymore. After much speculation, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham announced Wednesday the reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d more than 50 years after the release of their only full-length album as a duo.",
      "Since its initial release in 1973, \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d has never been reissued and is not currently available on streaming platforms. The remastered version arrives Sept. 19 via Rhino Records' high-fidelity series and was sourced from the original analog master tapes. The album will also receive a CD and digital release for the first time, and the opening track, \u201cCrying in the Night,\u201d was available to stream Wednesday.",
      "Buckingham and Nicks were in their early to mid-20s during the making of their album. \u201cIt was a very natural thing, from the beginning,\u201d Nicks says in the re-release's liner notes, written by music journalist David Fricke.",
      "Despite their relative inexperience, \u201cit stands up in a way you would hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work,\u201d Buckingham says, according to the announcement release.",
      "The reissue announcement was foreshadowed by cryptic Instagram posts last week. Both Nicks and Buckingham shared handwritten lyrics to their official social media accounts.",
      "\u201cAnd if you go forward\u2026\u201d Nicks posted, a line from their song \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d which appears on \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",

      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

      "The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV",
      "LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission.",
      "In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cconsidered to be of major public health interest.\u201d Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.",

      "Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the U.N. AIDS agency, has said the drug \u201ccould change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic\u201d if it is made available to everyone who needs it.",
      "In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized lenacapavir to prevent HIV. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization recommended countries offer the drug as an additional option to people at risk of the virus.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly. Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months. Lenacapavir\u2019s six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more visits to health clinics or stigma from taking daily pills.",
      "Critics have raised concerns, however, that lenacapavir may not be made widely enough available to stop global outbreaks of HIV. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.",

      "Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot",
      "After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d years before the federal government acted.",
      "But the state has a blind spot when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in its mobile home parks.",
      "Regulators say they have little power to enforce the rules in the state's estimated 100 or more unlicensed parks when owners fail to provide safe water. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan \u2014 among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases.",
      "Officials say it can be a struggle to even contact those park owners, let alone get them to comply with regulations.",
      "\u201cWith private equity moving into this space, the goal these companies seem to have is to return the absolute highest return they can to investors even if that means providing inadequate service or engaging in exploitative practices, or unsafe practices for the residents,\u201d said state Sen. John Cherry, a Democrat who sponsored legislation to strengthen enforcement in the communities.",
      "But the state doesn't attempt to track unlicensed parks. And an industry spokesperson said Michigan officials \u2014 particularly law enforcement \u2014 have the power to do more if they choose.",
      "At North Morris Estates where Theo Gantos lives outside Flint, conditions got so bad that the state refused to renew the park\u2019s license to operate.",
      "Water often flowed weakly from the tap because the wells that service the park didn\u2019t produce enough, Gantos said. Sometimes the water was discolored. It could stain laundry and destroy appliances. He installed a multistage filter system just to be able to use it.",
      "Eventually, local law enforcement investigated. In March, the owner pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for operating without a license, agreeing to pay a fine and sell the park.",
      "That might not have happened if Gantos had not been so pugnacious. He spent years battling Homes of America, an affiliate of private equity group Alden Global Capital that local prosecutors said owns North Morris. That included filing a public records request for emails on officials\u2019 handling of problems at his park, pushing regulators to enforce rules and speaking out to media over what he calls blight conditions.",
      "\u201cThese guys, they don\u2019t care,\u201d Gantos said about complying with the rules.",
      "Representatives of North Morris and Homes of America, including an attorney who appeared for the park in legal proceedings, did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, called LARA, has the authority to inspect and investigate complaints at licensed mobile home parks. But it\u2019s typically fallen to law enforcement to pursue criminal charges against unlicensed parks.",
      "The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state\u2019s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said.",

      "\u201cThis whole notion that, \u2018There\u2019s nothing we can do about this.\u2019 Clearly there is, or that prosecution wouldn\u2019t have taken place,\u201d Lindley said. \u201cNot having the authority to go after communities that don\u2019t have a license is completely different from choosing not to go after those. And what we\u2019ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they\u2019ve elected not to.\u201d",
      "Mobile home parks without a license are \u201cessentially operating unregulated,\u201d Cherry said. One of the state\u2019s few options is to shut down a park, a rarely used last resort that can mean throwing people out of their homes.",
      "Mobile home parks have long been an important affordable housing option. But that affordability is fading.",
      "A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 \u2014 new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period.",
      "Last year, LARA supported legislation that would have given the department more power to penalize unlicensed parks, force parks to provide owner contact information and limit rent increases. That failed.",
      "This year, Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin has proposed a narrower law that would give state drinking water officials more power to make sure water in all mobile home parks is drinkable. Right now, they only have direct authority over parks that provide their own water. But it\u2019s common for parks to take city water from a pipe connecting to the nearby town.",
      "That water is usually safe when it reaches the park, but if the park\u2019s water pipes crack or fail, water protections won\u2019t apply on the private property. That keeps officials from stepping in and forcing change except in limited situations when there\u2019s a public health threat. It can leave residents unsure where to turn when the owner refuses to fix problems.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday.",
      "While the organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized.",
      "\u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee and whose mother died waiting for a liver transplant.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,\u201d Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor.",
      "The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. That surgery never happened after a doctor noticed him moving and moaning while being transported to the operating room \u2014 and the man survived.",
      "Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately and save tens of thousands of lives a year. But the federal probe \u2013 concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing -- cited a \u201cconcerning pattern of risk\u201d in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs.",
      "The report said some should have been stopped or reassessed earlier, and mostly involved small or rural hospitals with less experience in caring for potential organ donors.",
      "The Kentucky organ procurement organization, or OPO, has made changes and the national transplant network is working on additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday was any testimony from hospitals \u2013 whose doctors must independently determine a patient is dead before donation groups are allowed to retrieve organs.",
      "Here's a look at how the nation's transplant system works.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list and about 13 a day die waiting, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.",
      "Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to even be considered for organ donation. Most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue instead.",
      "Several groups are involved in every transplant: the hospital caring for someone dead or dying; the 55 OPOs that coordinate recovery of organs and help match them to patients on the waiting list; and transplant centers that decide if an organ is the right fit for their patients.",
      "Adding to the complexity, two government agencies \u2014 HRSA, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 share regulatory oversight of different parts of the donation and transplant process.",
      "Most organ donors are brain-dead \u2013 when testing determines someone has no brain function after a catastrophic injury. The body is left on a ventilator to support the organs until they can be retrieved.",

      "But increasingly organs are donated after circulatory death, called DCD \u2013 when people die because their heart stops. It usually happens when doctors determine someone has a nonsurvivable injury and the family withdraws life support.",
      "Hospitals are required to alert their area OPO to every potential donor who is declared brain-dead or once the decision to withdraw life support is made. The OPOs by law can't participate in that decision and \"we are not even in the room at that time,\u201d said Barry Massa of Kentucky's Network for Hope.",
      "During the following days of preparation, hospital employees continue caring for the patient \u2013 while the donation team talks with the family about the process, gathers hospital records showing the patient is eligible, requests tests of organ quality, and make arrangements with transplant centers to use them.",
      "Once the hospital withdraws life support and the heart stops beating there\u2019s a mandatory wait \u2013 five minutes \u2013 to be sure it won\u2019t restart. When the doctor declares death, the organ retrieval process can begin.",
      "Organs are only considered usable if death occurs relatively quickly, usually up to about two hours. Sometimes that takes much longer and thus the organs can\u2019t be used \u2013 and HRSA\u2019s Dr. Raymond Lynch told Congress that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything was done wrong. Still, he said HRSA is investigating reports of possible mistakes elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis is a technically demanding form of care\u201d that requires \u201cgood collaboration between the OPO and the hospital,\u201d he said.",
      "At issue is how doctors are sure when it\u2019s time to withdraw life support from a dying patient \u2014 and the delicate balance of how OPOs interact with hospital staff in preparing for donation once death occurs.",
      "In May, HRSA quietly ordered the U.S. transplant network to oversee improvements at the Kentucky OPO and to develop new national policies making clear that anyone \u2013 family, hospital staff or organ donation staff \u2013 can call for a pause in donation preparations any time there are concerns about the patient\u2019s eligibility.",
      "Lynch said the government now wants more proactive collaboration from OPOs to give hospital staff \u201ca clear understanding\u201d of when to at least temporarily halt and reevaluate a potential donor if their health status changes.",
      "Kentucky's Massa said his group only received HRSA\u2019s reports this week \u2013 but that after learning about last fall\u2019s allegations, it made some changes. Massa said every hospital doctor and nurse now gets a checklist on caring for potential donors and how to pause when concerns are raised \u2014 and anyone can anonymously report complaints.",

      "Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to",
      "The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah\u2019s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination.",
      "The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic as much as 10 times the federal limit. Smith had to put the rural park under a do-not-drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe Health Department refers it to us like ... \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys regulating it?\u2019 We had no idea it existed,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans\u2019 water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can\u2019t always count on those basic protections.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And the problems are likely even bigger because the EPA database doesn\u2019t catch all parks.",
      "Even where parks get water from an outside source \u2014 such as a city \u2014 the clean water coming in can become contaminated if it passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because the EPA doesn\u2019t generally require this water to be tested and regulated, the problems may go unseen.",
      "Utah is one of the few states to step in with their own rules, according to an AP survey of state policies.",
      "\u201cIf you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the \u201970s when they were starting, it was, \u2018Well, as long as the source \u2026 is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "In one Colorado mobile home park, raw sewage backed up into a bathtub. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee \u2014 scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. In California, boxes of bottled water crowd a family's kitchen over fears of arsenic.",
      "Almost 17 million people in the U.S. live in mobile homes. Some are comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes and see mobile homes as a rare opportunity for home ownership.",
      "To understand how water in the parks can be so troubled, it\u2019s useful to remember that residents often own their homes but rent the land they sit on. Despite the name, it's difficult and expensive to move a mobile home. That means they\u2019re \u201chalfway homeowners,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Residents often put up with \u201creally egregious\u201d property maintenance by landlords because all their money is tied up in their home, she said.",
      "Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. By then, she had spent eight years in a park where sewage backed up into homes and the flow of tap water was sometimes weak or discolored.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn\u2019t get in my mouth because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI went to brush my teeth, and I just turned the faucet on and I brushed my teeth from the water coming from the faucet. I haven\u2019t been able to do that for over a year.\u201d",
      "Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The park's owner says a licensed professional ensures water is maintained and tested, and outages are minimized.",
      "The U.S. has some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns and rural areas. Many struggle to find expert staff and funding, and they violate clean water rules more often than the handful of large utilities that serve cities. But even among the hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand out.",
      "The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. And they are far more likely to be repeat offenders of safe drinking water rules overall.",
      "But that's only part of the story. The true rates of mobile home park violations aren\u2019t knowable because the EPA doesn\u2019t track them well. The agency\u2019s tap water violation database depends on information from states that often don\u2019t properly categorize mobile home parks.",
      "When Smith first searched Utah\u2019s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. With some keyword searches, he identified 33 more.",

      "One July day in 2021, officials with the EPA were out investigating sky-high arsenic levels in the tap water at Oasis Mobile Home Park in the Southern California desert when they realized the problem went way beyond just one place.",
      "\u201cIt was literally us driving around and going, \u2018Wait a minute, there\u2019s a bunch of mobile home parks!\u2019\u201d said Amy Miller, who previously served as EPA\u2019s head of enforcement for the Pacific Southwest region.",
      "The water in these other parks had been off their radar. At some, testing found high levels of cancer-causing arsenic in the water that had been provided to residents for years.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many unnoticed parks are out there. Most states aren\u2019t actively looking for them and say they find very few. In Colorado, after the state passed a new law to require water testing at all mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source of water unknown. That\u2019s about a tenth of the total parks in the state.",
      "Many parks are decades old with aging pipes that can cause chronic water problems, even if the water that supplies the park is clean when it enters the system.",
      "Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to find the piping in the mobile home parks because if there\u2019s any kind of obstruction, they just go around it,\u201d he said. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti laying in the ground.\u201d",
      "After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that \u201cwere barely buried. Some of them weren\u2019t buried.\u201d",
      "When pipes break and leak, the pressure drops and contaminants can enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water \u2014 where pipes dead-end or water sits unused \u2014 that increases the risk of bacterial growth.",
      "Rebecca Sadosky is public water supply chief in North Carolina, where mobile home communities make up close to 40% of all water systems. She said owners don\u2019t always realize when they buy a park that they could also be running a mini utility.",
      "\u201cI think they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re getting into the water business,\u201d she said.",
      "Utah is a rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that get their water from another provider, according to AP\u2019s survey of states. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner.",
      "In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get clear answers.\u201d",
      "Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. And if those parks are regulated, what\u2019s to stop the rules from extending to the privately owned pipes in big apartment buildings \u2014 the line has to be drawn somewhere, he said.",
      "Via said residents of parks where an owner refuses to fix water problems have options, including going to their local health departments, suing or complaining publicly.",
      "Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado\u2019s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. It gives health officials the ability to go beyond federal law to address taste, color and smell that can make people afraid to drink their water, even when it\u2019s not a health risk. The state is now a leader in protecting mobile home park tap water.",
      "Smith, the Utah environmental scientist, said stopping the contaminated water flowing into the mobile home park and connecting it to a safe supply felt like a career highlight.",
      "He said Utah's culture of making do with scarce water contributed to a willingness for stronger testing and regulations than the federal government requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of the communal nature of like, everybody should have access to clean water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.\u201d",

      "New federal data shows the fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024 with less than 1.6 kids per woman",
      "NEW YORK -- The fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024 with less than 1.6 kids per woman, new federal data released Thursday shows.",
      "The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it has been sliding in America for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.",
      "The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.",
      "Alarmed by recent drops, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d that might encourage more couples to have kids.",
      "But there's no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this as part of an ongoing process of fertility delay. We know that the U.S. population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase \u2014 more births than deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the statistic for the total fertility rate with updated birth data for 2024.",
      "In the early 1960s, the U.S. total fertility rate was around 3.5, but plummeted to 1.7 by 1976 after the Baby Boom ended. It gradually rose to 2.1 in 2007 before falling again, aside from a 2014 uptick. The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Birth rates are generally declining for women in most age groups \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t seem likely to change in the near future, said Karen Guzzo, director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina.",
      "People are marrying later and also worried about their ability to have the money, health insurance and other resources needed to raise children in a stable environment.",

      "The CDC's new report, which is based on a more complete review of birth certificates than provisional data released earlier this year, also showed a 1% increase in births \u2014 about 33,000 more \u2014 last year compared to the prior year.",
      "That brought the yearly national total to just over 3.6 million babies born.",
      "But this is different: The provisional data indicated birth rate increases last year for women in their late 20s and 30s. However, the new report found birth rate declines for women in their 20s and early 30s, and no change for women in their late 30s.",
      "What happened? CDC officials said it was due to recalculations stemming from a change in the U.S. Census population estimates used to compute the birth rate.",
      "That's plausible, Root said. As the total population of women of childbearing age grew due to immigration, it offset small increases in births to women in those age groups, she said.",

      "The United States and the European Union have agreed to a trade framework setting a 15% tariff on most goods",
      "EDINBURGH, Scotland -- The United States and the European Union agreed on Sunday to a trade framework setting a 15% tariff on most goods, staving off \u2014 at least for now \u2014 far higher import duties on both sides that might have sent shock waves through economies around the globe.",
      "The sweeping announcement came after President Donald Trump and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen met briefly at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland. Their private sit-down culminated months of bargaining, with the White House deadline Friday nearing for imposing punishing tariffs on the EU's 27 member countries.",
      "\u201cIt was a very interesting negotiation. I think it\u2019s going to be great for both parties,\u201d Trump said. The agreement, he said, was \u201ca good deal for everybody\u201d and \u201ca giant deal with lots of countries.\u201d",
      "Von der Leyen said the deal \u201cwill bring stability, it will bring predictability, that\u2019s very important for our businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d",
      "As with other, recent tariff agreements that Trump announced with countries including Japan and the United Kingdom, some major details remain pending in this one.",
      "Trump said the EU had agreed to buy some $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest $600 billion more than it already is in America \u2014 as well as make a major military equipment purchase. He said tariffs \u201cfor automobiles and everything else will be a straight across tariff of 15%\u201d and meant that U.S. exporters \u201dhave the opening up of all of the European countries.\u201d",
      "Von der Leyen said the 15% tariffs were \u201cacross the board, all inclusive\u201d and that \u201cindeed, basically the European market is open.\u201d",
      "At a later news conference away from Turnberry, she said the $750 billion in additional U.S. energy purchases was actually over the next three years \u2014 and would help ease the dependence on natural gas from Russia among the bloc\u2019s countries.",
      "\u201cWhen the European Union and the United States work together as partners, the benefits are tangible,\u201d Von der Leyen said, noting that the agreement \u201cstabilized on a single, 15% tariff rate for the vast majority of EU exports\" including cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.",
      "\u201c15% is a clear ceiling,\u201d she said.",
      "But von der Leyen also clarified that such a rate wouldn\u2019t apply to everything, saying that both sides agreed on \u201czero for zero tariffs on a number of strategic products,\u201d like all aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals, certain generic drugs, semiconductor equipment, some agricultural products, natural resources and critical raw materials.",
      "It is unclear if alcohol will be included in that list.",
      "\u201cAnd we will keep working to add more products to this list,\u201d she said, while also stressing that the \u201cframework means the figures we have just explained to the public, but, of course, details have to be sorted out. And that will happen over the next weeks.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, there will be work to do on other fronts. Von der Leyen had a mandate to negotiate because the European Commission handles trade for member countries. But the Commission must now present the deal to member states and EU lawmakers, who will ultimately decide whether or not to approve it.",
      "Before their meeting began, Trump pledged to change what he characterized as \u201ca very one-sided transaction, very unfair to the United States.\u201d",

It didn't mention the school or that the victims included children. Photos of the aftermath, which showed a half-dozen people lying in the street, were scrubbed from China\u2019s closely controlled internet.",

      "The ruling Communist Party has expanded information control since leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, seeing it as a way to prevent unrest. More and more topics, from negative news about the economy to LGBTQ+ identity, have become subject to some form of censorship. In the past half year, mass attacks \u2014 in which a person kills or injures multiple people with a vehicle or knife \u2014 appear to have been added to the list.",
      "Some people in China are pushing back, complaining online in at least two cases in recent months after drivers hit pedestrians.",
      "The government may be trying to prevent copycat crimes, experts have said. Another motivation could be local authorities wanting to cover up when they fail to do so.",
      "There was a spate of attacks last fall, but it\u2019s difficult to gauge whether they are increasing, given the dearth of information.",
      "The attacks weren\u2019t always a taboo topic. In the past, authorities released the basic details. Typically, the assailant was described as taking out their anger on society, often over financial losses.",
      "That appears to have changed following a particularly horrific case in November that killed 35 people in Zhuhai in southern China. Authorities said the driver was upset about a divorce settlement. Orders came from the very top \u2014 from Xi \u2014 to take steps to prevent similar attacks.",

      "The clampdown on information has tightened further since. In April, reports circulated online that a car had run into people outside a primary school in Jinhua city. At least three provincial state media outlets posted stories \u2014 but they were quickly taken down. To date, authorities haven\u2019t released any information.",

      "Since then, local authorities, at least in two cases in Beijing, seem to be taking a new approach: Issue a report quickly but with scant details.",
      "Eleven days after the drunk driving case, a car hit people outside an elementary school in Beijing on May 15. The Beijing Traffic Police issued a report within a few hours but left out that the location was near a school.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible. You really at least want to have somebody say, \u2018Thank you,\u2019\u201d Trump said.",
      "The president added, \u201cIt makes you feel a little bad when you do that\" without what he considered proper acknowledgement.",
      "Starmer is under pressure from his Labour Party lawmakers to follow France in recognizing a Palestinian state, a move both Israel and the U.S. have condemned. The British leader says the U.K. supports statehood for the Palestinians but that it must be \u201cpart of a wider plan\u201d for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.",
      "Also on Monday's agenda, according to Starmer\u2019s office, are efforts to promote a possible peace deal to end fighting in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine \u2014 particularly efforts at forcing Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table in the next 50 days.",
      "Trump in the past sharply criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for also failing to express enough public gratitude toward U.S. support for his country, taking a similar tack he's now adopting when it comes to aid for Gaza. The president, though, has shifted away from that tone and more sharply criticized Putin and Russia in recent weeks.",

He's gone out of his way to work with Trump, flattering the president repeatedly during a February visit to the White House, and teaming up to announce a joint trade framework on tariffs for some key products in May.",
      "Starmer and Trump then signed a trade agreement during the G7 summit in Canada that freed the U.K.'s aerospace sector from U.S. tariffs and used quotas to reduce them on auto-related industries from 25% to 10% while increasing the amount of U.S. beef it pledged to import.",
      "Discussions with Starmer follow a Trump meeting Sunday with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at his Turnberry course. They announced a trade framework that will put 15% tariffs on most goods from both countries, though many major details remain pending.",
      "The president has for months railed against yawning U.S. trade deficits around the globe and sees tariffs as a way to try and close them in a hurry. But the U.S. ran an $11.4 billion trade surplus with Britain last year, meaning it exported more to the U.K. than it imported. Census Bureau figures this year indicate that the surplus could grow.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rebuffed overtures by South Korea\u2019s new liberal government, saying Monday that its \u201cblind trust\u201d in the country's alliance with the U.S. and hostility toward North Korea make it no different from its conservative predecessor.",
      "Kim Yo Jong\u2019s comments imply that North Korea \u2014 now preoccupied with its expanding cooperation with Russia \u2014 sees no need to resume diplomacy with South Korea and the U.S. anytime soon. Experts say she likely hopes to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington.",
      "\u201cWe clarify once again the official stand that no matter what policy is adopted and whatever proposal is made in Seoul, we have no interest in it and there is neither a reason to meet nor an issue to be discussed,\u201d Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by state media.",
      "It's North Korea's first official statement on the government of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, which took office in early June with a promise to improve badly frayed ties with North Korea.",
      "Lee's government has halted anti-Pyongyang frontline loudspeaker broadcasts, taken steps to ban activists from flying balloons with propaganda leaflets across the border and repatriated North Koreans who were drifted south in wooden boats months earlier.",
      "North Korea has shunned talks with South Korea and the U.S. since leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over international sanctions. North Korea has since focused on building more powerful nuclear weapons targeting its rivals and declared a hostile \u201ctwo-state\u201d system on the Korean Peninsula to terminate relations with South Korea.",
      "Kim Yo Jong called Lee's steps \u201csincere efforts\u201d to develop ties, but said the new government still plots to \u201cstand in confrontation\u201d with North Korea. She mentioned the upcoming summertime South Korea-U.S. military drills, which North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal.",
      "Lee said it's important to restore trust between the Koreas as he met Unification Minister Chung Dong-young and asked about his thought on the latest North Korean statement. Chung, whose job makes him the top South Korean official on North Korea, later told reporters that he intends to propose to Lee that South Korea and the U.S. \u201cadjust\u201d their military exercises.",
      "Chung's remarks, which could mean scaling back South Korea-U.S. training as a way to get North Korea to return to talks, will likely invite strong criticism from conservatives, who support expanded South Korea-U.S. training to cope with North Korea's advancing nuclear program.",
      "Moon Seong Mook, an analyst for the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, said Kim Yo Jong's statement shows North Korea is holding out for South Korea to abandon the U.S. alliance.",

      "The Russian Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 99 Ukrainian drones over several regions overnight. Later in the day, it said another 51 drones were shot down near St. Petersburg.

      "The import tax that began July 14 is just the latest protectionist move by an administration that has threatened dozens of countries with tariffs, including its critical trading partner Mexico. It comes as the Mexican government tries to also negotiate its way out of a 30% general tariff scheduled to take effect Aug. 1.",

      "U.S. and Chinese officials are meeting in Stockholm to discuss trade tariffs.",
      "WASHINGTON -- When top U.S. and Chinese officials meet in Stockholm, they are almost certain to agree to at least leaving tariffs at the current levels while working toward a meeting between their presidents later this year for a more lasting trade deal between the world's two largest economies, analysts say.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are set to hold talks Monday for the third time this year \u2014 this round in the Swedish capital, nearly four months after President Donald Trump upset global trade with his sweeping tariff proposal, including an import tax that shot up to 145% on Chinese goods.",
      "\u201cWe have the confines of a deal with China,\u201d Trump said Friday before leaving for Scotland.",
      "Bessent told MSNBC on Wednesday that the two countries after talks in Geneva and London have reached a \u201cstatus quo,\u201d with the U.S. taxing imported goods from China at 30% and China responding with a 10% tariff, on top of tariffs prior to the start of Trump's second term.",
      "\u201cNow we can move on to discussing other matters in terms of bringing the economic relationship into balance,\u201d Bessent said. He was referring to the U.S. running a $295.5 billion trade deficit last year. The U.S. seeks an agreement that would enable it to export more to China and shift the Chinese economy more toward domestic consumer spending.",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington said Beijing hopes \u201cthere will be more consensus and cooperation and less misperception\u201d coming out of the talks.",
      "With an eye on a possible leaders' summit, Stockholm could provide some answers as to the timeline and viability of that particular goal ahead of a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "\u201cThe meeting will be important in starting to set the stage for a fall meeting between Trump and Xi,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator and now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cBeijing will likely insist on detailed preparations before they agree to a leaders\u2019 meeting.\u201d",
      "In Stockholm, the two sides are likely to focus on commercial announcements to be made at a leaders\u2019 summit as well as agreements to address \u201cmajor irritants,\u201d such as China's industrial overcapacity and its lack of control over chemicals used to make fentanyl, also to be announced when Xi and Trump should meet, Cutler said.",
      "Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said Stockholm could be the first real opportunity for the two governments to address structural reform issues including market access in China for U.S. companies.",
      "What businesses will be seeking coming out of Stockholm would largely be \u201cthe atmosphere\u201d \u2014 how the two sides characterize the discussions. They will also look for clues about a possible leaders\u2019 summit because any real deal will hinge on the two presidents meeting each other, he said.",
      "In Stockholm, Beijing will likely demand the removal of the 20% fentanyl-related tariff that Trump imposed earlier this year, said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center.",
      "This round of the U.S.-China trade dispute began with fentanyl, when Trump in February imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, citing that China failed to curb the outflow of the chemicals used to make the drug. The following month, Trump added another 10% tax for the same reason. Beijing retaliated with extra duties on some U.S. goods, including coal, liquefied natural gas, and farm products such as beef, chicken, pork and soy.",
      "In Geneva, both sides climbed down from three-digit tariffs rolled out following Trump's \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April, but the U.S. kept the 20% \u201cfentanyl\u201d tariffs, in addition to the 10% baseline rate \u2014 to which China responded by keeping the same 10% rate on U.S. products. These across-the-board duties were unchanged when the two sides met in London a month later to negotiate over non-tariff measures such as export controls on critical products.",
      "The Chinese government has long protested that American politicians blame China for the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. but argued the root problem lies with the U.S. itself. Washington says Beijing is not doing enough to regulate precursor chemicals that flow out of China into the hands of drug dealers.",

      "China's industrial overcapacity is as much a headache for the United States as it is for the European Union. Even Beijing has acknowledged the problem but suggested it might be difficult to address.",
      "America\u2019s trade imbalance with China has decreased from a peak of $418 billion in 2018, according to the Census Bureau. But China has found new markets for its goods and as the world\u2019s dominant manufacturer ran a global trade surplus approaching $1 trillion last year \u2014 somewhat larger than the size of the U.S. overall trade deficit in 2024. And China\u2019s emergence as a manufacturer of electric vehicles and other emerging technologies has suddenly made it more of a financial and geopolitical threat for those same industries based in the U.S., Europe, Japan and South Korea.",
      "\u201cSome enterprises, especially manufacturing enterprises, feel more deeply that China\u2019s manufacturing capabilities are too strong, and Chinese people are too hardworking. Factories run 24 hours a day,\u201d Chinese Premier Li Qiang said on Thursday when hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Beijing. \u201cSome people think this will cause some new problems in the balance of supply and demand in world production.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe see this problem too,\u201d Li said.",
      "Bessent also said the Stockholm talks could address Chinese purchases of Russian and Iranian oil. However, Wildau of Teneo said China could demand some U.S. security concessions in exchange, such as a reduced U.S. military presence in East Asia and scaled-back diplomatic support for Taiwan and the Philippines. This would likely face political pushback in Washington.",
      "The Stockholm talks will be \u201cgeared towards building a trade agreement based around Chinese purchase commitments and pledges of investment in the U.S. in exchange for partial relief from U.S. tariffs and export controls,\u201d Wildau said.",

      "\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis probably the preferred outcome for China hawks in the Trump administration, who worry that an overeager Trump might offer too much to Xi.\u201d",

      "Laughter filled Hall H as some 6,000 watched a montage of Coyote being blown up, flattened and falling into chasms in a scene set to Johnny Cash\u2019s cover of \u201cHurt.\u201d Coyote is replaying the moments in his lair when an ad for a personal injury lawyer appears on TV.",
      "They also played six minutes of the movie, including a scene of opening statements in the case in which Coyote's lawyer, Will Forte, accidentally unleashes a rocket skate into the courtroom, setting Coyote and the judge's robes on fire. Cena plays a slick Acme lawyer who wins over the jury, which includes a cartoon character, quickly.",
      "Forte said he didn't think the movie would ever get to audiences.",

      "\u201cIn my career \u2013 business and with the league and others \u2013 you see examples where maybe people stay on a little too long, so I think this serves the Packers well,\u201d Murphy said.",

      "There were plenty of shouts of \u201cThank you, Mark,\u201d among the 6,529 shareholders in the Lambeau Field stands. On a hot afternoon, many shareholders tried to cool themselves off by waving fans that featured Murphy\u2019s face. A tribute video included messages from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue among others.",

But (I\u2019m) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.\u201d",
      "The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team\u2019s chief executive. He was on Washington\u2019s 1982 championship team.",
      "His stint as Green Bay\u2019s president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments.",
      "He capped his tenure earlier this year by welcoming the NFL Draft to Green Bay, an event that drew an announced three-day total attendance of 600,000. Murphy also presided over multiple renovations to Lambeau Field, including the opening of a new home locker room this week.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been tremendous for us,\u201d wide receiver Jayden Reed said. \u201cI thanked him today, knowing this was his last day here, so I went up to him and I thanked him for everything. Without him, we wouldn\u2019t be standing in this locker room right now. He\u2019s been a tremendous help to all of us, very supportive. He gets this thing done. I appreciate him for that.\u201d",

Additionally, the card will offer points for everyday spending, as well as a $300 hotel credit and a $200 \u201csplurge\u201d credit at brands like Best Buy, Live Nation and others.",
      "Citi has had other forays into the high-end credit card market. The company launched Citi Prestige in 2013 as a direct competitor to the American Express Platinum Card, and the card won high praise from travel fanatics when it debuted for its hefty rewards program and perks.",

      "Talks between Iranian and European diplomats in Istanbul have ended with the sides agreeing to meet again to seek to unpick the deadlock over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program",
      "ISTANBUL -- Talks between Iranian and European diplomats in Istanbul ended Friday with the sides agreeing to meet again to seek to unpick the deadlock over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Representatives from Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3 nations, gathered at the Iranian Consulate building for the first talks since Iran\u2019s 12-day war with Israel in June, which involved U.S. bombers striking nuclear-related facilities.",
      "The talks, which ended after four hours, centered on the possibility of reimposing sanctions on Iran that were lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran accepting restrictions and monitoring of its nuclear program.",
      "Iranian negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi, said that the \u201cserious, frank and detailed\u201d meeting focused on the nuclear issue and the status of sanctions while agreeing to further discussions.",
      "The E3 nations had earlier warned that sanctions could return under a process known as the \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism, which allows one of the Western parties to reimpose U.N. sanctions if Tehran doesn't comply with its requirements.",
      "\u201cBoth sides came to the meeting with specific ideas,\u201d Gharibabadi said in a social media post. \u201cIt was agreed that consultations on this matter will continue.\u201d",
      "As the talks were ongoing, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Esmail Baghaei, said that he hoped that the meeting would see the E3 nations reassess their \u201cprevious unconstructive attitude.\u201d",
      "European leaders have said sanctions will resume by the end of August, if there is no progress on containing Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "The snapback mechanism \u201cremains on the table,\" a European diplomat said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks,",
      "\u201cA possible delay in triggering snapback has been floated to the Iranians on the condition that there is credible diplomatic engagement by Iran, that they resume full cooperation with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), and that they address concerns about their highly-enriched uranium stockpile,\u201d the diplomat said prior to Friday\u2019s negotiations.",
      "Tehran, meanwhile, has said that Washington, which withdrew from the 2015 deal during the first term of U.S. President Donald Trump, needs to rebuild faith in its role in negotiations.",
      "Gharibabadi previously said that Iran\u2019s engagement was dependent on \u201cseveral key principles\u201d that included \u201crebuilding Iran\u2019s trust \u2014 as Iran has absolutely no trust in the United States.\u201d",
      "In a social media post on Thursday, he also said that the talks shouldn\u2019t be used \u201cas a platform for hidden agendas such as military action.\u201d Gharibabadi insisted that Iran\u2019s right to enrich uranium \u201cin line with its legitimate needs\u201d be respected, and sanctions removed.",
      "Iran has repeatedly threatened to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which commits it to refrain from developing nuclear weapons, if sanctions return.",
      "Friday\u2019s talks were held at the deputy ministerial level, with Iran sending Gharibabadi and a fellow deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-e Ravanchi. A similar meeting was held in Istanbul in May. The identity of the E3 representatives weren't immediately clear, but the European Union\u2019s deputy foreign policy commissioner was thought to be attending.",
      "The U.K., France and Germany were signatories to the 2015 deal, alongside the U.S., Russia and China. When Washington withdrew in 2018, Trump insisted the agreement wasn\u2019t tough enough. Under the original deal, neither Russia nor China can veto reimposed sanctions.",

      "Nonprofits in the Bronx are facing severe challenges as federal grant cuts disrupt essential services",
      "NEW YORK -- On a sweltering summer day, children leap between rocks along the Bronx River while cyclists pedal on newly paved paths. Kayaks rest on what was once an industrial dumping ground, now transformed into a bustling promenade along the city\u2019s only freshwater river.",
      "The Bronx River Greenway, a series of stitched-together waterfront parks built atop once largely abandoned and polluted wasteland, is a hard-fought victory for the country\u2019s poorest congressional district \u2014 one that locals call a \u201cbeacon of environmental justice\u201d built by federal dollars and water-pollution settlements from the borough\u2019s wealthier neighbors.",
      "Now, like thousands of nonprofits around the country, this organization\u2019s future is in jeopardy. The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping federal grant cuts have left nonprofits nationwide and the communities they serve in precarious straits. But few places face as stark a reckoning as the Bronx, where federal funding has proved indispensable for revitalizing green spaces, protecting survivors of domestic violence, and preventing youth violence.",
      "Over 84% of the 342 nonprofits based in the Bronx rely on federal grants now at risk, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It\u2019s a significant increase from the 70% of groups vulnerable to government defunding statewide.",
      "In all but two of the country\u2019s 437 congressional districts, the typical nonprofit could not cover its expenses without government grants. Nonprofits have increasingly served as contractors for government services \u2014 like operating homeless shelters \u2014 since the 1960s.",
      "In the Bronx, if such grants were to disappear entirely, the borough\u2019s nonprofits could face a collective deficit of nearly 30% \u2014 cuts that have begun to force layoffs and austerity on dozens of groups connecting Bronxites to low-cost health care, food assistance, and preschool slots.",
      "\u201cWhen America sneezes, the Bronx gets the flu,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, the Democrat who represents the district. \u201cI think we in the Bronx feel we have been and will continue to be the hardest hit by the impact of a Trump presidency.\u201d",
      "Nestled in a corner of parkland atop the site of an abandoned amusement park, the headquarters of the Bronx River Alliance is among the borough\u2019s greenest buildings, boasting nature classrooms, samples of the river\u2019s flora and fauna, and a storage space teeming with kayaks and canoes.",
      "In March, the group received formal notice that it would lose $1.5 million in federal grants promised under the Inflation Reduction Act last year for improving water quality and climate-resilience projects. After years of rising momentum, cubicles now sit empty. Leaders held off on hiring in anticipation of cuts, and now they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to fill those roles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve met some of the folks who were pulling cars out of the river in the \u201970s and \u201980s,\u201d said Daniel Ranells, the group\u2019s deputy director of programs. Back then, the area was a \u201cdumping ground\u201d so inundated with industrial waste, tires, abandoned cars, ovens, and microwaves that \u201cfolks didn\u2019t really understand there was a river there.\u201d",
      "That has shifted dramatically in recent years thanks in part to decades of federal investment. Just south of its headquarters, the organization restored salt marshes along the riverbanks of a shuttered concrete plant.",
      "In 2007, the first beaver appeared on the Bronx River in over 200 years \u2014 named \u201cJos\u00e9 the Beaver\u201d in honor of former Congressman Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, who helped direct millions in federal funds to groups dedicated to the river\u2019s restoration.",
      "\u201cThe Bronx River is a shining light of environmental justice,\u201d Ranells said, and millions in federal funding over the years has helped \u201cmake it a destination\u201d after years of neglect.",
      "Now staffers at the Bronx River Alliance describe a sense of \u201cwhiplash\u201d in seeing hard-fought funds dry up and grant language scrubbed of any allusions to racial or environmental justice.",
      "The Bronx River Alliance has joined other nonprofits in suing the Trump administration to unfreeze funds, but the uncertainty has already disrupted years of planning, a reality that has rippled across the neighborhood, leaving few organizations untouched.",
      "Up the street from the Alliance, the office of the Osborne Association, a group that has worked to prevent youth violence for nearly a century, has grown quieter. In April, an email from the Bureau of Justice Assistance stated the remaining $666,000 of a $2 million grant \u201cno longer effectuates department priorities.\u201d",

      "The cut thrust the nonprofit into \u201ctriage mode,\u201d said Osborne president Jonathan Monsalve, who was forced to lay off three staffers and reduce the number of participants in a diversion program offering young adults facing gun charges an alternative to jail time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline for young people, and it\u2019s no longer there for 25 more of them,\u201d Monsalve said. \u201cWithout another alternative, it\u2019s 25 young people that will see prison or jail time, and that\u2019s incredibly frustrating.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has canceled over $810 million in similar grants to nonprofits working in violence prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency attempted to cancel $2 billion in grants for environmental justice work.",
      "Nonprofit leaders say the cuts hit hardest in the places that can afford them the least. In the Bronx, almost 30 percent of residents live in poverty, the vast majority of whom are Black or Latino, and nearly one in six schoolchildren experience homelessness every year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of disinvestment in these communities, and we had been starting to see some meaningful investment and community-based solutions that were actually working,\u201d said Monsalve. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden that support just gets yanked away.\u201d",

      "For decades, a million-dollar federal grant allowed the victim-service organization Safe Horizon to operate a program that stationed domestic violence advocates in the borough\u2019s criminal court.",

      "It was an agonizing decision given the volume of domestic violence in the Bronx, Roberts said.",

      "Roberts said she\u2019s bracing for more cuts \u2014 federal funds make up about 24% of the group\u2019s budget \u2014 that could force the closure of shelters or reductions to a citywide hotline.",
      "As nonprofits nationwide grapple with similar losses, Roberts said private philanthropy and local governments will need to \u201cmake some smart and thoughtful and principled decisions about where they can help to fill those gaps.\u201d",
      "In places like the Bronx, finding alternative funding is especially challenging. \u201cThe not-for-profit sector is often fragile, and nowhere more so than the Bronx,\u201d Torres said of the district he represents, where organizations tend to be more dependent on government funding than wealthier enclaves.",
      "\u201cOrganizations spent hundreds of thousands of dollars simply to apply for a contract and hired staff and made all these plans only to see the written contract disappear,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply destabilizing.\u201d",

      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help",
      "NEW YORK -- After five years of working long nights as a truck driver, Julius Mosley wanted a change. He found driving unfulfilling, and his teenage son needed him to spend more time at home.",
      "So Mosley took a job as a customer service representative at a telecommunications company near his home. The employee benefits included being able to take job-related classes for free. He decided he wanted to study leadership so he could learn about managing teams and helping people become the best versions of themselves.",
      "His company, Spectrum, paid for a 10-week front-line manager certificate program that Mosley went on to complete. Then it covered the tuition cost for a bachelor's degree in leadership and organization studies that he's currently pursuing. The company also promoted him to a management position while he took college courses online.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely changed the course of my life,\u201d Mosley said about the education benefit, which took care of his tuition up front instead of requiring him to pay and seek later reimbursement. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a blessing to be able to do this.\u201d",
      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help defraying the expense of college and professional credentials. Nearly half of public and private employers have a tuition reimbursement program for employees, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, or SHRM.",
      "Many employers that provide tuition assistance reimburse staff members up to $5,250 per year because that amount is tax-deductible, said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute, which offers credentials to HR professionals.",
      "Some companies offer more, including Bank of America, which provides tuition assistance of up to $7,500 annually, and Spectrum which, in addition to its prepaid tuition program, reimburses employees earning master's degrees or enrolled in classes that fall outside the scope of its prepaid program up to $10,000 per year.",
      "\"For companies who are looking to attract Generation Z and Millennials, it\u2019s a great way to bring them in because they\u2019re keenly interested in how companies are investing in them and the benefits that are available,\" said Dufrane.",
      "Because many college graduates start jobs after accumulating student loan debt, about 8% of employers also offer help with student loan repayment, according to James Atkinson, vice president of thought leadership at SHRM.",
      "If continuing education feels out of reach financially or seems incompatible with job demands, experts say there are ways to explore the possibility, either by by making the case to your employer or seeking a position at a place that provides education benefits.",
      "In traditional tuition reimbursement programs, employees lay out thousands of dollars to pay for tuition, books and fees at the start of a semester, and usually must complete the course with a passing grade before a company would kick in its contribution.",
      "That means employees would often wait four to six months before being reimbursed, which only works for more affluent workers, said Paul Marchand, chief human resources officer at Spectrum.",
      "\u201cThe person that can afford to put it on their credit card and sit with $3- or $4- or $5,000 of expenses due back to them and not be concerned about that cost, that is not our average worker,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cOur average worker is making $25, $28, $30 bucks an hour, maybe having a second job, maybe a single parent with kids, ... and they\u2019re important workers for us, and we want to help develop them and grow their careers.\u201d",
      "Spectrum launched a program that lets employees sign up for an array of certificates or college courses while paying nothing themselves. The eligible courses and where to take them came from Guild, a Denver company that works with employers on workforce development and tuition assistance.",
      "Walmart offers a similar benefit to its front-line associates, who can enroll in college or certain classes without ever seeing an invoice, according to company spokesperson Jimmy Carter. The benefit also extends to family members of the employees, he said.",
      "As recent college graduates have struggled with debts from college, some employers have added student loan repayment programs as well as tuition assistance.",

      "\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m now ahead of where I thought I would be a little over a year ago is very nice to see,\u201d she said.",

      "Show how a course or training directly relates to your role and how it would help you do your job more effectively, Dufrane advised. Even if there's no formal tuition reimbursement program, your employer might have a training or professional development budget.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re taking on a stretch role or entering a new industry, you can advocate for training as part of your offer. Say something like, \u2018I\u2019d like to take a course to help me get up to speed in this area.\u2019 In my experience, that shows initiative and employers often respect it,\u201d Dufrane said.",

      "Providing flexibility shows commitment to employees, Dufrane said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be flexible around learning because people have parents they\u2019re taking care of and kids they're taking care of, and going home at night isn\u2019t always the best time to be writing a paper,\u201d she said.",
      "Fitting in schoolwork while also meeting the needs of a son, a fiancee, a full-time job and a puppy has been challenging for Mosley, but it also provided a way to model studious behavior for his son.",
      "\u201cInstead of me just telling him he needs to do his, now he\u2019s seeing me doing schoolwork, so that actually helped out with him wanting to do his work more,\" Mosley said. \"We actually take time to sit down together some days to work on our homework, so it\u2019s been a life-changing situation.\u201d",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a flurry of trade deals that will relieve some pressure on companies and consumers from sharply higher tariffs on imports from Japan and a handful of other Asian countries",
      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump has announced trade deals with Japan and a handful of other Asian countries that will relieve some pressure on companies and consumers from sharply higher tariffs on their exports to the United States.",
      "A deal with China is under negotiation, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying an Aug. 12 deadline might be postponed again to allow more time for talks.",
      "Steep tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum remain, however, and many other countries, including South Korea and Thailand, have yet to clinch agreements. Overall, economists say the tariffs inevitably will dent growth in Asia and the world.",
      "Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced a deal Wednesday that will impose 15% tariffs on U.S. imports from Japan, down from Trump's proposed 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.",
      "It was a huge relief for automakers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda, whose shares jumped by double digits in Tokyo. Trump also announced trade deals with the Philippines and Indonesia. After meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., Trump said the import tax on products from his country would be subject to a 19% tariff, down just 1% from the earlier threat of a 20% tariff.",
      "Indonesia also will face a 19% tariff, down from the 32% rate Trump had recently said would apply, and it committed to eliminating nearly all of its trade barriers for imports of American goods. Earlier, Trump announced that Vietnam's exports would face a 20% tariff, with double that rate for goods transshipped from China, though there has been no formal announcement.",
      "Negotiations with China are subject to an Aug. 12 deadline, but it's likely to be extended, Bessent told Fox Business on Tuesday. He said the two sides were due to hold another round of talks, this time in Sweden, early next week. Meanwhile, Trump said a trip to China may happen soon, hinting at efforts to stabilize U.S.-China trade relations.",
      "A preliminary agreement announced in June paved the way for China to lift some restrictions on its exports of rare earths, minerals critical for high technology and other manufacturing. In May, the U.S. agreed to drop Trump's 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, while China agreed to lower its 125% rate on U.S. goods to 10%.

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Bubba Wallace climbed out of the No. 23 car Sunday, pumped his fists, found his family and savored every precious moment of a historic Brickyard 400 victory.",
      "He deserved every minute of it.",
      "The 31-year-old Wallace overcame a tenuous 18-minute rain delay, two tantalizing overtimes, fears about running out of fuel late and the hard-charging defending race champ, Kyle Larson, on back-to-back restarts to become the first Black driver to win a major race on Indianapolis Motor Speedway's 2.5-mile oval. No Black driver has won the Indianapolis 500, and Formula 1 raced on the track\u2019s road course.",

It also snapped a 100-race winless streak that dated to 2022 at Kansas and locked up a playoff spot. His only other win came at Talladega in 2021.",

      "In Wallace's mind, there was no choice.",
      "\u201cThe first thing that went through my mind was, \u2018Here we go again,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut then I said, `I want to win this straight up. I want to go back racing.' Here we are.\u201d",
      "He beat Larson off the restart again and pulled away, preventing Larson from becoming the race's fourth back-to-back winner.",
      "The victory also alleviated the frustration Wallace felt Saturday when he spent most of the qualifying session on the provisional pole only to see Chase Briscoe claim the No. 1 starting spot with one of the last runs in the session.",
      "On Sunday, he made sure there was no repeat, providing an added boost to the 23XI Racing team co-owned by basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and last week\u2019s race winner, Denny Hamlin, as it continues to battle NASCAR in court over its charter status.",
      "\u201cThose last 20 laps there were ups and downs and I was telling myself \u2018You won\u2019t be able to do it,\u2019\u201d Wallace said. \u201cOnce I\u2019d seen it was Larson, I knew he won here last year and he\u2019s arguably the best in the field.

I\u2019m going to take it in and enjoy the moment, but with the understanding I\u2019ve got to get ready to play tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Five days before the trade deadline, it was the kind of night that recalled his best season, when he had 30 homers and 30 steals in 2021 while earning his lone All-Star appearance.",
      "Mullins is eligible for free agency this fall. That could make him one of the easier players to deal for a Baltimore club that began Saturday nine games out of the final AL Wild Card spot. Saturday's performance just might remind another team what he has to offer beyond some lackluster 2025 numbers.",
      "Mullins has 14 home runs but is batting .219 with a .297 on-base percentage with 45 RBIs and 14 stolen bases in 87 games. His .706 OPS is only slightly below his career average.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d interim manager Tony Mansolino said pregame when asked why Mullins had never duplicated his 2021 level. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him be the 30-30 guy for stretches. \u2026 For me, he\u2019s been searching for his swing here kind of off and on all year this year.\u201d",

      "People with experimental brain implants often turn to the treatment as a last resort, hoping to improve their health when everything else has failed",
      "Carol Seeger finally escaped her debilitating depression with an experimental treatment that placed electrodes in her brain and a pacemaker-like device in her chest. But when its batteries stopped working, insurance wouldn\u2019t pay to fix the problem and she sank back into a dangerous darkness.",
      "She worried for her life, asking herself: \u201cWhy am I putting myself through this?\u201d",
      "Seeger\u2019s predicament highlights a growing problem for hundreds of people with experimental neural implants, including those for depression, quadriplegia and other conditions. Although these patients take big risks to advance science, there's no guarantee that their devices will be maintained \u2014 particularly after they finish participating in clinical trials \u2014 and no mechanism requiring companies or insurers to do so.",
      "A research project led by Gabriel L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz, a Harvard University scientist, aimed to change that by creating partnerships between players in the burgeoning implant field to overcome barriers to device access and follow-up care.",
      "But the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health grants by the Trump administration this year left the project in limbo, dimming hope for Seeger and others like her who wonder what will happen to their health and progress.",
      "Unlike medications, implanted devices often require parts, maintenance, batteries and surgeries when changes are needed. Insurance typically covers such expenses for federally approved devices considered medically necessary, but not experimental ones.",
      "A procedure to replace a battery alone can cost more than $15,000 without insurance, L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz said.",
      "While companies stand to profit from research, \u201cthere\u2019s really nothing that helps ensure that device manufacturers have to provide any of these parts or cover any kind of maintenance,\u201d said L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz.",
      "Some companies also move on to newer versions of devices or abandon the research altogether, which can leave patients in an uncertain place.",
      "Medtronic, the company that made the deep brain stimulation, or DBS, technology Seeger used, said in a statement that every study is different and that the company puts patient safety first when considering care after studies end.",
      "People consider various possibilities when they join a clinical trial.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration requires the informed consent process to include a description of \u201creasonably foreseeable risks and discomforts to the participant,\u201d a spokesperson said. However, the FDA doesn\u2019t require trial plans to include procedures for long-term device follow-up and maintenance, although the spokesperson stated that the agency has requested those in the past.",
      "While some informed consent forms say devices will be removed at a study\u2019s end, L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz said removal is ethically problematic when a device is helping a patient. Plus, he said, some trial participants told him and his colleagues that they didn\u2019t remember everything discussed during the consent process, partly because they were so focused on getting better.",
      "Brandy Ellis, a 49-year-old in Boynton Beach, Florida, said she was desperate for healing when she joined a trial testing the same treatment Seeger got, which delivers an electrical current into the brain to treat severe depression. She was willing to sign whatever forms were necessary to get help after nothing else had worked.",
      "\u201cI was facing death,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it was most definitely consent at the barrel of a gun, which is true for a lot of people who are in a terminal condition.\u201d",
      "Ellis and Seeger, 64, both turned to DBS as a last resort after trying many approved medications and treatments.",

      "She\u2019s now on her third battery. She needed surgery to replace two single-use ones, and the one she has now is rechargeable. She\u2019s lucky her insurance has covered the procedures, she said, but she worries it may not in the future.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t count on any coverage because there\u2019s nothing that says even though I\u2019ve had this and it works, that it has to be covered under my commercial or any other insurance,\u201d said Ellis, who advocates for other former trial participants.",
      "Even if companies still make replacement parts for older devices, she added, \u201cavailability and accessibility are entirely different things,\u201d given most people can\u2019t afford continued care without insurance coverage.",
      "Seeger, whose device was implanted in 2012 at Emory, said she went without a working device for around four months when the insurance coverage her wife\u2019s job at Emory provided wouldn\u2019t pay for battery replacement surgery. Neither would Medicare, which generally only covers DBS for FDA-approved uses.",
      "With her research team at Emory advocating for her, Seeger ultimately got financial help from the hospital's indigent care program and paid a few thousand dollars out of pocket.",
      "She now has a rechargeable battery, and the device has been working well. But at any point, she said, that could change.",
      "L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz hoped his work would protect people like Seeger and Ellis.",
      "\u201cWe should do whatever we can as a society to be able to help them maintain their health,\u201d he said.",
      "L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz's project received about $987,800 from the National Institute of Mental Health in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years and was already underway when he was notified of the NIH funding cut in May. He declined to answer questions about it.",
      "Ellis said any delay in addressing the thorny issues around experimental brain devices hurts patients.",
      "Planning at the beginning of a clinical trial about how to continue treatment and maintain devices, she said, would be much better than depending on the kindness of researchers and the whims of insurers.",
      "\u201cIf this turns off, I get sick again. Like, I\u2019m not cured,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a treatment that absolutely works, but only as long as I\u2019ve got a working device.\u201d",

      "Archaeologists in central Israel are excavating one of the world's oldest known burial sites, dating back 100,000 years",
      "SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.",
      "The findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.",
      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "Archaeologists have identified a 250-year-old shipwreck uncovered on a remote Scottish beach",
      "LONDON -- When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\u201cI would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that\u2019s wrecked,\u201d said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation.",
      "\u201cI think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland\u2019s northern tip.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since the 15th century.",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\u201cThat was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2013 everybody pulling together to get it back,\u201d said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island\u2019s community researchers. \u201cQuite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\u201d",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century. That was one bit of luck, Saunders said, because it coincides with \u201cthe point where British bureaucracy\u2019s really starting to kick off\u201d and detailed records were being kept.",
      "\u201cAnd so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\u201cYou remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\u201d",

      "Further research found that before it was the Earl of Chatham, the ship was HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in Chichester on England\u2019s south coast in 1749.",
      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain\u2019s failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",
      "A year later, while heading out to the whaling ground, it was wrecked in bad weather off Sanday. All 56 crew members survived \u2014 more evidence, Saunders says, that this was a vessel blessed with luck.",
      "The ship\u2019s timbers are being preserved in a freshwater tank at the Sanday Heritage Centre while plans are discussed to put it on permanent display.",
      "Saunders said that the project is a model of community involvement in archaeology.",
      "\u201cThe community have been so keen, have been so desirous to be involved and to find out things to learn, and they\u2019re so proud of it. It\u2019s down to them it was discovered, it\u2019s down to them it was recovered and it\u2019s been stabilized and been protected,\u201d he said.",
      "For locals, it\u2019s a link to the island\u2019s maritime past \u2014 and future. Finding long-buried wrecks could become more common as climate change alters the wind patterns around Britain and reshapes the coastline.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest things I\u2019ve got out of this project is realizing how much the past in Sanday is just constantly with you \u2014 either visible or just under the surface,\u201d said Ruth Peace, another community researcher.",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",
      "But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot.",
      "McGee responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d",
      "The case is expected to continue for two more weeks.",
      "In the California case, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing before an administrative judge that Tesla has misled drivers by exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",

      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",

      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

      "Tech companies selling AI to the federal government now face a new challenge: proving their chatbots aren't \"woke.\"",
      "Tech companies looking to sell their artificial intelligence technology to the federal government must now contend with a new regulatory hurdle: proving their chatbots aren't \u201cwoke.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's sweeping new plan to counter China in achieving \u201cglobal dominance\u201d in AI promises to cut regulations and cement American values into the AI tools increasingly used at work and home.",
      "But one of Trump\u2019s three AI executive orders signed Wednesday \u2014 the one \u201cpreventing woke AI in the federal government\u201d \u2014 marks the first time the U.S. government has explicitly tried to shape the ideological behavior of AI.",
      "Several leading providers of the AI language models targeted by the order \u2014 products like Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot \u2014 have so far been silent on Trump's anti-woke directive, which still faces a study period before it gets into official procurement rules.",
      "While the tech industry has largely welcomed Trump's broader AI plans, the anti-woke order forces the industry to leap into a culture war battle \u2014 or try their best to quietly avoid it.",
      "\u201cIt will have massive influence in the industry right now,\u201d especially as tech companies are already capitulating to other Trump administration directives, said civil rights advocate Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, senior director of The Leadership Conference\u2019s Center for Civil Rights and Technology.",
      "The move also pushes the tech industry to abandon years of work to combat the pervasive forms of racial and gender bias that studies and real-world examples have shown to be baked into AI systems.",
      "\u201cFirst off, there's no such thing as woke AI,\u201d Montoya-Boyer said. \u201cThere\u2019s AI technology that discriminates and then there\u2019s AI technology that actually works for all people.\u201d",
      "Molding the behaviors of AI large language models is challenging because of the way they\u2019re built and the inherent randomness of what they produce. They\u2019ve been trained on most of what\u2019s on the internet, reflecting the biases of all the people who\u2019ve posted commentary, edited a Wikipedia entry or shared images online.",
      "\u201cThis will be extremely difficult for tech companies to comply with,\u201d said former Biden administration official Jim Secreto, who was deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, an architect of many of President Joe Biden's AI industry initiatives. \u201cLarge language models reflect the data they\u2019re trained on, including all the contradictions and biases in human language.\u201d",
      "Tech workers also have a say in how they're designed, from the global workforce of annotators who check their responses to the Silicon Valley engineers who craft the instructions for how they interact with people.",
      "Trump's order targets those \u201ctop-down\u201d efforts at tech companies to incorporate what it calls the \u201cdestructive\u201d ideology of diversity, equity and inclusion into AI models, including \u201cconcepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.\u201d",
      "The directive has invited comparison to China's heavier-handed efforts to ensure that generative AI tools reflect the core values of the ruling Communist Party. Secreto said the order resembles China\u2019s playbook in \u201cusing the power of the state to stamp out what it sees as disfavored viewpoints.\"",
      "The method is different, with China relying on direct regulation by auditing AI models, approving them before they are deployed and requiring them to filter out banned content such as the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989.",
      "Trump's order doesn't call for any such filters, relying on tech companies to instead show that their technology is ideologically neutral by disclosing some of the internal policies that guide the chatbots.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is taking a softer but still coercive route by using federal contracts as leverage,\u201d Secreto said. \u201cThat creates strong pressure for companies to self-censor in order to stay in the government\u2019s good graces and keep the money flowing.\u201d",
      "The order's call for \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI echoes the language of the president's one-time ally and adviser Elon Musk, who has made it the mission of the Grok chatbot made by his company xAI.",

      "But whether Grok or its rivals will be favored under the new policy remains to be seen.",
      "Despite a \u201crhetorically pointed\u201d introduction laying out the Trump administration's problems with DEI, the actual language of the order's directives shouldn't be hard for tech companies to comply with, said Neil Chilson, a Republican former chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even prohibit an ideological agenda,\u201d just that any intentional methods to guide the model be disclosed, said Chilson, head of AI policy at the nonprofit Abundance Institute. \u201cWhich is pretty light touch, frankly.\u201d",
      "Chilson disputes comparisons to China's cruder modes of AI censorship.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing in this order that says that companies have to produce or cannot produce certain types of output,\u201d he said. \u201cIt says developers shall not intentionally encode partisan or ideological judgments.\u201d",
      "With their AI tools already widely used in the federal government, tech companies have reacted cautiously. OpenAI on Thursday said it is awaiting more detailed guidance but believes its work to make ChatGPT objective already makes the technology consistent with Trump's directive.",
      "Microsoft, a major supplier of online services to the government, declined to comment.",
      "Musk's xAI, through spokesperson Katie Miller, a former Trump official, pointed to a company comment praising Trump's AI announcements but didn't address the procurement order. xAI recently announced it was awarded a U.S. defense contract for up to $200 million, just days after Grok publicly posted a barrage of antisemitic commentary that praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Palantir didn't respond to emailed requests for comment Thursday.",
      "The ideas behind the order have bubbled up for more than a year on the podcasts and social media feeds of Trump's top AI adviser David Sacks and other influential Silicon Valley venture capitalists, many of whom endorsed Trump's presidential campaign last year. Their ire centered on Google's February 2024 release of an AI image-generating tool that produced historically inaccurate images before the tech giant took down and fixed the product.",
      "Google later explained that the errors \u2014 including generating portraits of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show American Founding Fathers \u2014 were the result of an overcompensation for technology that, left to its own devices, was prone to favoring lighter-skinned people because of pervasive bias in the systems.",
      "Trump allies alleged that Google engineers were hard-coding their own social agenda into the product.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 100% intentional,\u201d said prominent venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen on a podcast in December. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get Black George Washington at Google. There\u2019s override in the system that basically says, literally, \u2018Everybody has to be Black.\u2019 Boom. There\u2019s squads, large sets of people, at these companies who determine these policies and write them down and encode them into these systems.\u201d",
      "Sacks credited a conservative strategist who has fought DEI initiatives at colleges and workplaces for helping to draft the order.",
      "\u201cWhen they asked me how to define \u2018woke,\u2019 I said there\u2019s only one person to call: Chris Rufo. And now it\u2019s law: the federal government will not be buying WokeAI,\u201d Sacks wrote on X.",
      "Rufo responded that he helped \u201cidentify DEI ideologies within the operating constitutions of these systems.\u201d",
      "But some who agreed that Biden went too far promoting DEI also worry that Trump\u2019s new order sets a bad precedent for future government efforts to shape AI\u2019s politics.",
      "\u201cThe whole idea of achieving ideological neutrality with AI models is really just unworkable,\u201d said Ryan Hauser of the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank. \u201cAnd what do we get? We get these frontier labs just changing their speech to meet the political requirements of the moment.\u201d",

      "An artificial intelligence agenda that started coalescing on the podcasts of Silicon Valley billionaires is now being forged into U.S. policy as President Donald Trump leans on the ideas of the tech figures who backed his election campaign.",
      "Trump on Wednesday is planning to reveal an \u201cAI Action Plan\u201d he ordered after returning to the White House in January. He gave his tech advisers six months to come up with new AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden's signature AI guardrails on his first day in office.",
      "The unveiling is co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four tech investors and entrepreneurs who include Trump\u2019s AI czar, David Sacks.",
      "The plan and related executive orders are expected to include some familiar tech lobby pitches. That includes accelerating the sale of AI technology abroad and making it easier to construct the energy-hungry data center buildings that are needed to form and run AI products, according to a person briefed on Wednesday\u2019s event who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It might also include some of the AI culture war preoccupations of the circle of venture capitalists who endorsed Trump last year.",

      "\u201cThe AI\u2019s incapable of giving you accurate answers because it\u2019s been so programmed with diversity and inclusion,\u201d Sacks said at the time. Google quickly fixed its tool, but the \u201cBlack George Washington\u201d moment remained a parable for the problem of AI's perceived political bias, taken up by X owner Elon Musk, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Vice President JD Vance and Republican lawmakers.",

      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",

But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",

      "The new legislation also contained a ban on advertising of virtual private network services and fines for VPN resources that fail to comply with government regulations, but stopped short of banning their use. It did list the use of a VPN as an \u201caggravating circumstance\u201d in case of other violations of the law.",
      "Russians widely use VPN services for access to banned content, but authorities have sought to tighten restrictions, trying to close the loopholes. The state communications watchdog has increasingly used technology to analyze traffic and block specific VPN protocols.",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

      "Then there's the second ring of exposure \u2014 what happens after the video or photos spread.",
      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "Lawmakers on Maui have passed legislation aimed at eliminating a large percentage of the Hawaiian island\u2019s vacation rentals",
      "HONOLULU -- Lawmakers on Maui passed legislation Thursday aimed at eliminating a large percentage of the Hawaiian island's vacation rentals to address a housing shortage exacerbated by the wildfire that destroyed most of Lahaina two years ago.",
      "It's the latest action by a top global tourist destination to push back against the infiltration of vacationers into residential neighborhoods and tourism overwhelming their communities. In May, Spain ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform for having violated rules. Last month, thousands of protesters in European cities like Barcelona and Venice, Italy, marched against the ills of overtourism.",
      "The Maui County Council's housing committee voted 6-3 to pass the bill, which would close a loophole that has allowed owners of condos in apartment zones to rent their units for days or weeks at a time instead of a minimum of 180 days. The mandate would take effect in the West Maui district that includes Lahaina in 2028. The rest of the county would have until 2030 to comply.",
      "The council still needs to vote on the bill, but the committee's result is a strong indication of the final outcome because all nine council members sit on the housing panel. The mayor is expected to sign the bill, which he proposed.",
      "\"Bill 9 is a critical first step in restoring our commitment to prioritize housing for local residents \u2014 and securing a future where our keiki can live, grow, and thrive in the place they call home,\u201d Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said in a statement, using the Hawaiian word for children.",
      "Vacation rentals currently account for 21% of all housing in the county, which has a population of about 165,000 people.",
      "An analysis by University of Hawaii economists predicted the measure would add 6,127 units to Maui\u2019s long-term housing stock, increasing supply by 13%.",
      "Opponents questioned whether local residents could afford the condos in question, noting that many of the buildings they are in are aging and their units come with high mortgages, insurance payments, maintenance and special assessment costs.",
      "Alicia Humiston said her condo is in a hotel zone so it won't be affected. But she predicted the measure will hurt housekeepers, plumbers, electricians and other small business owners who help maintain vacation rentals.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s best for the the community,\u201d said Humiston, who is president of the Rentals by Owner Awareness Association.",
      "Bissen proposed the legislation last year after wildfire survivors and activists camped out on a beach popular with tourists to demand change.",

      "The University of Hawaii study said only about 600 new housing units are built in the county each year so converting the vacation rentals would be equivalent to a decade\u2019s worth of new housing development. Condo prices would drop 20-40%, the study estimated.",
      "The report also predicted one-quarter of Maui County\u2019s visitor accommodations would vanish and visitor spending would sink 15%. It estimated gross domestic product would contract by 4%.",
      "The mayor said such economic analysis failed to tell a full story, noting families are torn apart when high housing costs drive out relatives and that cultural knowledge disappears when generations leave Maui.",
      "The mayor told the council the bill was one part of a broader housing strategy that would include building new housing, investing in infrastructure and stopping illegally operated vacation rentals. He said there were limits to how much new housing could be built because of constraints on water supplies and sewer infrastructure.",
      "Tourism would continue on Maui but must do so in a way \u201cthat doesn't hollow out our neighborhoods,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "The mayor's staff told council members that visitor spending would decline with the measure but most of the drop would be on lodging. Because 94% of those who own vacation rentals in apartment zones don't live on Maui, they said much of this income already flows off-island. They predicted the county budget could withstand an estimated $61 million decline in annual tax revenue resulting from the measure.",

      "In March 2023, the Biden administration made a sudden change in how the government processes green cards in the category that includes both abused minors and religious workers. It created new backlogs that threaten the ability of thousands of pastors, nuns, imams, cantors and others to remain in the United States.",
      "The bill only tackles one small part of the issue, which sponsoring lawmakers hope will increase its chances of passing even as immigration remains one of the most polarizing issues in the country.",
      "Faith leaders say even a narrow fix will be enough to prevent damaging losses to congregations and to start planning for the future again.",
      "\u201cUnless there is a change to current practice, our community is slowly being strangled,\u201d said the Rev. Aaron Wessman, vicar general and director of formation for the Glenmary Home Missioners, a small Catholic order ministering in rural America.",
      "\u201cI will weep with joy if this legislation passes,\" he said. \"It means the world for our members who are living in the middle of uncertainty and for the people they\u2019ll be able to help.\u201d",
      "Two thirds of Glenmary\u2019s priests and brothers under 50 years old are foreign-born \u2014 mostly from Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria and Uganda \u2014 and they are affected by the current immigration snag, Wessman added.",
      "So are thousands of others who serve the variety of faiths present in the United States, from Islam to Hinduism to evangelical Christianity, providing both pastoral care and social services.",
      "No exact numbers exist, but it is estimated that there are thousands of religious workers who are now backlogged in the green card system and/or haven\u2019t been able to apply yet.",
      "Congregations bring to the United States religious workers under temporary visas called R-1, which allow them to work for up to five years. That used to be enough time for the congregations to petition for green cards under a special category called EB-4, which would allow the clergy to become permanent residents.",
      "Congress sets a quota of green cards available per year divided in categories, almost all based on types of employment or family relationships to U.S. citizens. In most categories, the demand exceeds the annual quota.",
      "Citizens of countries with especially high demand get put in separate, often longer \u201clines\u201d \u2014 for several years, the most backlogged category has been that of married Mexican children of U.S. citizens, where only applications filed more than 24 years ago are being processed.",
      "Also in a separate line were migrant children with \u201cSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status\u201d \u2014 neglected or abused minors \u2014 from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Hundreds of thousands sought humanitarian green cards or asylum after illegally crossing into the U.S. since the mid-2010s, though the Trump administration recently cracked down on the program.",
      "In March 2023, the State Department suddenly started adding the minors to the general green card queue with the clergy. That has created such a bottleneck that in April, only halfway through the current fiscal year, those green cards became unavailable.",
      "And when they will become available in the new fiscal year starting in October, they are likely to be stuck in the six-year backlog they faced earlier this year \u2014 meaning religious workers with a pending application won\u2019t get their green cards before their five-year visas expire and they must leave the country.",
      "In a report released Thursday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services blamed the EB-4 backlogs on the surge in applications by minors from Central America, and said the agency found widespread fraud in that program.",

    "story": [
      "More than half a dozen Army bases\u2019 names were changed in 2023 because they honored Confederate leaders",
      "In 2023, amid a national reckoning on issues of race in America, seven Army bases' names were changed because they honored Confederate leaders.",
      "Now, those same bases are reverting back to their original names, this time with different namesakes who share Confederate surnames \u2014 the Army found other service members with the same last names to honor.",
      "The move is stirring up conversation in and outside military circles. Skeptics wonder if the true intention is to undermine efforts to move away from Confederate associations, an issue that has long split people who favor preserving an aspect of southern heritage and those who want slavery-supporting revels stripped of valor.",
      "Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, a civil rights group, said the latest renaming is a \u201cdifference without a distinction.\u201d",
      "The wiping away of names that were given by the Biden administration, many of which honored service members who were women or minorities, is the latest move by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to align with Trump\u2019s purging of all programs, policies, books and social media mentions of references to diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of the Army responded to emailed requests for comment.",
      "Federal law now bars the military from returning to honoring Confederates, but the move restores names know by generations of soldiers. Following the election of President Abraham Lincoln, who opposed the expansion of slavery, 11 southern states seceded from the United States to form the Confederacy, or the Confederate States of America, to preserve slavery an institution that enslaved millions of African Americans. Their secession led to the Civil War, which the Confederates ultimately lost in 1865.",
      "By restoring the old names with soldiers or figures who were not Confederates, \u201cthey are trying to be slick,\" Morial said.",
      "For example, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, which was changed to Fort Liberty by the Biden administration, was the first to have its original name restored, in June. The Army found another American service member with the same last name, a World War II soldier. Hegseth signed an order restoring the name in February.",
      "\u201cBy instead invoking the name of World War II soldier Private Roland Bragg, Secretary Hegseth has not violated the letter of the law, but he has violated its spirit,\u201d Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., wrote in a statement opposing the defense secretary\u2019s \u201ccynical maneuver.\u201d",
      "In March, Hegseth reversed the 2023 decision changing Fort Benning in Georgia to Fort Moore.",
      "The same name restoring process applied to the additional seven bases: Fort A.P. Hill, Fort Pickett and Fort Robert E. Lee in Virginia, Fort Gordon in Georgia, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Polk in Louisiana and Fort Rucker in Alabama.",
      "Last week, Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced that he was restoring the name of the state\u2019s largest National Guard training site.",
      "In a social media post announcing the name, Landry wrote that in Louisiana, \u201cwe honor courage, not cancel it.\u201d Attached was what seemed to be an AI-generated image of a headstone with the word \u201cWokeism\u201d on it.",

      "Vehicles and electronics may be South Korea's top exports to the U.S. by value, but the country shipped more skin care and cosmetics to the U.S. than any other last year, according to data from market research company Euromonitor. France, with storied beauty brands like L'Oreal and Chanel, was second, Euromonitor said.",
      "Statistics compiled by the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency, show the U.S. imported $1.7 billion worth of South Korean cosmetics in 2024, a 54% increase from a year earlier.",
      "\u201cKorean beauty products not only add a lot of variety and choice for Americans, they really embraced them because they were offering something different for American consumers,\u201d Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.",
      "Along with media offerings such as \u201cParasite\u201d and \u201cSquid Games,\u201d and the popularity of K-pop bands like BTS, K-beauty has helped boost South Korea\u2019s profile globally, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all part and parcel really of the same thing,\u201d Lovely said. \u201cAnd it can\u2019t be completely stopped by a 25% tariff, but it\u2019s hard to see how it won\u2019t influence how much is sold in the U.S. And I think what we\u2019re hearing from producers is that it also really decreases the number of products they want to offer in this market.\u201d",
      "Senti Senti, a retailer that sells international beauty products at two New York boutiques and through an e-commerce site, saw a bit of \u201cpanic buying\u201d by customers when Trump first imposed punitive tariffs on goods from specific countries, manager Winnie Zhong said.",

      "Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia subsequently reached agreements with the Trump administration that lowered the tariff rates their exported goods faced \u2014 in Japan's case, from 25% to 15% \u2014 still higher than the current baseline of 10% tariff.",
      "But South Korea has yet to clinch an agreement, despite having a free trade agreement since 2012 that allowed cosmetics and most other consumer goods to enter the U.S. tax-free.",
      "Since the first store owned by Senti Senti opened 16 years ago, beauty products from Japan and South Korea became more of a focus and now account for 90% the stock. The business hasn't had to pass on any tariff-related costs to customers yet, but that won\u2019t be possible if the products are subject to a 25% import tax, Zhong said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not really sure where the direction of K-beauty will go to with the tariffs in place, because one of the things with K-beauty or Asian beauty is that it\u2019s supposed to be accessible pricing,\u201d she said.",

      "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally",
      "BOSTON -- A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally, issuing the third court ruling blocking the birthright order nationwide since a key Supreme Court decision in June.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin, joining another district court as well as an appellate panel of judges, found that a nationwide injunction granted to more than a dozen states remains in force under an exception to the Supreme Court ruling. That decision restricted the power of lower-court judges to issue nationwide injunctions.",
      "The states have argued Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship order is blatantly unconstitutional and threatens millions of dollars for health insurance services that are contingent on citizenship status. The issue is expected to move quickly back to the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, who helped lead the lawsuit before Sorokin, said in a statement he was \u201cthrilled the district court again barred President Trump\u2019s flagrantly unconstitutional birthright citizenship order from taking effect anywhere.\u201d",
      "\"American-born babies are American, just as they have been at every other time in our Nation\u2019s history,\u201d he added. \"The President cannot change that legal rule with the stroke of a pen.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the government had argued Sorokin should narrow the reach of his earlier ruling granting a preliminary injunction, saying it should be \u201ctailored to the States\u2019 purported financial injuries.\u201d",
      "Sorokin said a patchwork approach to the birthright order would not protect the states in part because a substantial number of people move between states. He also blasted the Trump administration, saying it had failed to explain how a narrower injunction would work.",
      "\u201cThat is, they have never addressed what renders a proposal feasible or workable, how the defendant agencies might implement it without imposing material administrative or financial burdens on the plaintiffs, or how it squares with other relevant federal statutes,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cIn fact, they have characterized such questions as irrelevant to the task the Court is now undertaking. The defendants\u2019 position in this regard defies both law and logic.\u201d",
      "Sorokin acknowledged his order would not be the last word on birthright citizenship. Trump and his administration \u201care entitled to pursue their interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and no doubt the Supreme Court will ultimately settle the question,\u201d Sorokin wrote. \u201cBut in the meantime, for purposes of this lawsuit at this juncture, the Executive Order is unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "The administration has not yet appealed any of the recent court rulings. Trump\u2019s efforts to deny citizenship to children born to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily will remain blocked unless and until the Supreme Court says otherwise.",

The Supreme Court did not decide whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.",
      "Plaintiffs in the Boston case earlier argued that the principle of birthright citizenship is \u201censhrined in the Constitution,\u201d and that Trump does not have the authority to issue the order, which they called a \u201cflagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage.\u201d",

      "The petroglyphs are easy to spot during low tide when gentle waves ebb and flow over slippery, neon-green algae growing on a stretch of sandstone. This is the first time the entire panel of petroglyphs are visible since they were first spotted nine years ago by two guests staying at a bayside U.S. Army recreation center in Waianae, about an hour\u2019s drive from Honolulu.",
      "Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner Glen Kila, who traces his lineage to the aboriginal families of this coastal Hawaii community, said he believes the resurfacing of the traditional marvels are his ancestors sending a message.",
      "\u201cIt's telling the community that the ocean is rising,\u201d said Kila, a recognized expert on the local culture and history of Waianae who is consulting with the Army on the protection of the petroglyphs.",
      "Army officials are trying to balance protecting the petroglyphs with their accessibility on a public beach.",
      "John and Sandy Stone consulted tide charts and drove about 30 minutes from their home early Tuesday to get a glimpse after a watching a local TV report about the petroglyphs.",
      "\u201cIt was so interesting to touch them,\u201d said John Stone, who splits his time between Hawaii and California. \u201cIt felt interesting to kind of have a connection with the past like that.\u201d",
      "It is difficult to date petroglyphs, but an archaeological site in the area is from about 600 years ago, said Laura Gilda, an archaeologist with U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii. According to Kila, Hawaiians arrived in Waianae at least 1,000 years ago.",
      "The beach here fluctuates in size and profile each year, with low-pressure weather systems that form in the eastern Pacific between May and November causing waves that cut away loose sand from shorelines and redeposit them further out, according to an Army report on the petroglyphs. That shift is likely what causes their temporary exposure.",
      "Archaeologists identified a total of 26 petroglyphs. Of the 18 anthropomorphic stick figures, eight are depicted with possible male genitalia and the remainder are of undetermined gender, the report said.",
      "The entire panel stretches about 115 feet (35 meters) long, Gilda said.",
      "When the petroglyphs first reemerged in July 2016, it was after late spring and early summer storms, including hurricanes, with a lot of wave action that swept the sand away, Gilda said.",

      "Based on the teachings Kila learned, the lineal petroglyphs appear to be telling a religious, ceremonial story. He interprets the largest figure, which appears to include hands and fingers with one arm raised and the other down, to represent the rising and setting sun.",
      "Kila said that when the military in the 1930s took over the area and evicted Native Hawaiians, including his family who lived there for generations, his great-great grandmother refused to leave so his family exchanged mountain lands with a coffee plantation so she could remain near the bay.",
      "In an interview included in the Army's report, he recalled growing up in Waianae without television. So \"the ocean and mountains were our playground,\u201d he said. The Army recreation center was off-limits to the pubic, and the seawall was the barrier between Native Hawaiians and the military, Kila said.",
      "Kila, now 72, recalled that if they walked on top of the wall, they were clubbed and pushed off by military police.",
      "\u201cWe were proud and knew where we came from, so we never fostered any hatred for the military because one day we believed that the land will eventually return to us,\u201d he said.",
      "Kila, while visiting the petroglyphs earlier this week, told The Associated Press that the Army's protection of them represents a shift in that community relationship.",
      "Officials have been grappling with how to share the petroglyphs with the community while also protecting them, Gilda said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The House Ethics Committee on Friday told Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to make additional payments for her attendance at the 2021 Met Fashion Gala, where she drew attention for wearing a dress adorned with the message \u201ctax the rich.\"",
      "The ethics panel, which found the New York Democrat had underpaid for some of the services and clothing for the event, also issued reports Friday on unrelated ethics allegations against Reps. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick or Florida and Henry Cuellar of Texas.",
      "In a 31-page report on the allegations against Ocasio-Cortez, the Ethics Committee said she had tried to comply with House rules on accepting gifts but failed by \u201cimpermissibly accepting a gift of free admission to the 2021 Met Gala for her partner and by failing to pay full fair market value for some of the items worn to the event.\u201d",
      "As a guest of Vogue, Ocasio-Cortez and her partner received tickets to the gala valued at $35,000, as well as customized clothing, hair and makeup styling and a hotel room to prepare for the high-society event.",
      "The congresswoman worked with an attorney to comply with House ethics rules and paid for most of the goods and services with personal funds, but the ethics panel found \"the payments were significantly delayed and some payments fell short of fair market value.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, Mike Casca, said: \u201cThe Congresswoman appreciates the Committee finding that she made efforts to ensure her compliance with House Rules and sought to act consistently with her ethical requirements as a Member of the House. She accepts the ruling and will remedy the remaining amounts, as she\u2019s done at each step in this process.\u201d",
      "The House Ethics Committee issued a formal reproval Friday of Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., following a yearslong investigation into an insider-trading allegation over his wife\u2019s purchase of stock in a steel company in his Butler-area congressional district.",
      "The panel also said Kelly and his wife, Victoria Kelly, should divest of any stock in the company, Cleveland-Cliffs, before the congressman takes any further official actions related to it.",
      "While the committee said it \u201cdid not find evidence\u201d that Kelly \u201cknowingly or intentionally caused his spouse to trade based on insider information,\u201d its report also said it \u201cdid not receive full cooperation from Mrs. Kelly and was therefore unable to determine whether her stock purchase was improper.\u201d",
      "However, the report said, \u201cRepresentative Kelly\u2019s failure to acknowledge the seriousness of the alleged misconduct\u201d and of the investigation itself was a violation of the code of official conduct. The committee did \u201cnot find a clear violation\u201d of conflict of interest.",
      "The congressman said in a statement Friday, \u201cMy family and I look forward to putting this distraction behind us.\"",
      "Kelly noted the investigation has \u201cunnecessarily\u201d lasted for nearly five years, and in the time since the Cleveland Cliffs Butler Works plant faced an uncertain future.",

      "Lori Vallow Daybell's two Arizona murder conspiracy trials were marked by tensions between her and the judge",
      "PHOENIX -- Moments before the Idaho mother with doomsday beliefs was given two more life sentences in prison, she complained about jail conditions and the legal system, saying the rules of evidence do not allow two sides of the story.",
      "Judge Justin Beresky abruptly interrupted, saying: \u201cActually, they do.\u201d",
      "It was a moment that further highlighted the tension between Lori Vallow Daybell, who represented herself in two murder conspiracy cases in Arizona, and Beresky, who pulled no punches when the time came for him to address the court.",
      "Beresky said Vallow Daybell was not truthful when she claimed she was prevented from telling her side of the story and was unable to get a fair trial. The media attention she craved, he said, will fade into obscurity now that her trials are over.",
      "\u201cThe amount of contemplation, calculation, planning and manipulation that went into these crimes is unparalleled in my career,\u201d said Beresky, who has been a Maricopa County Superior Court judge since 2017 and has presided over other high-profile cases.",
      "Friday\u2019s sentencing ended the legal saga of Vallow Daybell, 51, who will likely spend no time in an Arizona prison because she already was serving three life sentences in Idaho for killing her two youngest children and conspiring to kill a romantic rival.",
      "In Arizona she was convicted of conspiring to kill her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, and her niece\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. Charles Vallow was fatally shot, while Boudreaux survived.",
      "Vallow Daybell maintained that she did nothing wrong and said the string of deaths were simply tragedies.",
      "She turned to her own religious beliefs in saying she believes she is among servants who Jesus is sending into prison to become warriors and who, ultimately, will be released to serve him.",
      "Beresky implied that she got the meaning wrong when she referenced a verse about prisoners going free.",
      "\u201cThat is a verse about people that accept Jesus can be in prison and they will go free when they die and go to heaven, but it will take an act of God for you to go free,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIn short, you should never be released from prison.\u201d",
      "Vallow Daybell's trials in Phoenix were infused with her religious beliefs, including that people in her life were possessed by evil spirits. She routinely sparred with Beresky, occasionally leaning over to consult with her advisory counsel.",

      "Mel McDonald, a retired Maricopa County judge who was not involved in the trials but watched them, said Beresky did an exceptional job of maintaining courtroom decorum and demonstrated extraordinary patience despite obstructive tactics from Vallow Daybell.",
      "\u201cHe gives her latitude,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cBut he doesn't let her run wild.\u201d",
      "Last month, during the trial over the conspiracy to kill Boudreaux, Vallow Daybell falsely accused Beresky of yelling at her after he explained that her efforts to introduce favorable evidence about her character could open the door to jurors hearing about her convictions in Idaho and for Vallow's death.",
      "\u201cYou don't need to talk to me that way,\" Vallow Daybell said.",
      "\u201cTake her out,\u201d Beresky told a security officer, who led her from the courtroom.",
      "In defending herself, Vallow Daybell struggled with legal matters that most lawyers consider routine, such as lining up witnesses to testify. She insisted on exercising her speedy trial rights and rejected the judge\u2019s offer for later dates, yet complained about not having enough time to prepare. She also tried to get Beresky removed from the case, arguing that he was biased against her.",
      "In another moment emblematic of the tensions between judge and defendant, Beresky expressed skepticism during jury selection for her second Arizona trial when she claimed she was too sick to move forward. The proceedings were postponed for the day.",
      "But the trial continued, with Beresky later saying there was no objective evidence to support her claims.",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:53:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

    "story": [
      "She may be Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, but you're just as likely to find her living in Paris as you might in London. \"My blood is English, but my culture is French,\" she said.",
      "There is a duality about her. She can be as heartwarming in English (\"Darkest Hour\") as she can be heartwrenching in French (\"I've Loved You So Long\"). Many of her foreign films have been showcased at the Cine Lumiere, a French art house in London. \"A little slice of Paris,\" she said.",
      "It's convenient, now that she's back in London, playing the deputy director of MI5 in the Apple TV+ series \"Slow Horses.\"",
      "A chilly, stiff upper-lip has often been a calling card for Thomas \u2013 too stiff, she admits, early on: \"I think it was Sydney Pollock \u2013 or it might have been Robert Redford, take your pick,\" she laughed. \"One of them said to me, 'You know, you have to be generous. Forget what you're trying to defend. Forget trying to hide. Be more generous.' And I'm not sure I really understood what he meant by that. He just planted a seed, and then I was able to kind of unzip a bit more.\"",
      "And she about to unzip even more, creatively digging into something intensely personal in her past. She said, \"When I was five, my father was killed, and my mother remarried. And tragically, he was killed five years later. And I know that a lot of the time when I was a younger woman, I had this feeling of something missing, this piece of my puzzle missing having grown up with only one parent.\"",
      "Both had been pilots in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm; both were lost in remarkably similar training accidents; and both left a hole that had her climbing out into her imagination. When she was a little girl she wrote and illustrated stories: \"A mommy and a daddy and two children, just doing ordinary things, like going away on holiday and things like that\" \u2013 a family experience she never knew.",
      "The memories of her dad were incomplete, fuzzy, like sketches she played out in her head. But those images became the seeds for what grew into a screenplay, and then came to life as the first movie she's ever directed: \"My Mother's Wedding.\"",
      "It garnered an all-star cast: Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham play Thomas' daughters who are each struggling in different ways  with the loss of a father or stepfather, just as their mother prepares to marry again.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"My Mother's Wedding\" click on the video player below:",
      "Thomas has already done movie weddings, of course, as in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" Early on, she had a sarcastic confidence about her. She didn't have the most lines in that 1994 film, but in brevity she was brilliant:",
      "That demeanor might have been a surprise to those who knew her when she was bouncing around Royal Naval bases, a bit of a wallflower as a child, even into adulthood. \"I was excruciatingly shy,\" she said. \"I don't know when it changed, to be honest.\"",
      "She's hardly shy anymore, if her character in \"Fleabag\" is any indication. Perhaps it's fitting she was discovered by another admittedly shy success story, Prince. You'd think that would make her a pretty cool mom (she has three children with her first husband), but it turns out \u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I hadn't watched it with them, but as I was leaving my teenage children alone one evening, and they were having pizza and a friend 'round, I said, 'Watch \"Under the Cherry Moon,\" it's on the telly! Come on, it'll be fun!' And when I got back, they weren't actually very polite about it.\"",
      "She has more than made up for it, later starring opposite Robert Redford (\"The Horse Whisperer\"), Harrison Ford (\"Random Hearts\"), and Tom Cruise (\"Mission: Impossible\").",
      "\"I'm so proud to be in 'Mission: Impossible,' I cannot even get over it!\" she said. \"I'm in this thing, which is this enormous monster, and you know, these kids, they have no idea about 'Gosford Park.' They have no idea about 'Four Weddings,' but they've all seen 'Mission: Impossible'! And they have no idea I speak French or do all these other kind of slightly murkier films in France, you know?\"",
      "And then, of course, there was \"The English Patient,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination for best actress. \"It's quite moving actually, when you see yourself at sort of 30 acting your socks off,\" she said.",
      "Another place she acted her socks off is at the Royal Court Theatre, where she won an Olivier Award for her performance in \"The Seagull,\" a role she later took to Broadway. \"New York audiences, when they are enjoying themselves, I mean it's electric \u2013 you can really, really feel it,\" she said.",
      "And London audiences? \"We are much more kind of passive, perhaps. Reserved. Of course we are!\" she laughed.",
      "But even while talking at the Royal Court, she found herself thinking about her film. As intimate as the stage may be, for her, \"My Mother's Wedding\" is more so. \"I love working on stage, as you can probably tell. I really, really love it. But the joy and satisfaction and exhaustion that comes from filmmaking when you are being a director, that is not far off. Pretty good. It's just extraordinary.\"",
      "At 65, and now a grandmother, she's working as hard as ever, not taking a lot of time to smell the roses per se, but she'll surely stop for someone who has a kind word or two: \"A lady came up to me the other day and said, 'I know you hate this, but I just wanted to say...' \u00a0and I said, 'I don't hate this at all!

    "summary": "It took the art world decades to recognize Louise Nevelson, whose monochromatic and immersive sculptures, often incorporating found objects, verged on the monumental.",
    "story": [
      "Louise Nevelson's artwork looks right at home at the Whitney Museum of American Art, mingling with the skyscrapers of Manhattan. She found inspiration in the city as early as the 1920s, yet it would take the art world decades to recognize her and her iconic sculptures.",
      "\"She was given her first respective at the Whitney in 1967,\" said Maria Nevelson, the artist's granddaughter, who runs the Louise Nevelson Foundation. \"I was seven years old. And there was a line of people all the way around the block, up to the front door. I really did get chills. It was the first time I responded to artwork in general, and to my grandmother's artwork.\"",
      "Nearly six decades later, the Whitney is holding a new Nevelson exhibition, which is open until August 10.",
      "Asked what Louise was like as a grandmother, Maria laughed: \"Oh, she was intimidating and unconventional. What comes to mind first is her atmospheric dressing. Anything could have been pulled into this assemblage and this layering of rich brocades and silks.\"",
      "That fancy wardrobe didn't stop Nevelson from getting her hands dirty: \"She'd dumpster dive, she'd get into the garbage can, she'd pull out filthy pieces of wood, and we'd have to take 'em home,\" said Maria. \"I would say the streets of New York weren't paved with gold for her; it was paved with garbage. And she loved it!\"",
      "Nevelson's attraction to wood may have grown from her family tree \u2013 her family owned lumber yards in present-day Ukraine, where she was born in 1899. Louise was a young girl who spoke no English when her father decided to move the family to Rockland, Maine.",
      "\"It was a bustling seaport town,\" said Maria. \"They got off the train and, she said, rednecks threw mud at them. And she said, 'I knew I was a Jew, I knew I was different.' She was about five, six years old then. That's her greeting to America.\"",
      "Undaunted, Nevelson learned English, and at age nine, announced she was going to be a sculptor.",
      "\"She knew always what she wanted to be and do, and she pursued it fiercely,\" said Brooke Minto, executive director and CEO of the Columbus Museum of Art, where Nevelson's work is also currently on display. \"It was a decade's long journey, and she just kept at it.\"",
      "Nevelson would choose a monochromatic palette to unify her materials.

    "summary": "In the late 1940s, the work of the House Un-American Activities Committee eventually led to a Hollywood blacklist, now the focus of an exhibit at the New York Historical Society.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 The central question in 1947, as the House Un-American Activities Committee investigated alleged Communist influence in Hollywood, was: \"Are you a member of the Communist Party?\"",
      "Chaired by Republican Rep. John Parnell Thomas of New Jersey, the committee eventually led to a Hollywood blacklist, now the focus of a new exhibit at the New York Historical Society.",
      "\"The exhibit really tells the story of the Hollywood Ten,\" Louise Mirrer, president of the New York Historical Society, told CBS News, of a group of 10 Hollywood writers and directors. \"And the charge was for the Hollywood Ten, that they were making movies that espoused the Communist point of view.\"",
      "The Hollywood Ten refused to answer the committee's questions. They were held in contempt of Congress, each sentenced from anywhere between six months to a year in prison, and blacklisted by studio executives.",
      "\"I think it had an enormous effect,\" Anne Lessy, assistant curator of history exhibitions for the historical society, told CBS News of the impact of the blacklist. \"If you wanted to be a part of the film industry, you essentially forfeited your privacy and your right to your own political ideas and affiliations.\"",
      "Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, one of the Hollywood Ten, spent 10 months in prison. His daughter, Mitzi, was 5 years old at the time. Her drawings and letters to him are on display in the exhibit, as well as testimony from those who named suspected Communists.",
      "\"In an effort to save themselves, their careers and their reputations, many, you know, creatives felt compelled to name names, which is what the committee wanted,\" Lessy said.",
      "Even Walt Disney famously testified before the committee.",
      "\"Walt Disney very much objected to labor organizing that had taken place in his studios and blamed it on Communist infiltration,\" Lessy said. \"And then you also have Ronald Reagan, who at the time, was president of the Screen Actors Guild. While he didn't name names in public, he did to the committee's investigator. And he went on to very much endorse the anti-Communist crusade.\"",
      "The blacklist later expanded to include classically trained pianist Hazel Scott, the first Black entertainer to have a nationally syndicated TV show. But the show was canceled after she was named in an anti-Communist pamphlet.",
      "Once out of prison, Trumbo used pseudonyms to write the Academy Award-winning films \"The Brave One\" and \"Roman Holiday.\"",
      "\"So it took about four decades...for the Academy Awards to finally recognize Dalton Trumbo,\" Lessy said. \"And...that was seen as the beginning of eroding of the committee's power.\"",
      "The impact of the Red Scare also extended beyond Hollywood.",
      "\"A number of regular Americans got caught up in this anti-Communist fervor, members of labor unions, high school teachers,\" Lessy said. \"College professors also came under scrutiny. There was a well-known publication called Red Channels that would provide very detailed information on a wide range of creatives. And so even just your name appearing in one of these publications was enough to get you blacklisted.\"",
      "By the 1960s, as the Red Scare had faded, so too did the blacklist's power. And in 1975, the House Un-American Activities Committee was abolished.",
      "\"I think it [the Hollywood blacklist] raises important questions about how to protect a robust democracy,\" Lessy said. \"How do we protect our rights and freedoms, particularly freedom of speech...If you hold unpopular views, should you be punished? Should you lose your job? These are all questions we should be wrestling with.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Skydance has made written commitments to ensuring that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum and that CBS's reporting will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based,\" Carr said in the statement.",
      "Carr also noted the company's commitment to local news coverage and said Skydance \"will work closely with its affiliated broadcast stations to ensure a productive partnership that will strengthen its affiliates' ability to serve their local communities.\"",
      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "The companies said in a statement Friday that the transaction is expected to close on Aug. 7.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",
      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",
      "\"It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America,\" Gomez said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bridget-everett-on-how-she-ended-up-as-somebody-somewhere/",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:18:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The actress and cabaret star put her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, on the map with the award-winning HBO series about a Midwestern woman returning home and working through grief. She returned to Manhattan, to talk about her surreal journey.",
    "story": [
      "Bridget Everett will try to tell you she's not a celebrity in Manhattan, Kansas, but don't believe her. She did grow up here, one of six kids, so there's that. \"I just love that it still feels like small-town America,\" she said. \"I come back quite a bit and I visit the same spots.\"",
      "But it was when her HBO show \"Somebody Somewhere\" was set here in Manhattan, that Everett became a bon fide local legend.",
      "The show follows Sam Miller (played by Everett), who moves back to her hometown in her 40s, trying to figure out herself, and life, after the death of her sister. Everett was a writer, producer, and lead actor in the semi-autobiographical series. \"I was like, 'Is anybody going to watch this? This is not a cool show!'\" she said. \"You know, like, it's about friendship. I'm not a top model, you know? I don't want to speak for anybody else in the cast! But I think that's exactly kind of why it works.\"",
      "Unlike her character on the show, who returns home to Manhattan, Kansas, Everett stayed in Manhattan, New York, for years, working mostly as a waitress and using, believe or not, karaoke as her main creative outlet.",
      "\"My way of connecting with people is through singing,\" she said. \"It kind of always has been, and it's easier for me to unlock and kind of be who I really want to be when I'm singing.",
      "Those karaoke performances led to her own, now-legendary cabaret shows at the famed Joe's Pub in New York. Everett's performances are sort of unlike anything you've seen, and so risqu\u00e9 we can't show you much of it here on \"Sunday Morning.\"",
      "Everett said, \"What's interesting to me is, like, learning about people, and why am I up there with no bra and a low-cut thing with everything flying around? It's part of who I am, and I also kind of do it to understand myself, honestly. I like to talk about my family in this way because my family and I don't talk about it. I don't see a mental health care professional!\"",
      "And that's the amazing part: Everett's cabaret shows somehow end up being, in part anyway, a meditation on life and grief, including saying goodbye to her father, as well as the loss of her mother, sister, and her beloved dog, Poppy, whom she called the love of her life. \"For a while I felt a little bit of shame saying that, because romantic love is kind of what most people aspire to,\" Everett said. \"My life is driven in a different way. She just taught me how to love, and she just cracked my heart open in a way that, like, no other person could.\"",
      "In fact, it was this side of Everett that HBO and the show's creators wanted to highlight \u2013 the way we can feel both strong and broken, hopeless and hopeful, all in the same moment.",
      "Everett, who writes and performs multiple original songs on the show, says she got her love of music from her mother, Freddie. She also got her sense of humor from her mom, as well as her siblings, including Brock, Brian and Brad, who had given Bridget a piece of feedback: that her acting was improving. \"I was being honest,\" Brad said. \"Her acting, especially towards the end, I thought, was authentic. I even teared up on some of that, which is difficult to do when you know your sibling [is] acting. So, you need to separate who you know, and then see her in a character. And have it move you? I think it's a great compliment to her.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Bridget. \"You could have just said that in a text.\"",
      "The HBO show features a number of Everett's actual friends and collaborators from New York, including Murray Hill, Mary Catherine Garrison, and, in a star turn, the just Emmy-nominated Jeff Hiller as her best friend, Joel.",
      "Though HBO chose not to renew \"Somebody Somewhere\" for a fourth season, it did win a prestigious Peabody Award, and also picked up an Emmy nomination this season for writing for a comedy series.",
      "Everett says the whole thing feels a little surreal: the journey from being somebody somewhere, to somebody who is right where she's supposed to be.",
      "\"Nothing will ever match this, and it couldn't, but that's okay,\" she said. \"A lot of people don't get the opportunity to have a TV show, to live a life beyond their wildest dreams. And then to get to do it with the people I love? It's why it's taken so long for me to move on and kind of let go. But now I'm just trying to celebrate that I got to do it at all.\"",

      "\"The nature of the call was for a cardiac arrest,\" the Clearwater Police Department said in a statement. He was taken to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.",
      "\"There were no signs of foul play or suspicious activity,\" Maj. Nate Burnside told reporters.",
      "Hogan was perhaps the biggest star in WWE's long history. He was the main draw for the first WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon.",
      "He won at least six WWE championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.",
      "\"One of pop culture's most recognizable figures, Hogan helped WWE achieve global recognition in the 1980s. WWE extends its condolences to Hogan's family, friends, and fans,\" WWE said in\u00a0a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"Hulkamania,\" as the energy he created was called, started running wild in the mid-1980s and pushed professional wrestling into the mainstream. He was a flag-waving American hero with the horseshoe mustache, red and yellow gear and massive arms he called his \"24-inch pythons.\"",

      "\"The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,\" Hogan said. \"People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.\"",
      "Hogan first became champion in what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, and pro wrestling took off from there. His popularity helped lead to the creation of the annual WrestleMania event in 1985, when he teamed up with Mr. T to beat \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the main event.",
      "He slammed and beat Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III in 1987, and the WWF gained momentum. His feud with the late \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage \u2014 perhaps his greatest rival \u2014 carried pro wrestling even further.",
      "Hogan was a central figure in what is known as the Monday Night Wars. The WWE and World Championship Wrestling were battling for ratings supremacy in 1996. Hogan tilted things in WCW's favor with the birth of the Hollywood Hogan character and the formation of the New World Order, a villainous stable that put WCW ahead in the ratings.",
      "He returned to the WWE in 2002 and became a champion again. His match with The Rock at WrestleMania X8, a loss during which fans cheered for his \"bad guy\" character, was seen as a passing of the torch.",
      "Hogan was perhaps as well known for his larger-than-life personality as he was his in-ring exploits. He was beloved for his \"promos\" \u2014 hype sessions he used to draw fans into matches.

      "The former Fleetwood Mac bandmates shared a pair of cryptic messages across their Instagram accounts last week which combined to read, \"And if you go forward\u2026 I'll meet you there\" \u2014 lyrics from \"Frozen Love,\" a song off the duo's fabled 1973 album. Social media lit up with discussion of a possible reunion, seven years after Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac.",
      "On Wednesday, Nicks and Buckingham jointly posted a video of a billboard advertising the album's reissue going up in Los Angeles, announcing in the post's caption that the first single from the release, a newly remastered edition of \"Crying In The Night,\" was available now to stream.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham released \"Buckingham Nicks\" shortly before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1974. It was a commercial failure, resulting in their label, Polydor Records, dropping the pair from their contract. The album's last official release was a 1981 vinyl pressing from Polydor, according to Discogs, but the record has never been available on CD or digital, although bootlegs have surfaced over the years.",
      "Now, premium vinyl record producer Rhino High Fidelity is gearing up to release the full album on Sept. 19, alongside fresh liner notes from music journalist David Fricke, including interviews with both Buckingham and Nicks.",
      "\"[We] knew what we had as a duo, two songwriters that sang really well together. And it was a very natural thing, from the beginning.\" Nicks is quoted as saying in a Rhino press release. Buckingham said the album \"stands up in a way you hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work.\"",
      "The remastered album is now available to pre-order in a standard edition and a deluxe edition, which includes two 7-inch singles, \"Crying In The Night\" and \"Don't Let Me Down Again.\" The standard edition is limited to 5,000 copies, while the singles are numbered to 2,000.",
      "Rumors of a possible \"Buckingham Nicks\" reissue have percolated for years. Back in 2011, Buckingham told Rolling Stone that the album has \"been a victim of inertia. It's funny, I spent a lot of time with Stevie this year when she was finishing her album and we were getting along great. We have every intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can't put any specifics on that.\"",
      "Rhino sourced the audio for the remastered vinyl from the duo's original analog master tapes of the album, which was recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, not far from the billboard announcing its long-awaited return.",

      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",

      "After meeting for just over one hour with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Mr. Trump emerged to say, \"We have good news. We've reached a deal.\"",

      "President Trump's meeting Starmer was also expected to touch on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed a framework trade deal\u00a0last month.

      "Mr. Trump didn't specify how much he would reduce the timeline, but said he was \"very disappointed\" in Putin for continuing to attack Ukraine. Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",
      "There's was good news for U.S. companies that sell products into the EU market, too, as Mr. Trump announced that all 27 EU nations \"will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff.\"",
      "The agreement was made at Trump's luxury golf resort in Turnberry, on the Scottish coast, where the president spent the weekend teeing off.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Skydance has made written commitments to ensuring that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum and that CBS's reporting will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based,\" Carr said in the statement.",
      "Carr also noted the company's commitment to local news coverage and said Skydance \"will work closely with its affiliated broadcast stations to ensure a productive partnership that will strengthen its affiliates' ability to serve their local communities.\"",
      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "The companies said in a statement Friday that the transaction is expected to close on Aug. 7.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",
      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",
      "\"It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America,\" Gomez said.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Trump administration setting 15% as a floor for tariffs, companies and economists are warning of higher prices later this year.",
    "story": [
      "The new normal for U.S. tariffs on foreign goods starts at 15%. Even as President Trump seeks to forge new terms of trade\u00a0with Japan, the European Union and other global economic partners, he is raising the floor for tariffs to their highest level in decades.",
      "Speaking\u00a0at an AI summit on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,\" conditioning the lower rate on countries opening their economies to the U.S.",
      "The White House has said sharply higher tariffs could take effect on dozens of countries as soon as Aug. 1 unless they ink new trade deals. The Trump administration has a separate negotiating timeline with China, which faces an Aug. 12 deadline for an agreement.",
      "As these new rules of international commerce take shape, companies across a range of industries are emphasizing that higher tariffs translate into higher operational costs \u2014 and higher prices for consumers.",
      "For example, Nestl\u00e9 on Thursday said it was considering hiking prices for candy bars and other products as tariffs threaten to eat into the food company's profit margins. The same day, Italian fashion brand Moncler said it has already hiked prices for its apparel to offset additional tariff-related costs. And General Electric said this week that proposed U.S. tariffs, should they take effect, would cost the company around $500 million in 2025, noting that it would move to offset those taxes through \"cost controls and pricing actions.\"",
      "Orange juice importer Johanna Foods has gone a step further, this week filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its proposed\u00a050% tariff on Brazil, which the New Jersey company said would seriously hurt its business and force it to hike product prices by up to 25%.",
      "The White House disputes that higher U.S. tariffs will drive up costs for businesses and consumers.",
      "\"The administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be borne by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Desai also pointed to a recent analysis by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that he said shows import prices falling this year.",
      "Price hikes not \"instantaneous\"",
      "Economists warn that consumers should brace for higher prices on a range of goods, from leather products and clothing to electronics and automobiles, later this year.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note. \"Now that the Trump administration is concluding deals that would see the tariff rate facing most trading partners settling at between 15% and 20%, with even higher rates levied on Chinese imports, we suspect retailers will be forced to finally raise the prices paid by consumers.\"",
      "Inflation in the early part of 2025 remained fairly contained. That's because many companies and consumers accelerated their purchases of imported goods to avoid the risk of paying more if, or when, steep new tariffs take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, in the short-term, sharply higher prices are unlikely across the board, according to trade experts.",
      "\"When you open up the hood of that, it's not going to be even across all categories of spending,\" Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's categories of spending where we import more that are going to be more sensitive to tariffs.\"",
      "But over the longer term, an increased baseline tariff, coupled wtih higher levies on individual countries, is projected to drive up U.S. prices by 2% over the next two years, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"This isn't an instantaneous, 'We wake up the next morning and the world is different,'\" Tedeschi added.",
      "But as the new U.S. tariff regime becomes embedded in global supply chains, some import-heavy product categories could see especially sharp price increases, he said. Specifically, foreign-made leather shoes and handbags, along with apparel, could see prices spike by at least 40%, while the cost of electronics could jump more than 20%, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "Federal debt, which currently stands at more than $36 trillion, is projected to rise due to the new tax cuts and spending bill signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, according to forecasts from economists and public policy think tanks. The nation's deficit could rise by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years because of the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0said, citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the rebate could be \"for people of a certain income level,\" although he didn't specify the threshold that he's considering.",
      "The federal government has collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue since the Trump administration instituted its higher import duties earlier this year, which could increase to $300 billion per year, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' \"Mornings with Maria\" on Tuesday.",
      "Tariffs vary from country to country, but they're paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, or manufacturers that import materials and components from other countries, like Ford Motor. So far, some companies have been\u00a0swallowing the higher costs\u00a0rather than passing them on to consumers, although the\u00a0latest inflation report\u00a0signaled that higher tariff rates may be edging into consumer prices.",
      "Rebate checks have been floated by Mr. Trump previously, with the president saying in February he was considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. During the pandemic, taxpayers received three rebate checks \u2014 two under the first Trump administration, and the third under the Biden administration \u2014 aimed at offsetting the economic impact of the crisis.",
      "Typically, such rebates are issued through the tax code, which would require Congress to pass new tax legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to issue checks.",
      "Lawmakers earlier this month passed a massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, which authorizes some new tax breaks, but doesn't include a rebate based on tariffs.",
      "Some of the bill's new tax cuts are limited to low- and middle-income taxpayers. For instance, its new $6,000 deduction for senior citizens phases out for single taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 and married filers with earnings over $150,000.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in grants to schools for adult literacy, English language instruction and other programs, the Education Department said Friday.",
      "President Trump's administration had withheld more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House's priorities.",
      "The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, members of Congress from both parties and others called for the administration to release money schools rely on for a wide range of programs. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Mr. Trump.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed the release of the funds, and said \"[g]uardrails are in place to ensure these funds will not be used in violation of Executive Orders or administration policy.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and the money would be begin to be dispersed next week.",
      "Last week, the department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.",
      "The release of that money came days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. Those senators had also called for the rest of the money to be distributed, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was among the lawmakers calling for the release of the grants.",
      "\"The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,\" she said. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills, contributing to local economies.",
      "In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a \"radical leftwing agenda. \"",
      "\"We share your concern,\" the GOP senators had written. \"However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.\"",
      "School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money.",
      "In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district's annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.",
      "The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.",
      "On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.",
      "Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects.",

      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",
      "Fed staff also pointed to the complication of historic renovations \u2014 both buildings have significant preservation needs. Constructing a new building on an empty site would have been cheaper.",

    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",

It's expected to include a mix of both personal time and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",
      "During his visit, he's also set to meet Scotland's top official, First Minister John Swinney, who publicly backed Kamala Harris' presidential bid against Mr. Trump last year.",

      "But despite his ancestry, Mr. Trump can likely expect a lukewarm to cold reception on Scottish soil. Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the policies he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",

But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",
      "Mr. Trump will return to the U.K. for an unprecedented second official state visit on September 17, during which he is scheduled to meet with King Charles III.

    "summary": "This week's U.S. trade agreement with Japan could provide a framework for a pact with the European Union, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

      "She issued a statement under the headline: \"Make Agriculture Great Again Trade Wins.\"",
      "\"American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years,\" Rollins said. \"Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines.

      "Australia has allowed imports of beef grown in the U.S. since 2019, but not allowed imports from the U.S. of beef sourced from Canada or Mexico because of the disease risk.",
      "The U.S. has recently introduced additional movement controls that identify and trace all cattle from Mexico and Canada to their farms of origin.

      "\"Australia bans \u2014 and they're wonderful people, and wonderful everything \u2014 but they ban American beef,\" Mr. Trump told reporters then. \"Yet we imported $3 billion of Australian beef from them just last year alone. They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",
      "Opposition lawmaker David Littleproud said he suspected the government was endangering Australia's cattle industry to appease Mr. Trump.",
      "Concerns over mad cow disease in imported cattle",
      "\"I want to see the science and it should be predicated on science. I'm suspicious of the speed at which this has been done,\" Littleproud told reporters.",
      "\"We need to give confidence to the industry, but also to you (the public): this is not just about animal welfare, this is about human welfare, this is about BSE potentially coming into this country and having a human impact, so I think it's important the government's very transparent about the science and I don't think it's even beyond the question to have an independent panel review that science to give confidence to everybody,\" he added.",
      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",
      "\"The department's undertaken a technical scientific assessment and we have to put faith in them. They've made this assessment themselves. They've said: 'We've looked at this, we've looked at the best science, this is a decision that we feel comfortable with,'\" Evans said.",
      "\"When you have a $75 billion (Australian $50 billion) industry relying on them not making this mistake, I'm sure they've been very cautious in their decision-making,\" he added.",
      "But Australian demand for U.S. beef is likely to remain low despite the eased restrictions, for reasons including a relatively weak Australian dollar.",
      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",
      "Simon Quilty, an analyst with Global Agri Trends, agreed that it was unlikely Australian consumers would soon see U.S. beef in on their grocery stores shelves.",
      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",
      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

      "\"That is what we expect to learn more about during this pilot. Riders may experience longer wait times if women drivers are unavailable or further away. If so, they can choose to wait, reserve a ride with a woman driver for a later time, or choose a ride with any available driver that may not match their preference,\" an Uber spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",

      "The Hershey Company on Tuesday confirmed media reports it is raising candy prices as it battles rising cocoa costs.",
      "The price change will be a \"low double-digit increase\" and affect products across the company's confection portfolio, according to a Hershey spokesperson. Founded in 1894, the Pennsylvania-based company owns over 90\u00a0brands including Hershey Kisses, KitKat, Reese's and York.",
      "\"This change is not related to tariffs or trade policies,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"It reflects the reality of rising ingredient costs including the unprecedented cost of cocoa.\"",
      "Price increases typically take around 90 days to take effect, although the timeframe varies by retailer, the spokesperson added.",
      "Global cocoa shortage",
      "Cocoa prices have skyrocketed in recent years due to a global cocoa shortage. The cost for the commodity was $8,402 in June, a 73% increase from five years ago, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which tracks food prices.",
      "The majority of the world's cocoa supply comes from Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which have faced heatwaves and heavy rain linked to climate change. These unfavorable weather conditions have led to diseases like Black pod rot, which kills cocoa crops. Chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms is another reason behind the spike in cocoa prices,\u00a0according to an article from J.P. Morgan Global Research.",
      "\"Cocoa is a market where the grower produces a very high-value good but receives a very low share of the actual value chain. As a result, replanting rates of diseased trees are low and West African yields have been more subject to weather impacts,\" Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities strategist at J.P. Morgan, said in the article.",
      "In a May earnings call, Michele Buck, president of The Hershey Company, said the candy company would lean into products that are \"less Cocoa intensive\" as it navigates the inflation of cocoa prices. This is part of the company's vision to become a \"snacking powerhouse\" Buck said.",
      "\"We love our chocolate business and we want to continue to grow that,\" Buck said. \"But we also know that if we get into white spaces like sweets, better-for-you and salty, it adds incremental consumers and occasions,\" she added.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 18:23:57 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said he's \"thinking about\" eliminating capital gains tax on home sales. Here's what that would mean for the housing market.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday floated the possibility of eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, in a move that would change the way real estate profits are taxed for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he is weighing supporting\u00a0legislation\u00a0introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia that would nix the existing capital gains tax on home sales. Greene called the tax \"an outdated, unfair burden\u2014especially in today's housing market, where values have skyrocketed.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about that,\" Mr. Trump responded to a reporter, when asked how important it is that the capital gains tax be eliminated in order to \"unleash\" the housing market. \"It would also unleash it just by lowering the interest rates,\" the president said, adding, \"If the fed would lower the rates we wouldn't even have to do that. But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.\"",
      "Currently, single-tax filers can exclude up to $250,000 in capital gains from sales of their primary homes from their taxable incomes under what's called the Section 121\u00a0exclusion. That amount rises to $500,000 for joint filers. Both amounts have remained fixed since 1997.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said it had nothing additional to add to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "\"Homeowners who have lived in their homes for decades, especially seniors in places where values have surged, shouldn't be forced to stay put because of an IRS penalty,\" Greene said in a statement announcing the proposed No Tax on Home Sales Act. \"My bill unlocks that equity, helps fix the housing shortage, and supports long-term financial security for American families.\"",
      "According to Research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the current federal policy on the capital gains tax on home sales is \"quietly distorting the housing market\" by \"locking in older homeowners, and strangling inventory just when America needs it most.\"",
      "\"Stay-put penalty\"",
      "A NAR study found that 34% of homeowners, or 29 million Americans, would exceed the $250,000 threshold were they to sell their homes, while 10%, or eight million Americans, would surpass the $500,000 threshold for joint filers.",
      "As a result, older homeowners are disincentivized to sell their homes, in what NAR researchers refer to as a \"stay-put penalty.\" For example, seniors who might otherwise consider moving closer to family, or downsizing, are staying in place \u2014 and keeping housing inventory tied up.",
      "\"This stagnation in housing turnover is rippling through the entire market, driving up costs and limiting opportunity \u2014 exactly the opposite of what public policy should be encouraging,\" Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer,\u00a0 said in a statement. \"And it grows worse each month.\"",
      "Critics say eliminating the tax would only benefit wealthy Americans who can afford to pay tax on gains from home sales that exceed the limit.",
      "Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lot of home sellers already benefit from the $250,000 exclusion limit, and that eliminating the capital gains tax altogether would primarily benefit wealthier Americans who own residences that have appreciated by more than $250,000, or $500,000 in the case of joint filers.",
      "\"It wouldn't really move the needle for a regular family, unless you have a home that's appreciated a lot,\" Berner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If your home has appreciated by more than $1 million, there would be a benefit to removing the capital gains tax.\"",
      "Inventory release",
      "He also suspects abolishing the capital gains tax on home sales would release inventory onto the housing market.",
      "\"It could be a good thing for the market. In particular where inventory is constrained, it could benefit regular folks,\" Berner said.",
      "By contrast, eliminating the federal tax would also erase revenue paid to the government, and could spark increased interest from investors and speculators, which could also drive up home values. That would contribute to the nation's housing affordability problem, according to Berner.",
      "Nearly 27% of all homes sold in the first three months of the year were bought by investors \u2014 the highest share in at least five years, according to a report by real estate data provider BatchData.",

      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The new cola will be available for purchase online this fall and in stores next year, Pepsi said.",
      "The product announcement comes only months after Pepsi\u00a0acquired Poppi, which is marketed as a healthier alternative for soda lovers, for nearly $2 billion. The low-calorie soda contains a mix of prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider.",
      "The prebiotic and probiotic food and drink sector has grown quickly in recent years as consumers increasingly seek out gut-healthy alternatives to soda that contain less sugar.\u00a0According\u00a0to consulting firm Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at $262 million in 2024. Global sales are expected to grow 7.6% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"Consumer demand is certainly moving healthier,\" said Christopher Palmedo, an associate professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy. \"Decades ago, gargantuan Big Gulps were the rage. Now it's probiotic Pepsi.\"",
      "\"From a public health perspective, that's a good trend,\" Palmedo said, while noting that most beverages in the market, including probiotic drinks like Pepsi's are \"ultra-processed\" making their health claims questionable.",
      "While consumer preferences have shifted away from soda and toward healthier options, demand for carbonated drinks overall remains high. Nearly 80% U.S. consumers drink carbonated drinks at least once a week, according to Innova Market Insights.",
      "Pepsi is moving to introduce healthier offerings to boost lagging soda sales. On an earnings call last week, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will introduce protein-enhanced versions of its snacks and new protein beverages this year. He also said Pepsi will relaunch Lay's potato chips and Tostitos tortilla chips without artificial colors or ingredients.",
      "\"I think protein is clearly a subsegment in our food and beverages categories that is growing fast,\" Laguarta said in the July 17 call. \"Consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",

      "The\u00a0policy\u00a0enabled a price match if shoppers could provide proof of the lower price within 14 days of their purchase. The product had to be identical in brand name, size, weight, color and model number, and had to be sold and fulfilled by Amazon or Walmart, according to the Target policy.",
      "After July 28, customers will only be able to request a price match for products sold at either Target or Target.com, not competitors Amazon and Walmart, according to a Target spokesperson. The company said that it's ending price matching for products sold by the two rival retailers because \"guests overwhelmingly price match Target and not other retailers.\"",
      "Target introduced its competitor price match policy in 2013. At the time, former Target CEO and president Gregg Steinhafel said the policy provided \"unbeatable value.\"",

    "story": [
      "A child developed a rash after he was prevented from changing his underwear for four days. A little boy, bored and overcome with despair, began hitting himself in the head. A child with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was forced to go without his medication, despite his mother's pleas.",
      "\"I heard one officer say about us 'they smell like sh--,'\" one detained person recounted in a federal court filing. \"And another officer responded, 'They are sh--.'\"",
      "Attorneys for immigrant children collected these stories, and more, from youth and families detained in what they called \"prison-like\" settings across the U.S. from March through June, even as the Trump administration has requested a federal district court judge terminate existing protections that mandate basic rights and services \u2014 including safe and sanitary conditions \u2014 for children held by the government.",
      "The administration argues that the protections mandated under what is known as the Flores Settlement Agreement encourage immigration and interfere with its ability to establish immigration policy. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, who is in California, is expected to issue a ruling on the request after an Aug. 8 hearing.",
      "With the Flores agreement in place, children are being held in \"unsafe and unsanitary\" U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities such as tents, airports, and offices for up to several weeks despite the agency's written policy saying people generally should not be held in its custody longer than 72 hours, according to the June court filing from immigrants' attorneys. In addition to opposing the U.S. Department of Justice's May request to terminate the Flores consent decree, the attorneys demanded more monitoring for children in immigration detention.",
      "\"The biggest fear is that without Flores, we will lose a crucial line of transparency and accountability,\" said Sergio Perez, executive director of the California-based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. \"Then you have a perfect storm for the abuse of individuals, the violation of their rights, and the kind of treatment that this country doesn't stand for.\"",
      "The Flores agreement has set minimum standards and oversight for detained immigrant children since 1997, when it brought an end to a decade-long lawsuit filed on behalf of unaccompanied immigrant minors who had been subjected to poor treatment in unsafe and unsanitary conditions without access to medical care. It is named for Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old from El Salvador who was taken into U.S. custody in the mid-1980s, subjected to strip searches, and housed alongside unrelated men.",
      "The agreement established national standards for the protection of immigrant children detained by federal authorities, with requirements for safe and sanitary detention facilities, access to clean water, appropriate food, clothing, bedding, recreational and educational opportunities, sanitation, plus appropriate medical and mental health care. Children in immigrant detention range from infants to teens.",
      "In 2015, Gee ruled that the agreement includes children accompanied by adults.",
      "The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which includes both the Customs and Border Protection agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the administration's intent to end the Flores agreement or about the conditions in which kids are detained. In a May court filing, government attorneys argued, among other points, that the agreement improperly directs immigration decisions to the courts, not the White House. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also has said that the Flores agreement has \"incentivized illegal immigration,\" and that Congress and federal agencies have resolved the problems Flores was designed to fix.",
      "ICE detention facilities have the \"highest standards,\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in an email to KFF Health News. \"They are safe, clean, and hold illegal aliens who are awaiting final removal proceedings.\"",
      "Immigration lawyers and researchers have pushed back on the idea that the Flores agreement encourages migration, arguing that the conditions in people's homelands are driving them to move.",
      "President Trump is not the first president to seek to modify, or end, the agreement.",
      "In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration unsuccessfully sought to exempt accompanied minors from the Flores agreement, arguing that an influx of immigrants from Central America had overwhelmed the system.",
      "In 2019, following a policy that caused family separation, the first Trump administration announced it would replace Flores with new regulations to expand family detention and eliminate detention time limits. The courts rejected that plan, too.",
      "In 2024, President Joe Biden's administration successfully requested to remove the Department of Health and Human Services from the agreement after the Office of Refugee Resettlement incorporated some Flores standards into agency regulations.",
      "Allegations of unsafe conditions under the agreement also predate this latest immigration crackdown under Mr. Trump. One court filing from 2019 said that attorneys visiting two Texas detention centers found at least 250 infants, children, and teens, some of whom had been held at the facility for nearly a month. \"Children were filthy and wearing clothes covered in bodily fluids, including urine,\" the filing said.",
      "Seven children are known to have died while in federal custody from 2018 to 2019, according to media reports.",
      "And in 2023, 8-year-old Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez became sick and died while in Customs and Border Protection custody in Texas for nine days. Her parents had turned over medical records detailing the girl's medical history, including diagnoses of sickle cell disease and congenital heart disease, upon their detention. Yet her mother's repeated pleas for emergency medical care were ignored.",
      "Her family filed a wrongful death claim in May.",
      "Advocates attributed the deaths partly to prolonged detention in increasingly crowded facilities and delayed medical care. Officials have said they increased\u00a0medical services and acknowledged failures in the wake of the deaths.",
      "But with the Trump administration's unprecedented push to detain and deport migrants \u2014 including families \u2014 the threat to the health of children caught up in those sweeps is alarming child advocates.",
      "\"Very rarely do you have spikes in populations of detained folk that you don't see a drastic decrease in the quality of their medical care,\" said Daniel Hatoum, a senior supervising attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, one of the groups that filed the wrongful death claim for Anadith's family.",
      "Recent reports from court-appointed monitors cite continued lack of access to appropriate medical care; temperature extremes; few outside recreational opportunities; lack of appropriate food and clothing; and an inability to dim lights to sleep.",
      "Terminating the Flores agreement would remove all outside oversight of immigration detention facilities by court-ordered monitors and attorneys. The public would have to depend on the government for transparency about the conditions in which children are held.",
      "\"Our system requires that there be some oversight for government, not just the Department of Homeland Security, but in general,\" Hatoum said. \"We know that. So, I do not believe that DHS could police itself.\"",
      "In the months after Mr. Trump took office and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency began cuts, the administration shuttered DHS' Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which were intended to add a layer of oversight. After a lawsuit, the Trump administration reversed action and noted the offices would remain open, but it is unclear how those offices have been affected by shifts in policy and cuts in staffing.",
      "Leecia Welch, an attorney with the legal advocacy group Children's Rights, said the Flores agreement itself, or efforts to hold the government responsible for abiding by its requirements, are not rooted in partisan politics. She said she raised concerns about conditions during Biden's administration, too.",
      "\"These are not political issues for me,\" Welch said. \"How does our country want to treat children? That's it. It's very simple. I'm not going to take it easy on any administration where children are being harmed in their care.\"",

      "Spearman is one of at least 18 people convicted so far of leading and utilizing the dark web to share hundreds of thousands of unlawful sexually exploitative images of children.\tThe Justice Department calls the investigation and prosecutions Operation Grayskull; it helped secure those arrests and shutter four heavily trafficked dark web sites where violent and horrific images of child sexual abuse were traded and housed.",
      "The Operation Grayskull investigation launched in 2020, when law enforcement agents noticed a spike in traffic to a dark web site suspected of hosting child abuse material.

Spearman was accused of helping lead a dark web site with thousands of users and members.\tA sentencing memo submitted to the court said it was \"no wonder\" that he had tried to resist the FBI, rather than surrendering.",
      "\"The devices at his desk contained massive quantities of evidence proving that he was the lead administrator of Website A,\" the memo said. \"Unsurprisingly, the defendant's devices also contained an enormous collection of images and videos depicting the rape and abuse of children.\"",
      "Selwyn Rosenstein was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2022, for\u00a0 operating a dark website for unlawful exploitative images. Prosecutors said the platform \"was not simply a website; it was a large, active community of pedophiles and (abuse material) enthusiasts. And it existed in part because of the Defendant's criminal acts.\"",
      "Rosenstein possessed such a large quantity of abusive images, he needed to store some on a server he used to run his business, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Speaking from a second floor conference room at Justice Department headquarters in Washington last week, Galeotti told CBS News the members of these dark web child abuse sites often \"earn\" membership by paying a fee, \"helping moderate the site\" or contributing child abuse images or material.",
      "Galeotti said, \"We luckily have very sophisticated prosecutors and agents who work specifically on this kind of thing. These are people who have a more of a technical understanding.\"",
      "\"The defendants in this case, as sadistic as they may be, are somewhat sophisticated,\" and make use of encryption, he added.",
      "Operation Grayskull also secured the conviction of Matthew Garrell of Raleigh, North Carolina, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for operating on a dark web site for abuse material.",
      "\"Garrell engaged in an extremely complex and technologically sophisticated conspiracy that far exceeds the typical child-exploitation offenses,\" prosecutors said.",
      "They argued in a court filing that Garrell possessed a predator's \"handbook,\" with \"detailed instructions\" for grooming children for future abuse.",
      "The takedown of dark web leaders and users also included the convictions of men from Virginia, Maryland, Indiana, Texas, Washington, Arkansas, Michigan and Oklahoma.",
      "\"They were part of an online community of hundreds of thousands of people, with leadership roles rules and a common dedicated purpose\" said Chris Delzotto, an acting FBI deputy assistant director. Delzotto told CBS News, \"Few people would have envisioned how (child abuse materials) would permeate the internet, the way it has today.\"",
      "The federal investigation which uncovered and shuttered the first dark web site, also led to the closure of three others. Abbigail Beccaccio, an FBI unit chief, told CBS News. \"The leadership team that operated one of the sites also operated several of the others.\"",
      "The Justice Department is touting the shutdown of those sites as a victory to help deter future abuse or production of unlawful images. \"This is one of the most successful of all time,\" Galeotti said. \"We dismantled four websites that have not regenerated.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/project-2025-russell-vought-omb-fed-jerome-powell/",

    "summary": "Project 2025 lays out an overhaul of the Fed, saying \"Congress should limit its mandate to the sole objective of stable money.\"",
    "story": [
      "White House budget official Russell Vought, one of the authors of Project 2025, indicated Sunday that President Trump's focus on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is because the president wants lower interest rates, not because it is one of the mentioned targets of an overhaul in the conservative blueprint.",
      "\"I don't even know what that chapter says,\" Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" when talking about Project 2025 and the Federal Reserve. \"All I know, in terms of the president, the president has run on an agenda. He's been very clear about that.\"",
      "Overseen by the conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was a massive, multi-prong initiative for how a Republican president can introduce sweeping right-wing policy. Mr. Trump insisted on the campaign trail that he had \"nothing to do\" with Project 2025, and a 2024 CBS News analysis found that at least 270 of the nearly 700 policy proposals matched either campaign proposals or his first-term agenda. Since he took office, many of his policies have matched ones laid out in Project 2025.",
      "Project 2025 lays out an overhaul of the Fed, saying \"monetary dysfunction is related in part to the impossibility of fine-tuning the money supply in real time, as well as to the moral hazard inherent in a political system that has demonstrated a history of bailing out private firms when they engage in excess speculation.\"",
      "\"To protect the Federal Reserve's independence and to improve monetary policy outcomes, Congress should limit its mandate to the sole objective of stable money.\" Project 2025 says. Vought is not listed as one of the\u00a0 authors of that chapter, but he was one of the key intellectual drivers of the overall project and its recommendations.",
      "In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has sharply criticized Powell and has indicated he wants to fire Powell, but Mr. Trump has also said he didn't think it was necessary. The Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" and Mr. Trump has zeroed in on an extensive renovation project to two of the Federal Reserve's buildings under Powell's watch. Vought sent a letter on July 10 to Powell alleging the \"ostentatious\" office renovation project may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump visited the Fed on Thursday, where he and Powell clashed over the cost of those changes. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces. The Fed is self-funded, so taxpayer dollars are not appropriated for their costs.",
      "Powell's term is up in 2026, and House Speaker Mike Johnson told CBS News last week that he expects a \"rocky road\" ahead for Powell.",
      "Mr. Trump wants Powell to lower interest rates, but Powell has said the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation. Further, the decision to raise or lower interest rates is not Powell's alone \u2014 eight times a year, the Federal Open Market Committee, which has 12 members, votes on monetary policy.",
      "Despite the pressure from the Trump administration, the Fed is expected to hold steady on interest rates at its meeting this week.",
      "Vought said Sunday that Mr. Trump has been \"very clear that all he's asking from the Fed is lower interest rates, because he thinks it's important.\"",
      "\"When you look across the globe, and you have countries lowering rates, and yet we don't see that in this country, given all of the positive economic indicators that we're seeing,\" Vought said. \"And then we have fiscal mismanagement at the Fed with regard to this building renovation that I'm sure you will ask me about. Those are the kinds of things that we want to see from the Fed. This is not part of an existential issue with regard to the Federal Reserve.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Sunday that the United States and the European Union had reached a trade deal after high-stakes meetings in Scotland, just days shy of Friday's White House deadline to enact tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump met with top European officials demanding fairer trade with the 27-member European Union at his golf course on the Scottish coast.",
      "\"It was a very interesting negotiation. I think it's going to be great for both parties,\" the president said.",
      "The deal, according to European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, is a 15% tariff across the board. She praised Mr. Trump, calling it a \"good deal\" and a \"huge deal\" that followed \"tough negotiations.\"",
      "\"We have a deal. We have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world, and it's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" she said. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said, \"I think we both wanted to make a deal,\" and he predicted it would \"bring us closer together.\" Mr. Trump also said more than once to reporters Sunday that it was the \"biggest of all the deals.\"",
      "Von der Leyen said the negotiations addressed the EU's trade surplus with the U.S., and the deal would be carried out in a way that would enable trade to continue while jobs on \"both sides of the Atlantic\" would be rebalanced.",
      "According to Mr. Trump, the deal also includes that all European Union countries will be \"opened up for U.S. goods\" at 0% and the bloc will invest $600 billion in the U.S. The EU will also purchase $750 billion of U.S. energy as part of the deal.",
      "\"They are going to agree to invest into the United States $600 billion more than they're investing already,\" Mr. Trump said. \"So they're investing a large amount of money. You know what that amount of money is--It's very substantial.\"",
      "In remarks before the session, Mr. Trump pledged to change what he characterized as \"a very one-sided transaction, very unfair to the United States.\"",
      "\"I think the main sticking point is fairness,\" he said while also noting, \"We've had a hard time with trade with Europe, a very hard time.\"",
      "Without a deal, Mr. Trump had threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tariff rate. The president has long been critical of the U.S.-EU trade relationship, claiming the U.S. has been treated unfairly. Last year, the U.S. trade deficit with the EU was about $235 billion.",
      "Joining von der Leyen were Maros Sefcovic, the EU's chief trade negotiator; Bj\u00f6rn Seibert, the head of von der Leyen's Cabinet; Sabine Weyand, the commission's directorate-general for trade, and Tomas Baert, head of trade and agriculture at the EU's delegation to the U.S.",
      "Von der Leyen had a mandate to negotiate because the European Commission handles trade for member countries. But the Commission should now present the deal to member states and EU lawmakers \u2014 who will ultimately decide whether or not to approve it",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Sunday welcomed the trade deal, which he said avoided \"needless escalation in transatlantic trade relations.\"",
      "\"We have thus managed to preserve our fundamental interests, even if I would have wished for more relief in transatlantic trade,\" he said in a statement released soon after the deal was announced.",

Leaving behind the Epstein files controversy, Trump teed off in Scotland for a weekend of golf, ahead of trade talks with two key European leaders, as his tariff deadline looms.",

      "RUSSELL VOUGHT (Director, Office of Management and Budget): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much to get to with you. Let's start on what's going on with the Federal Reserve.",
      "If you take the president at his word, he does not intend to fire the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, though he's still criticizing him. What is the president seeking in a successor when his term ends in May 2026?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, I think he's looking for a chairman that's not continually too late to the developments in the economic marketplace.",
      "And I think what we've seen with Chairman Powell, he was very late in the Biden administration to raise rates, to articulate the concern with regard to the Biden administration's spending.",
      "We all knew on the outside \u2013 even Larry Summers knew that we were going to have an issue with regard to inflation. And we saw, you know, recent historical inflationary levels that we hadn't seen before. And now he is too late to lower inflation rates. And so that is the kind of thing that we want to see in the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.",
      "And one of the reasons why is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: More of a focus on inflation?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: An ability to recognize the developments in the economic marketplace.",
      "In this case, we want to be able to see lower rates and to have an ability to get the economy going.",
      "And one of the things we saw with Powell is that one of the reasons he was so late was because he didn't understand that inflation is largely a monetary phenomenon. He kept saying that inflation was transitory. He didn't tackle the problem. And now he's again too late.",
      "And you marry that with fiscal mismanagement at the Fed. It's a huge problem that we're trying to raise the country's awareness level with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as you know, the Fed is structured in a way where he doesn't have unilateral control. There's a governing board. Others weigh in.",
      "You did work on Project 2025, and we went back and looked at what they said in there about the Fed. As people may know, that's a Heritage Foundation product that got a lot of scrutiny during the campaign. The chapter on the Fed called for Congress to overhaul the Fed's focus and powers.",
      "Is that what you're looking to do in 2026?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: I don't even know what that chapter says.",
      "All I know, in terms of the president, the president has run on an agenda. He's been very clear about that. All that we're doing is \u2013 in this administration is running on \u2013 is implementing his agenda.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't want to overhaul the Fed?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We want an economic system that works for the American people. That includes the Fed. And the president has been very clear that all he's asking from the Fed is lower interest rates, because he thinks it's important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I do want to ask about spending, or lack thereof, that the Trump administration is trying to direct.",
      "The White House said they will actually release the remaining $5 billion in education funds that had been withheld from public schools until recently. There were 10 Republican senators very worried about this, and came out and said your claim that the money goes to radical left-wing programs was wrong.",
      "What changed your mind? What made you release this money?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, we had been going through a programmatic review with these funds. These are programs that, as an administration, we don't support. We've called for the elimination of them in the president's budget for precisely the reasons of which they flow to often left-wing organizations.",
      "Thankfully, the president came into office, put in an executive order that said it can't \u2013 these funds can't go to these types of initiatives. I will just give you one example. English language acquisition was flowing to the New York school public education system to go into illegal immigration advocacy organizations.",
      "Preschool development grants doesn't actually go to preschoolers. It goes to the curriculum for putting CRT into the school system for people as young \u2013 children as young as 4 years old.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these senators said it goes to adult learners working to gain employment skills and after-school programs.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: And what we\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you deemed it is necessary?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We believe that it's important to get the money out right now, but we have taken an extended time frame to be able to make sure it doesn't go to the types of things that we saw under the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, you know, Senator Lindsey Graham told \"The Washington Post\" the administration is looking at considering clawbacks from the Department of Education, this, you know, rescissions process.",
      "Is that the plan? Are you seeking to claw back education funds in a rescissions package? And, if so, when are you sending that up?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We may be. We're always looking at potential rescission options.",
      "This is an \u2013 this is a set of funding that we wanted to make sure it got out. We did our programmatic review. We wanted to make sure it got out before the school year, even though it's multiyear funding. This is not funding that would expire at the end of this year. We are looking to do rescissions package.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When\u2026",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We're always gauging the extent to which the Congress is willing to participate in that process. And we're \u2013 be looking at a lot of different options along those lines, but certainly have nothing to announce here today.",
      "But we're thrilled that we had the first rescissions package in decades, and we've got the process moving again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no rescissions package before September?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Not here to say that. We're looking at all of our options. We will look at it and assess where the Hill is, what are the particular funding opportunities that we have, but nothing that we're going to announce today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because some of the funds that do expire in September have also been held up on the health front.",
      "Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, 13 other Republicans came out with a letter saying that you've been slow in releasing funds for the National Institute of Health for research into cardiovascular disease, cancer. Are those funds going to be released?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Again, we're going through the same process with the NIH that we did with the education.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's a time cost here.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: I mean, $2 million for injecting dogs with cocaine that the NIH spent money on, $75,000 for Harvard to study blowing lizards off of trees with leaf blowers, that's the kind of waste that we've seen at the NIH.",
      "And that's not even getting to the extent to which the NIH was weaponized against the American people over the last several years, with regard to funding gain of function research that caused the pandemic. We have a \u2013 we have an agency that needs dramatic overhaul. Thankfully, we have a great new head of it, but we're going to have to go line by line to make sure the NIH is funded properly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to release the cancer funding research and the cardiovascular disease research funding?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We're going to continue \u2013 we're going to continue to go to the same process that we have gone through with regard to the Department of Education at every one of these agencies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before September, that money will be released?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: And we will release that funding when we are done with that review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, there's concern that you're withholding the money, hoping it just won't be spent.",
      "I mean, if you look at the White House budget, it does call for a 26 percent cut to HHS, $18 billion cut to NIH. Is this just a backdoor way to make those cuts happen?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, I don't want to speak to any specific program with regard to what we might do with regard to rescissions throughout the end of this fiscal year, but we certainly recognize that we have the ability and the executive tools to fund less than what Congress appropriated and to use the tools that the Impoundment Control Act, a bill we're not \u2013 a law that we're not entirely thrilled with, gives us to \u2013 to send up rescissions towards the end of the fiscal year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, just for our viewers, the Impoundment Control Act is the legal mechanism for the president to use to delay or avoid spending funds appropriated by Congress.",
      "Democrats think you want to have an argument over the power of the purse and who holds it. Do you want that to go to the Supreme Court?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, look, for 200 years, presidents had the ability to spend less than the congressional appropriations. No one would ever dispute and our founders didn't dispute that Congress has the ability to set the appropriation ceiling.",
      "But 200 years of presidents, up until the 1970s, had the ability to spend less if they could find efficiencies or if they could find waste that an agency was doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a yes.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We lost that ability in the 1970s. The president ran on restoring that funding authority to the presidency, and it's vital.",
      "If you look at when we started to lose control fiscally, it was right around the time of the 1970s.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, many senators, Republican senators, are very uncomfortable with the tactics that you are using, Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins, that chair of the Appropriations Committee that is really running this \u2013 this funding process.",
      "And Senator Collins said you're pushing the limits of what the executive can do without the consent of the \u2013 of the legislative branch. You need to work with her to get your budget through. And, in fact, you need to also be able to get Democrats on board to get to that 60-vote threshold to pass any kind of government funding to avoid a government shutdown at the end of September.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: I have a great relationship with Senator Collins. I appreciate the work she does.",
      "She is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, so obviously we're going to have differences of opinion as to the extent to which these tools should be used. I mean, she had concerns with the rescissions package. The rescissions package was a vote that Congress had to make these cuts permanent. And yet\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Under \u2013 on a party-line vote. She says, you want to go do these clawbacks, you do it through regular order, and you can put \u2013 you can put rescissions into an appropriations bill.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: But that was, in fact, under regular order. That's the challenge, is, the appropriators want to use all the rescissions, they want to put them in their bills, and then they want to spend higher on other programs.",
      "We act \u2013 we're $37 trillion in debt, Margaret. We actually need to reduce the deficit and have a dollar of cut go to a dollar of deficit reduction. That's not what the appropriators want. And it's not news that the Trump administration is going to bring a paradigm shift to this town in terms of the business of spending the people's money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would acknowledge that you just added to the debt and to the deficit with this\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: No, I would not acknowledge that. We reduced the deficit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The spending and tax bill that just passed?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Correct. We\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you lifted the debt ceiling.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: The debt ceiling is an \u2013 is \u2013 is an extension of the cap on what's needed to pay your previous bills.",
      "In terms of the bill itself, it is $400 billion in deficit reduction, $1.5 trillion in mandatory savings reforms, the biggest we've seen in history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, a few weeks ago, that the appropriations process needs to be less bipartisan. You only have 53 Republicans. You do need Democrats to get on board, here.",
      "Is saying something like that intended to undermine negotiations? Do you actually want a government shutdown?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: No, of course not. We want to extend the funding at the end of this fiscal year. We understand, from a math perspective, we're going to need Democrats to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does less bipartisan mean?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, Margaret, the whole week, the Democrats were making the argument that, if you pass the rescissions bill, that you were undermining the bipartisan appropriations process.",
      "So, if Brian Schatz and every other appropriator is making that argument for a week\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, a Republican, said that.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: \u2026 you have to be able to respond and say, if you're going to call a rescissions package that you told us during the month of January and February that we should use to do less spending, if you're going to say that is undermining the bipartisan appropriations process, then maybe we should have a conversation about that. That is all it was meant to convey.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the alternative to this process is another continuing resolution, these stopgap measures. Are you open to that, because that would lock in Biden era funding? What is your alternative here? If you want a less bipartisan process, how do you solve for this? Because it sounds like you're laying the predicate for a shutdown.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We are open to \u2013 we are not laying the predicate for a shutdown. We are laying the predicate for the fact that the only thing that has worked in this town \u2013 the bipartisan appropriations process is broken.",
      "It leads to omnibus bills. We want to prevent an omnibus bill, and all options are on the table to be able to do that.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is one of those appropriators we were just speaking about with the budget director.",
      "You just heard everything he laid out. There were no specifics on when these clawbacks could be coming, but they're on the table. He says they don't want a shutdown. He didn't seem to say they want a continuing resolution.",
      "Do you know what's coming?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-Maryland): Not really.",
      "The one thing we know \u2013 and you asked Russ Vought about this \u2013 was, he says that the process is too bipartisan right now, meaning that they want to use this process just to ram through the agenda. And the overall agenda, we saw when they passed the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which was beautiful for billionaires, but not really for anybody else, which is to provide tax cuts for very wealthy people at the expense of everybody else.",
      "And I do want to say, Margaret, I heard him deny that that bill increased the deficit and debt. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office just said it increased our debt by $3.5 trillion before added interest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's using an accounting gimmick in regard to the benchmark.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: As \u2013 and Republicans have called out this accounting gimmick. So, when they come\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it was accepted.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, they sort of unilaterally imposed it. It was not accepted by Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: And it was a departure from previous efforts.",
      "But then they come back and they say that they want to cut these important programs, NIH and other things, to reduce the deficit, when, in fact, what they're doing it for is to help try to finance those tax cuts for very wealthy people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's just heading us towards pretty unchartered territory and very unclear whether we will be able to avoid a government shutdown.",
      "Democrats are going to be blamed if there's a shutdown, don't you think? I mean, how do you sidestep this?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, we certainly don't want a government shutdown. And I think everybody has heard Russ Vought say that they want a less bipartisan process.",
      "What that tells me is they're willing just to use their powers to try to shut down the government if they don't get their way. And what's ironic about this, Margaret, is, you have Russ Vought calling for these deep cuts to education, NIH, when he has asked for an increase for his OMB budget.",
      "He asked for a 13 percent increase for his OMB budget. He's asked for more people to join the OMB staff, while he's talking about RIFing people at other departments, like the Department of\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes, getting rid of firing people in the Department of Veterans Affairs and other important priorities.",
      "So it's hard to take the OMB director seriously when he says that they didn't increase the debt and when he says he wants to cut things, except for his own budget and staff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if they do head towards a government shutdown, why would there be any benefit, unless it is to prioritize funding certain agencies and deprioritizing other agencies?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, that\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that goes back to the executive, doesn't it, that authority?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, that \u2013 ultimately, though, you need, for example, four Republican senators to stand behind what he's calling for.",
      "And what they called for is sort of just a double cross on the process, right? That's what the so-called \u2013 rescissions is just a Washington name for double cross. They support one thing one day. The president even signs off. And then they come back and say they changed their mind.",
      "And what we're asking is for four Republican senators just to publicly declare that, when they say they're going to fund the Veterans Affairs Department, that they actually mean it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That they won't later agree to claw that money back.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "So one of the things the Trump administration is clear and did get clawbacks of is foreign assistance. However, there's an exception. In June, the administration announced it would give $30 million to this Israeli- backed organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the GHF. I know you're familiar with it.",
      "It delivers aid through armed military contractors who stand behind the Israeli military in four designated zones that Gazans then have to get themselves to in order to receive the aid. The State Department says they're sending this money. Have they?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: To my knowledge, they have. Although we have asked for the details, we haven't gotten them.",
      "In fact, just today, I'm sending a letter to Secretary Rubio signed with 20 of my colleagues calling for more information, but also calling for defunding this. American taxpayers should not be spending one penny to fund this private organization backed by mercenaries and by the IDF that has become a death trap.",
      "Over 1,000 people have died from being shot and killed as starving people crowd to try to get food at just these four sites.",

      "Reuters had reported that there were documents they obtained showing $7 million had already been sent to these what you call armed mercenaries. But the Trump administration says this is the best way, this is the only way to keep money \u2013 to keep food out of the hands of Hamas, which financially benefits off reselling it to desperate, starving people.",
      "Is there another way to feed desperate, starving people?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes. And this is a big lie, the claim that, when the U.N. organizations were delivering food to Palestinians, civilians, that it was being systematically diverted to Hamas.",
      "I want to say loudly and clearly this is a big lie. Trump and the\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The systematic part of that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: The systematic, but that is their claim. They claim that essentially large amounts of aid are being diverted to Hamas.",
      "What we know now from testimony of American officials, Cindy McCain and just this week high-level Israeli military officials is that there's no evidence to support that. AID \u2013 USAID just released a report saying there's no evidence to support that.",
      "So what the Netanyahu government did was scrap a delivery system that was working at delivering food and assistance in favor of this other effort. That was a pretext, this claim that Hamas was systematically diverting food. The real goal of this other effort is to use food as a weapon of war and population control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a violation of international law.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes, it is.",

      "The United States is a huge supporter of the state of Israel. Is there anything that could prevent what he says is about to happen?",

      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, we also know just this week members of the Netanyahu coalition, in fact, government ministers, called for essentially erasing Gaza, and they said it will become a Jewish state, statelet, and part of \u2013 so this was one of the\u2026",

      "ELIZABETH PALMER (voice over): In an abrupt reversal, Israel cleared the way for more aid to Gaza. Overnight, the military air dropped food and supplies. But those pallets are a fraction of what's needed. The bulk of the aid is on trucks, waiting to go. And in what could be a game changer, Israel says it will establish secure routes through the war zone so that trucks will no longer be shot at or looted.",
      "Gaza's misery has shocked the world. And international medical agencies say children, especially the poorest and those with special needs, are suffering from acute malnutrition.",
      "Since March, when the ceasefire ended, aid has trickled into the war zone, but not nearly enough. Israel sidelined the main U.N. agencies and funneled most aid through the privately run Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has only four distribution hubs for 2 million people.",
      "As hunger grew, so did reports of Israeli soldiers shooting a crowds trying to get something to eat. Even so, desperation pushed Gazans to risk death, plundering aid from moving convoys.",
      "Alongside the shooting war, there was also a war of words. Israel's military insisted it was letting in plenty of aid, it's just the U.N. agencies weren't picking it up. The agencies said the army made it too dangerous.",
      "And while the blame game played out, Gazans grew thinner and sicker.",

      "Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation. Overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states, are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT (Foreign Minister of France): What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is \u2013 is \u2013 is now on the brink of a food catastrophe. And we've been working out over the months to try and relieve the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in Elavish (ph), in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza.",
      "So, we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity afforded by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: We have with the European Union started tough discussions with the Israeli government who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused blood bath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions.",
      "We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects, with 3,400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political \u2013 a two-state solution.",
      "But what we call for is, of course, the immediate ceasefire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed, and the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two-state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the U.N. in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first Western U.N. Security Council member to do so.",
      "And the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it \"reckless.\" He says it \"serves Hamas propaganda,\" \"sets back peace,\" and considers it \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th.\"",
      "In your government's view, why is he wrong?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: So, we \u2013 the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two-state solution process, that was \u2013 that is today threatened, more threatened, that it \u2013 it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone because by work \u2013 by \u2013 by recognizing or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has \u2013 that will be co-chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant, historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of this two- state solution and guarantee its security guarantees for (INAUDIBLE).",
      "The two-state solution is very simple. And I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back into this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and in security. And what we're doing by bringing the Palestinian authority leader to recognize 7th of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas \u2013 the disarmament for the \u2013 the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating or recreating the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward. And we are paving the way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said. The U.S. ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary. We shall \u2013 the short-term objectives, ceasefire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas and the long-term objective, peace and stability in the region.",
      "But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics (ph), a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the \u2013 or create an off-ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza.",
      "Now, the terms we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords. But in the meantime, inaction is not an option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out, though, and said, \"the French students were removed because they're Jewish.\" Have you determined whether this was, indeed, an act of anti- Semitism?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has \u2013 to express our \u2013 our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in \u2013 in France, and we've made the same request. We keep following this situation as it unravels.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, to \u2013 to early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon and the world won't know.",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing. And alongside the Germany and the U.K., we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority, in close coordination with U.S. authorities, in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant roll-back of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things have changed. Until then and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement.",
      "We now want more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also its \u2013 the ballistic component as well as the regional destabilization activity that Iran has been conducting. Unless we \u2013 unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the U.K. will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted ten years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment and on banking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: Oh, we've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We \u2013 we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran after the 12-day war to go back to a discussion with the U.S. And we'll keep pressing them to do so because indeed if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.",

      "President Carter, welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "TED CARTER (President, Ohio State University): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you on this Sunday from Columbus, Ohio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you very directly about these Trump administration claims that Ohio State is one of 60 universities that they deemed may have anti-Semitic practices and policies on campus. They say you're being investigated for them and for failing to end diversity policies, which could be a violation of the Civil Rights Act. What's the status of the probes and \u2013 and how much pressure are you under?",
      "TED CARTER: To be quite frank, I'm not feeling a lot of pressure. Our understanding is that we're on those lists because we had been previously on those lists under the Biden administration. We had been working with the Office of Civil Rights during that administration. And I think mostly that was a holdover.",
      "We are more than happy to talk to anybody from the Office of Civil Rights. We stand behind our actions. We know how we acted during the time of the protests. We never had an encampment here at Ohio State. We had some attempted. We didn't allow them. That's our long-standing rules on The Oval, which is the centerpiece of our campus. So, I'm confident that as this played out forward, that we're going to be just fine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration did publish Ohio State on the list of universities it's probing. And when you look at some of the issues they've raised at other places, you look at the results of freezing $3 billion in contracts at Harvard, $1 billion at Cornell, hundreds of millions of dollars of research funding at universities like Brown. Are you worried that your federal funds could be in jeopardy because of this?",
      "TED CARTER: Well, like I always say to my staff and my people, if we do the right things for the right reasons, everything will play out. And we've been doing it that way since I've been here since 1 January of 2024. Our research funding here at Ohio State has grown leaps and bounds over the last couple years. We're actually ranked number 11th in the country, ahead of Harvard, ahead of UNC-Chapel Hill. Our revenues last year were $1.6 billion, $775 million of that came from the federal government, largely in NIH and NSF.",
      "As we sit here today, we've had some research grants impacted, but in the tens of millions of dollars. Nothing like you're seeing at our Ivy League colleagues. And a lot of that is still in litigation. So, I can't even tell you what the \u2013 the number of dollars that we may lose. But against the $1.6 billion, it's pretty small, even though it's had some impact on some of our researchers.",
      "Unlike some of our counterparts, we have a significant research arm here, 14,000 faculty, post doc students that do the research here, and it is significant. It goes way beyond the numbers and the dollars. It's what it's doing for the community, what it's doing to extend and save and change lives and what it's doing in agriculture, what it's doing for our police force.",
      "So, what I would tell you is the \u2013 at this moment today, even compared to where we were last year, we're still up in our research revenue about 7 percent from where we were last year. And we're \u2013 we're proceeding to ask for more grants so that we can be a cancer-free world here in our lifetime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we all hope for that future, sir.",
      "But you sound not to be concerned, but I did read that earlier when you had the Buckeyes football team at the White House earlier in the year, and that was well covered, \"The Wall Street Journal\" said you told President Trump and Vice President Vance that, quote, \"Ohio State is not the enemy.\"",
      "Why did you feel you had to say that? What did you mean?",
      "TED CARTER: Well, that might have been taken a little bit out of context. I kind of said that in jest a little bit to the vice president when I had a chance to meet with him. And we had a long conversation. It was a very productive conversation. I won't go into all the details.",
      "But the point is, they know that Ohio State is doing the right things for the right reasons. I have said publicly that I believe the future of higher education is going to go through the large public land grant flagship institutions like The Ohio State University.",
      "I look at what we're doing today. And, yes, like many other universities, there's a lot of concern about the future, what's coming out of the federal government, and even what's coming out of our state government here in Ohio. But right now, I feel like we can still play defense, still understand how to adjust, kind of make sure that we're getting our bat on the ball, so to speak, and playing defense and protecting the plate. But we're also looking at how we can play offense.",
      "This is a time where institutions like Ohio State, we are very financially secure. We're actually looking to invest in ourselves. You know, I just reflect on the graduation ceremony that we just had this past May. We produce about 18,000 graduates a year. But at that ceremony, we graduated 12,400. All of them, by the way, got their diploma that day that they earned. And 90 percent of those students, 90 percent, already had a job or they were going to another higher academic endeavor. And 70 percent of those undergraduate students are staying in the state of Ohio, 66 percent of the Ph.D. and masters are staying in the state of Ohio.",
      "This is a wonderful workforce development program that is what is raising the confidence of Ohioans and the American public in higher education. And that is starting to change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance was on this program a number of times. And one when them when he was still a senator. I spoke to him about his views on higher education. He is an Ohio State alum undergrad. And he said he believes universities \u2013 he wasn't speaking of yours, but he said \"universities are controlled by left-wing foundations and they're going in the wrong direction.\"",
      "Do you think he has a point?",
      "TED CARTER: I think higher education has started to build that reputation. And you can even see that in the Gallup-Lumina polls. You know, I was the superintendent of the Naval Academy from 2014 to 2019. You know, in that Gallup poll in 2015 said that nearly 60 percent of Americans had high confidence in post-secondary education.",
      "Now, go ahead and just move that needle nine years forward, and yet two in three Americans said they did not have confidence in higher education. That's a really bad mark. Americans were saying higher education costs too much. They were saying that the return on investment was difficult to prove. They were even saying some of the research being done may not impact them or their families. And, yes, there was this conversation about the potential indoctrination of students or that institutions were leaning very liberal.",
      "You know, we, as administrators of higher education, maybe ought to listen to the American public and say, maybe we haven't always gotten it right. So, I'm here to say here at The Ohio State University, we have paid attention to that. We are making efforts to make affordability a key issue for students.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TED CARTER: I mentioned that graduating class, 57 percent of those undergraduates left with zero debt. Zero debt. And the other 43 percent that left with debt was less than $24,000. And as we look across, you know, our hiring practices, I have 8,500 faculty.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TED CARTER: It is the best group of faculty I have ever worked with in my 12 years in leading in higher ed, and that's saying quite a bit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I \u2013 on that \u2013",
      "TED CARTER: And I will tell you that as we hire the future, we're looking across the entire political spectrum for who we hire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On that point, you talked about what happened at the state level. The Republican-controlled state legislature passed a law that eliminates the diversity programs, does a number of things, but it also requires professors to post their course syllabus, syllabi, online, and their contact information.",
      "Do you think that this is meant to intimidate? Are you concerned? Is your faculty concerned about the focus on what they're doing?",
      "TED CARTER: Yes, I have talked to our faculty, our \u2013 you know, through our faculty senate and our leadership. There are some concerns, of course, because we have not done that before. We've got some time before we implement that. We have put all the pieces of Senate Bill 1, which is the general assembly's bill here in the state of Ohio, into implementation phase. We're still working through some of the details.",
      "But let me tell you, the principles of academic freedom, what is taught in the classroom, the \u2013 the move towards scholarly pursuit, the research that we do here at Ohio State, those are things that we are still very passionate about. And I know that we're going to continue that work. And yet we'll still follow the law. We'll still follow some of the federal policies that are coming out.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Columbus, Ohio and the president of The Ohio State University, Ted Carter. President Carter, welcome to 'Face The Nation.'",
      "OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT TED CARTER: Margaret, good to be with you on this Sunday from Columbus, Ohio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you very directly about these Trump administration claims that Ohio State is one of 60 universities that they deemed may have antisemitic practices and policies on campus. They say you're being investigated for them and for failing to end diversity policies, which could be a violation of the Civil Rights Act. What's the status of the probes? And how much pressure are you under?",
      "CARTER: To be quite frank, I'm not feeling a lot of pressure. Our understanding is we're on those lists because we had been previously on those lists under the Biden administration. We had been working with the Office of Civil Rights during that administration, and I think mostly that was a holdover. We are more than happy to talk to anybody from the Office of Civil Rights. We stand behind our actions. We know how we acted during the time of the protests. We never had an encampment here at Ohio State. We had some attempted we didn't allow that, and that's our long-standing rules on the Oval, which is the centerpiece of our campus. So I'm confident that as this plays out forward, that we're going to be just fine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration did publish Ohio State on the list of universities it's probing, and when you look at some of the issues they've raised at other places, you look at the result of freezing $3 billion in contracts at Harvard, $1 billion at Cornell, hundreds of millions of dollars of research funding at universities like Brown. Are you worried that your federal funds could be in jeopardy because of this?",
      "CARTER: Well, like I always say to my staff and my people, if we do the right things for the right reasons, everything will play out. And we've been doing it that way since I've been here since 1 January of 2024. Our research funding here at Ohio State has grown leaps and bounds over the last couple years. We're actually ranked number 11 in the country, ahead of Harvard, ahead of UNC Chapel Hill. Our revenues last year were $1.6 billion, 775 million of that came from the federal government, largely in NIH and NSF. As we sit here today, we've had some research grants impacted, but in the tens of millions of dollars, nothing like you're seeing at our Ivy League colleagues, and a lot of that is still in litigation. So I can't even tell you what the number of dollars that we may lose, but against the $1.6 billion it's pretty small, even though it's had some impact on some of our researchers. Unlike some of our counterparts, we have a significant research arm here, 14,000 faculty, post doc students, that do the research here. And it is significant. It goes way beyond the numbers and the dollars. It's what it's what it's doing for the community, what it's doing to extend and save and change lives, and what it's doing in agriculture, what it's doing for our police force. So what I would tell you is, at this moment today- even compared to where we were last year, we're still up in our research revenue about 7% from where we were last year, and we're- we're- we're proceeding to ask for more grants so that we can be a cancer free world here in our lifetime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we all hope for that future, sir, but you sound not to be concerned. But I did read that earlier when you had the buckeyes football team at the White House earlier in the year- and that was well covered, the Wall Street Journal said you told President Trump and Vice President Vance that quote, Ohio State is not the enemy. Why did you feel you had to say that? What did you mean?",
      "CARTER: Well, that might have been taken a little bit out of context. I kind of said that in jest, a little bit to the vice president when I had a chance to meet with him, and we had a long conversation. It was a very productive conversation. I won't go into all the details, but the point is, they know that Ohio State is doing the right things for the right reasons. I have said publicly that I believe the future of higher education is going to go through the large public land grant flagship institutions like the Ohio State University, I look at what we're doing today, and yes, like many other universities, there's a lot of concern about the future, what's coming out of the federal government, even what's coming out of our state government here in Ohio. But right now, I feel like we can still play defense, still understand how to adjust, kind of make sure that we're getting our bat on the ball, so to speak, in playing defense and protecting the plate, but we're also looking at how we can play offense. This is a time where institutions like Ohio State, we are very financially secure. We're actually looking to invest in ourselves. I just reflect on the graduation ceremony that we just had this past May. We produce about 18,000 In graduates a year. But at that ceremony, we graduated 12,400- all of them, by the way, got their diploma that day that they earned. And 90% of those students- 90% already had a job or they were going to another higher academic endeavor. And 70% of those undergraduate students are staying in the state of Ohio. 66% of the PhD and masters are staying in the state of Ohio. This is a wonderful workforce development program. That is what is raising the confidence of Ohioans and the American public in higher education, and that is starting to change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance was on this program a number of times- and one of them when he was still a senator. I spoke to him about his views on higher education. He's an Ohio State alum, undergrad, and he said he believes universities- he wasn't speaking of yours, but he said universities are 'controlled by left wing foundations,' and they're going in the wrong direction. Do you think he has a point?",
      "CARTER: I think higher education has started to build that reputation. And you can even see that in the Gallup-Lumina polls. You know, I was the superintendent of the Naval Academy from 2014 to 2019 you know, and that Gallup poll in 2015 said that nearly 60% of Americans had high confidence in post-secondary education. Now go ahead and just move that needle nine years forward, and yet, two in three Americans said they did not have confidence in higher education. That's a really bad mark. Americans were saying higher education costs too much. They were saying that the return on investment was difficult to prove. They even were saying some of the research being done may not impact them or their families. And yes, there was this conversation about the potential indoctrination of students, or that institutions were leaning very liberal. You know, we as administrators of higher education maybe ought to listen to the American public and say, maybe we haven't always gotten it right. So I'm here to say, here at the Ohio State University, we have paid attention to that. We are making efforts to make affordability a key issue for students. I mentioned that graduating class, 57% of those undergraduates left with zero debt. Zero debt. And the other 43% that left with debt was less than $24,000. And as we look across our hiring practices, I have 8,500 faculty. It is the best group of faculty I have ever worked with in my 12 years of leading in higher and that's saying quite a bit. I will tell you that as we hire the future, we're looking across the entire political spectrum for who we hire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On that point, you talked about what happened at the state level. The Republican controlled state legislature passed a law that eliminates the diversity programs, it does a number of things. But it also requires professors to post their course syllabus- syllabi online and their contact information. Do you think that this is meant to intimidate? Are you concerned? Is your faculty concerned about the focus on what they're doing?",
      "CARTER: Yes, I have talked to our faculty through our faculty senate and our leadership. There are some concerns, of course, because we've not done that before. We've got some time before we implement that. We have put all the pieces of Senate Bill 1 which is the General Assembly's bill here in the state of Ohio, into the implementation phase. We're still working through some of the details, but let me tell you the principles of academic freedom, what is taught in the classroom, the move towards scholarly pursuit, the research that we do here at Ohio State, those are things that we are still very passionate about, and I know that we're going to continue that work, and yet we'll still follow the law. We'll still follow some of the federal policies that are coming out. We're ready and prepared to do all of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To that point, you saw what Columbia University did this week in paying the $200 million fine to settle their dispute with the Trump administration, they also agreed to an outside monitor to assure the school complies with stamping out diversity programs. Does this precedent trouble you? I mean- would you take a deal like that?",
      "CARTER: Well, I can't speak to those institutions because I'm not leading them. I know both President Shipman and some of the other Ivy League presidents are colleagues, and they're having to do I think what I would call be in survival mode. Quite frankly, we're not going through any of that here at Ohio State, and nor do I think that we will. I mean, obviously we have a new state law. We're a public institution, so that means we're going to be transparent and put out everything that we do so the state of Ohio, the people and the entire country can see it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch to see what happens. Good luck to you, sir. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to French Foreign Minister, Jean\u2011No\u00ebl\u202fBarrot, who joins us this morning from Paris. Welcome to \"Face The Nation.\" I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?",
      "FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-NO\u00cbL BARROT: What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is- is- is now in the brink of a full catastrophe, and we've been working out, over the months, to try and relief the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in El-Arish in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza. So we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity offered by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered, and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?",
      "BARROT: We have, with the European Union, started tough discussions with the Israeli government, who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused bloodbath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions. We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects with 3400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political, a two state solution. But what we call for is, of course, the immediate cease-fire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas, that needs to be disarmed. And the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the UN in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first western UN Security Council member to do so, and the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it \"reckless.\" He says it serves Hamas propaganda, sets back peace, and considers it \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7.\" In your government's view, why is he wrong?",
      "BARROT: So the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two state solution process that was- that is today threatened, more threatened that it- it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone, because by- by- by recognizing, or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has- that will be co chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of the two state solution, and guarantee security guarantees for Israel. The two state solution is very simple, and I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back in this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and in security. This perspective is now threatened, and it's why the- the dynamic that we have initiated was so important, and this is why the conference that will take place in New York is such an important milestone. All these efforts are very, very complementary to the efforts that the U.S. have done in the region since the first term of President Trump. We share the short-term objective: immediate cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed. We share the long term objective: peace and stability in the region. And what we're doing, by bringing the Palestinian Authority leader to recognize seventh of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas- the disarm- for the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority, and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating, or recreating, the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward, and we are paving the way. We're paving the way for the future Abraham Accords that the U.S. administration might lead. So I see our effort as very complementary to the U.S. administration's effort, rather than substitutes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said, the U.S. Ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?",
      "BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary . We share the short term objective, cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas, and the long term objective, peace and stability in the region. In fact, we will welcome any further efforts led by the U.S. to implement the Abraham Accord logics. And what we're doing now with this very significant conference that will take place in New York will pave the way for such accords. But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics, a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the- or create an off ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza. Now the terms, we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords, but in the meantime, inaction is not an option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out though and said the French students were removed because they're Jewish. Have you determined whether this was indeed an act of antisemitism?",
      "BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has- to express our- our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in- in France, and we've made the same request. We'll keep following this situation as it unravels",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So too- too early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating.",
      "BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point. We've taken action as- as soon as we got, you know, as we got notice of what was happening, we offered support on location through our embassy to this group. We then reached out to the- the airline company, to the Spanish authorities, and we're now following the results of these investigations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings, Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon, and the world won't know?",
      "BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing, and alongside Germany and the UK, we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority in close coordination with U.S. authorities in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant rollback of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things has changed. Still then, and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement. We now want a more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also it's the ballistic component, as well as the regional destabilization activities that Iran has been conducting, unless we- unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the UK will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted 10 years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment, and on banking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?",
      "BARROT: We've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We- we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran, after the 12 day war, to go back to a discussion with the U.S., and we'll keep pressing them to do so, because indeed, if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, thank you very much for your time this morning."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is one of those appropriators we were just speaking about with the budget director. You just heard everything he laid out. There were no specifics on when these clawbacks could be coming, but they're on the table. He says they don't want to shut down. He didn't seem to say they want, you know, a continuing resolution. Do you know what's coming?",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Not really. The one thing we know, and you asked Russ Vought about this, was he says that the process is too bipartisan right now, meaning that they want to use this process just to ram through the agenda and the overall agenda we saw when they passed the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill, which was beautiful for billionaires, but not really for anybody else, which is to provide tax cuts for very wealthy people at the expense of everybody else. And I do want to say Margaret, I heard him deny that that bill increased the deficit and debt. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office just said it increased our debt by 3.5 trillion before added interest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's using an accounting gimmick in regard to the benchmark.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: As- and Republicans have called out this accounting gimmick, so when--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And it was accepted--",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, they sort of unilaterally imposed it, it was not accepted by Democrats, and it was a departure from previous efforts. But you know, then they come back and they say that they want to cut these important programs, NIH and other things to reduce the deficit, when, in fact, what they're doing it for is to help try finance those tax cuts for very wealthy people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's just heading us towards pretty unchartered territory and very unclear whether we will be able to avoid a government shutdown. Democrats are going to be blamed if there's a shutdown, don't you think? I mean, how do you sidestep this?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN : We certainly don't want a government shutdown. And I think everybody has heard Russ Vought say that they want a less bipartisan process. What that tells me is they're willing just to use their powers to try to shut down the government if they don't get their way. And what's ironic about this Margaret is you have Russ Vought calling for these deep cuts to education NIH, when he has asked for an increase for his OMB budget. He asked for a 13% increase for his OMB budget. He's asked for more people to join the OMB staff, while he's talking about RIFing people at other departments, like the Department of yeah- getting rid of firing people at the Department of Veterans Affairs and other important priorities. So it's hard to take the OMB Director seriously when he says that they didn't increase the debt and when he says he wants to cut things except for his own budget and staff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if they do head towards a government shutdown, why would there be any benefit unless it is to prioritize funding certain agencies and de-prioritizing other agencies. Well, that goes back to the executive, doesn't it, that authority?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, that ultimately, though you need, for example, four Republican senators to stand behind what he's calling for. And what they've called for is sort of just a double cross on the process, right? That's what the so-called rescissions, is just a Washington name for double cross. They support one thing, one day, President even signs off, and then they come back and say they changed their mind. And what we're asking is for four Republican senators just to publicly declare that when they say they're going to fund the Veterans Affairs Department that they actually mean it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That they won't later agree to claw that money back.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Exactly",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. So one of the things the Trump administration is clear and did get clawbacks of is foreign assistance. However, there's an exception. In June, the administration announced it would give $30 million to this Israeli-backed organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the GHF, I know you're familiar with it. It delivers aid through armed military contractors who stand behind the Israeli military in four designated zones that Gazans then have to get themselves to in order to receive the aid. The State Department says they're sending this money. Have they?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: To my knowledge, they have, although we've asked for the details, we haven't gotten them. In fact, just today, I'm sending a letter to Secretary Rubio, signed with 20 of my colleagues, calling for more information, but also calling for defunding this. American taxpayers should not be spending one penny to fund this private organization backed by mercenaries and by the IDF that has become a death trap. Over 1000 people have died from being shot and killed as starving people crowd to try to get food at just these four sites.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The- just to be clear here, the State Department says they're going to send $30 million. Reuters had reported that there were documents they obtained showing 7 million had already been sent to these, what you call, armed mercenaries. But the Trump administration says this is the best way, this is the only way, to keep money- to keep food out of the hands of Hamas, which financially benefits off reselling it to desperate starving people. Is there another way to feed desperate starving people?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Yes. And this is a- a big lie, the claim that when the UN organizations were delivering food to Palestinians civilians, that it was being systematically diverted to Hamas. I want to say loudly and clearly, this is a big lie. Trump is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The systematic part of that.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: The systematic, but that is their claim. They claim that essentially, large amounts of aid are being diverted to Hamas. What we know now, from testimony of American officials, Cindy McCain, and just this week, high level Israeli military officials, is that there's no evidence to support that. AID, USAID, just released a report saying there's no evidence to support that. So what the Netanyahu government did was scrap a delivery system that was working at delivering food and assistance in favor of this other effort. That was a pretext, this claim that Hamas was systematically diverting food. The real goal of this other effort is to use food as a weapon of war and population control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a violation of international law.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Yes, it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a human rights abuse. Senator Lindsey Graham was on \"Meet the Press\" this morning, and I want to ask for your reaction to something he said, because he was very strong in his words. He said, because the ceasefire talks fell apart, Israel is reassessing. He said to expect a full military effort by Israel to take Gaza down, quote, \"like we did in Tokyo and Berlin. They're going to do in Gaza what we did in Tokyo and Berlin, take the place by force, start over again, present a better future.\" The United States is a huge supporter of the State of Israel. Is there anything that could prevent what he says is about to happen?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, the United States should make very clear that it's unacceptable to use U.S. weapons to target or indiscriminately fire on civilians and civilian infrastructure. So--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because this sounds like an occupation.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, we also know, just this week, members of the Netanyahu coalition, in fact, government ministers, called for essentially erasing Gaza, and they said, it will become a Jewish state, statelet. And part of- so- this was one of the--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Netanyahu did say he didn't agree with his statement.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, here's the problem though, Margaret, we continually see that Netanyahu, at the end of the day, does cater to his most far right wing of his- of his government, people like Ben Gvir, people like Smotrich. That is what has allowed him to stay in power, and so at the end of the day, he takes the most extreme positions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\" Stay with us."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, welcome to 'Face The Nation.'",
      "DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET RUSSELL VOUGHT: Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much to get to with you. Let's start on what's going on with the Federal Reserve. If you take the president at his word, he does not intend to fire the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell- though he's still criticizing him. What is the President seeking in a successor when his term ends in May 2026?",
      "VOUGHT: Well, I think he's looking for a chairman that's not continually too late to the developments in the economic marketplace. And I think what we've seen with Chairman Powell, he was very late in the Biden administration to raise rates, to articulate the concern with regard to the Biden administration's spending. We all knew on the outside- even Larry Summers knew that we were going to have an issue with regard to inflation. And we saw, you know, recent, historical inflationary levels that we hadn't seen before. And now he is too late to lower inflation rates and so that is the kind of thing that we want to see in the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. And one of the reasons why is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --More of a focus on inflation?",
      "VOUGHT: --want an ability to recognize the developments in the economic marketplace. In this case, we want to be able to see lower rates and to have an ability to get the economy going. And one of the things we saw with Powell is that one of the reasons he was so late was because he didn't understand that inflation is largely a monetary phenomenon. He kept saying that inflation was transitory. He didn't tackle the problem, and now he's, again, too late, and you marry that with fiscal mismanagement at the Fed. It's a huge problem that we're trying to raise the country's awareness level with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as you know, the Fed is structured in a way where he doesn't have unilateral control. There's a governing board. Others weigh in. You did work on Project 2025, and we went back and looked at what they said in there about the Fed. As people may know, that's a Heritage Foundation product that got a lot of scrutiny during the campaign. the chapter on the Fed called for Congress to overhaul the Fed's focus and powers. Is that what you're looking to do in 2026?",
      "VOUGHT: I don't even know what that chapter says. All I know, in terms of the President, the President has run on an agenda. He's been very clear about that. All that we're doing is- in this administration is running on- is implementing his agenda.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't want to overhaul the Fed?",
      "VOUGHT: We want an economic system that works for the American people, that includes the Fed. And the President has been very clear that all he's asking from the Fed is lower interest rates, because he thinks it's important. When you look at across the across the globe, and you have countries lowering rates, and yet we don't see that in this country, given all of the positive economic indicators that we're seeing. And then we have fiscal mismanagement at the Fed with regard to this building renovation that I'm sure you will ask me about. Those are the kinds of things that we want to see from the Fed. This is not part of an existential issue with regard to the Federal Reserve.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed is indicating that they are trending towards a rate cut, though probably not as soon as this week. We mentioned those renovations at the top of the program, but I do want to ask about spending, or lack thereof, that the Trump administration is trying to direct. The White House said they will actually release the remaining $5 billion in education, funds that had been withheld from public schools until recently. There were 10 Republican senators very worried about this, and came out and said, your claim that the money goes to radical left wing programs was wrong. What changed your mind? What made you release this money?",
      "VOUGHT: Well, we had been going through a programmatic review with these funds. These are programs that, as an administration, we don't support. We've called for the elimination of them in the President's budget for precisely the reasons of which they flow to often left wing organizations. Thankfully, the President came into office, put an executive order that said it can't- these funds can't go to these types of initiatives. I'll just give you one example, English language acquisition was flowing to the New York school public education system to go into illegal immigration advocacy organizations. Preschool development grants doesn't actually go to preschoolers. It goes to the curriculum for putting CRT into the school system for people as young- children as young as four years old.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these senators said it goes to adult learners working to gain employment skills and after school programs.",
      "VOUGHT: And what we--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you deemed it is necessary?",
      "VOUGHT: We believe that it's important to get the money out right now, but we have taken an extended time frame to be able to make sure it doesn't go to the types of things that we saw under the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, you know, Senator Lindsey Graham told the Washington Post, the administration is looking at considering clawbacks from the Department of Education. This, you know, rescissions process. Is that the plan? Are you seeking to claw back education funds in a rescissions package? And if so, when are you sending that up?",
      "VOUGHT: We may be, we're always looking at potential rescission options. This is an- this is a set of funding that we wanted to make sure it got out. We did our programmatic review. We wanted to make sure it got out before the school year, even though it's multi-year funding. This is not funding that would expire at the end of this year. We are looking to do rescissions package. We're always gauging the extent to which the Congress is willing to participate in that process, and we're- be looking at a lot of different options along those lines, but certainly have nothing to announce here today. But we're thrilled that we had the first rescissions package in decades, and we've got the process moving again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no rescissions package before September?",
      "VOUGHT: Not here to say that. We're looking at all of our options, we will look at it and assess where the Hill is, what are the particular funding opportunities that we have, but nothing that we're going to announce today,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because some of the funds that do expire in September have also been held up on the health front. Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, 13 other Republicans, came out with a letter saying that you've been slow in releasing funds for the National Institute of Health for research into cardiovascular disease, cancer. Are those funds going to be released?",
      "VOUGHT: Again, we're going through the same process with the NIH that we did with the education. I mean--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's a time cost here.",
      "VOUGHT: --$2 million for injecting dogs with cocaine that the NIH spent money on, $75,000 for Harvard to study blowing lizards off of trees with leaf blowers. That's the kind of waste that we've seen at the NIH. And that's not even getting to the extent to which the NIH was weaponized against the American people over the last several years, with regard to funding gain of function research that caused the pandemic. We have a- we have an agency that needs dramatic overhaul. Thankfully, we have a great new head of it, but we're going to have to go line by line to make sure the NIH is funded properly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to release the cancer funding research? And the cardiovascular disease research funding?",
      "VOUGHT: We're going to continue- we're going to continue to go to the same process that we have gone through with regard to the Department of Education, that every one of these agencies--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before September, that money will be released?",
      "VOUGHT: --and we will release that funding when we are done with that review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, there's concern that you're withholding the money, hoping it just won't be spent. I mean, if you look at the White House budget, it does call for a 26% cut to HHS, $18 billion cut to NIH. Is this just a backdoor way to make those cuts happen?",
      "VOUGHT: Well, I don't want to speak to any specific program with regard to what we might do with regard to rescissions throughout the end of this fiscal year, but we certainly recognize that we have the ability and the executive tools to fund less than what Congress appropriated, and to use the tools that the Impoundment Control Act, a bill we're not- a law that we're not entirely thrilled with, gives us to- to send up rescissions towards the end of the fiscal year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So just for our viewers, the Impoundment Control Act is the legal mechanism for the President to use to delay or avoid spending funds appropriated by Congress. You seem to want to have an argument, or Democrats think you want to have an argument, over the power of the purse and who holds it. Do you want that to go to the Supreme Court?",
      "VOUGHT: Well, look, for 200 years, presidents have the ability to spend less than the congressional appropriations. No one would ever dispute, and our founders didn't dispute that Congress has the ability to set the appropriation ceiling. But 200 years of presidents, up until the 1970s had the ability to spend less, if they could find efficiencies, or if they could find waste that an agency was doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- That sounds like a yes?--",
      "VOUGHT:-- We lost that ability in the 1970s. The president ran on restoring that funding authority to the presidency, and it's vital. If you look at when we started to lose control fiscally, it was right around the time of the 1970s.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, many senators, Republican senators, are very uncomfortable with the tactics that you are using. Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins, that chair of the appropriations committee that is really running this- this funding process. And Senator Collins said you're pushing the limits of what the executive can do without the consent of the- of the legislative branch. You need to work with her to get your budget through. And in fact, you need to also be able to get Democrats on board to get to that 60-vote threshold to pass any kind of government funding to avoid a government shutdown at the end of September.",
      "VOUGHT: I have a great relationship with Senator Collins. I appreciate the work she does. She is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, so obviously we're going to have differences of opinion as to the extent to which these tools should be used. I mean, she had concerns with the rescissions package. The rescissions package was a vote that Congress had to make these cuts permanent--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Under- on a party line vote, she says, you want to go do these clawbacks. You do it through regular order, and you can put- you can put rescissions into an appropriations bill--",
      "VOUGHT: --But that was in fact, under regular order. That's the challenge, is the appropriators want to use all the rescissions, they want to put them in their bills, and then they want to spend higher on other programs. We act- we're $37 trillion in debt, Margaret. We actually need to reduce the deficit and have a dollar of cut go to $1 a deficit reduction. That's not what the appropriators want, and it's not news that the Trump administration is going to bring a paradigm shift to this town in terms of the business of spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You would acknowledge that you just added to the debt and to the deficit with this--",
      "VOUGHT: -- No, I would not acknowledge that. We reduced--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- The spending and tax bill that just passed?",
      "VOUGHT: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Where you lifted the debt ceiling.",
      "VOUGHT: The debt ceiling is an extension of the cap on what's needed to pay your previous bills. In terms of the bill itself, it is $400 billion in deficit reduction, $1.5 trillion in mandatory savings reforms, the biggest we've seen in history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to make sure I get to the rest of this before I let you go here, because we're running out of time. You said, a few weeks ago, that the appropriations process needs to be less bipartisan. You only have 53 Republicans. You do need Democrats to get on board, here. Is saying something like that intended to undermine negotiations? Do you actually want a government shutdown?",
      "VOUGHT: No, of course not. We want to extend the funding at the end of this fiscal year. We understand, from a math perspective, we're going to need Democrats to do that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what does less bipartisan mean?",
      "VOUGHT: Well, Margaret, the whole week, the Democrats were making the argument that if you pass the rescission bill, that you were undermining the bipartisan appropriations process. So, if Brian Schatz and every other appropriator is making that argument for a week--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee is who said that--",
      "VOUGHT: --you have to be able to respond and say, if you're going to call a rescissions package that you told us during the month of January and February that we should use to do less spending, if you're going to say that is undermining the bipartisan appropriations process, then maybe we should have a conversation about that. That is all it was meant to convey.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, the alternative to this process is another continuing resolution, these stop-gap measures. Are you open to that, because that would lock in Biden-era funding? What is your alternative here? If you want a less bipartisan process, how do you solve for this? Because it sounds like you're laying the predicate for a shutdown.",
      "VOUGHT: We are not laying the predicate for a shutdown. We are laying the predicate for the fact that the only thing that has worked in this town- the bipartisan appropriations process is broken. It leads to omnibus bills. We want to prevent an omnibus bill, and all options are on the table to be able to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All options are on the table?",
      "VOUGHT: We need an appropriations process that functions. We're going to go through the process. We're going to work with them, and we're going to do everything we possibly can to use that process to have cheaper results for the American taxpayer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm told we're out of time. Russell Vought, thank you for your time today."

    "story": [
      "Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought said his office is considering more options to claw back funding approved by Congress and isn't ruling out sending more bills to lawmakers with further cuts before September.",
      "Vought confirmed on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that \"we are looking to do [a] rescissions package\" to take back some funding from the Education Department. A rescissions bill is the president's request to rescind funding already appropriated by Congress. Last week, President Trump signed a bill clawing back foreign aid, NPR and PBS funding, becoming the first president in decades to receive approval for such a measure.",
      "\"We're thrilled that we had the first rescissions package in decades, and we've got the process moving again,\" Vought said of the $10 billion clawback. Asked to confirm there'd be no rescissions package before September, as Congress attempts to fund the government and head off a shutdown, Vought responded, \"Not here to say that. We're looking at all of our options, we will look at it and assess where the Hill is, what are the particular funding opportunities that we have?\"",
      "Asked about National Institutes of Health funding for research into heart disease and cancer that has yet to be released, Vought replied, \"We're going through the same process with the NIH that we did with the education.\" He alleged NIH had wasted funds, claiming \"$2 million for injecting dogs with cocaine that the NIH spent money on, $75,000 for Harvard to study blowing lizards off of trees with leaf blowers.\" He vowed to go \"line by line to make sure the NIH is funded properly\" and said funding would be released \"when we are done with that review.\"",
      "Vought's use of rescissions measures to amend government spending is seen by Democrats and some Republicans as a backdoor method of infringing on Congress' constitutional power of the purse.",
      "\"Rescissions is just a Washington name for double cross,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, also on \"Face the Nation,\" said after Vought's interview on the program. \"They support one thing one day \u2014 the president even signs off \u2014 and then they come back and say they change their mind.\"",
      "But the OMB director argued, \"We have the ability and the executive tools to fund less than what Congress appropriated\" under the Impoundment Control Act, which enables the president to delay spending funds appropriated by Congress, and he didn't rule out a legal battle over the executive branch's authority to revise lawmakers' spending downward, if it \"could find waste\" by an agency.",
      "Vought has also caused GOP Senate Majority Leader John Thune some headaches with a comment he made Thursday suggesting the appropriations process must be \"less bipartisan.\" But this put Thune in a bind as he oversees negotiations to avoid a government shutdown in October, since Republicans hold a slim majority of 53 - 47 in the Senate, and most legislation must reach a 60-vote threshold.",
      "\"It's going to take 60 to fund the government,\" Thune said in response to Vought's remark, and he added, \"we plan to move [appropriations] bills that will have cooperation from the Democrats.\"",
      "Van Hollen said it was ironic that Vought is \"calling for these deep cuts to education, NIH, when he has asked for an increase for his OMB budget.\" And referring to reduction-in-force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 staff cuts the administration wants across the government, Van Hollen added, \"He asked for a 13% increase for his OMB budget. He's asked for more people to join the OMB staff while he's talking about RIF-ing people at other departments.\"",
      "The Maryland senator said that Democratic senators, as they negotiate funding government operations, are \"asking for four Republican senators just to publicly declare that when they say they're gonna fund the Veterans Affairs Department, that they actually mean it.\""

    "story": [
      "A group of Democratic senators led by Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is urging the Trump administration to suspend American financial support for the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private food distribution organization that has been heavily criticized for the way it delivers food aid to Gazans and because so many have been killed trying to reach its distribution sites.",
      "The U.S. and Israel have advocated for the recently established GHF to replace the United Nations, which has built an extensive network of humanitarian workers inside Gaza over decades. Israel accuses the U.N. of bias and collusion with Hamas.",
      "In a letter sent to Secretary of State Marco Rubio Sunday, the 21 senators expressed \"grave\" concerns about \"the U.S. role in and financial support for the troubled GHF.\"",
      "\"We urge you to immediately cease all U.S. funding for GHF and resume support for the existing UN-led aid coordination mechanisms with enhanced oversight to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches civilians in need,\" the letter reads.",
      "The U.N. warns that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing increasingly dire as more Palestinians are in danger of starvation after a months-long Israeli blockade, and recent military operations complicated humanitarian efforts to help. The IDF claims there is no starvation.",
      "Van Hollen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as well as the powerful Appropriations Committee, told CBS News \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday, \"American taxpayers should not be spending one penny to fund this private organization backed by mercenaries and by the IDF that has become a death trap,\" noting that scores of Gazans were shot and killed as starving people crowded the GHF sites to obtain food.",
      "The letter focuses on a $30 million pledge from the State Department, announced last month, and on GHF's operations, particularly its use of armed contractors who stand behind IDF soldiers at food distribution sites in four designated military zones. Starving Gazans must travel to those areas, which is difficult for those too weak to move.",
      "\"Blurring the lines between delivery of aid and security operations shatters well-established norms that have governed distribution of humanitarian aid since the ratification of the Geneva Conventions in 1949,\" the letter says.",
      "U.S. allies have also been critical of the tactics used by the U.S. and Israeli-backed GHF.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot told Margaret Brennan Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" that Gaza is on the \"brink of food catastrophe\" and that France expects \"the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused [a] bloodbath in humanitarian health distribution lines in Gaza.\"",
      "U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Friday that a thousand Palestinians have been killed trying to access food since May 27.",
      "\"We hold video calls with our own humanitarians who are starving before our eyes,\" Guterres said. \"We will continue to speak out at every opportunity. But words don't feed hungry children.\"",
      "The U.N. human rights office said 1,054 people were killed while trying to obtain food since late May, and of those, 766 were killed while trying to reach sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The others were killed when gunfire erupted around U.N. convoys or aid sites.",
      "The group of senators led by Van Hollen are seeking answers about whether necessary oversight is being bypassed to benefit the GHF. Their letter cites public reports that the Trump administration authorized the funds under a \"priority directive,\" which meant it could avoid \"a comprehensive audit that is usually required for groups receiving USAID grants for the first time.\"",
      "The senators want to see the GHF's \"complete funding application and all supporting documentation\" and demand to know whether any statutory and regulatory requirements were waived.",
      "They also asked Rubio about the procurement mechanism that resulted in the $30 million in funding, and they want to know who signed the agreement, who might be liable for compliance violations and whether officials were aware of potential concerns raised by USAID about \"GHF's ability to protect Palestinians while delivering food aid.\"",
      "The State Department has not responded to a CBS News request for comment about the senators' letter. A department spokesperson said Friday that the funding has been allocated, but it has not yet been disbursed to GHF.",
      "On Saturday, amid international outcry, the Israel Defense Force began airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza and said it would establish humanitarian corridors to \"enable the safe movement of UN convoys delivering food and medicine to the population.\"",
      "The U.N. has said the airdrops are insufficient. Past airdrops have fallen on Gazans and killed them. Now the approximately 2 million people live in Gaza and have been herded into an even more limited zone that lacks extensive open space where air-dropped pallets can land.",
      "Israel's announcement came after extensive international outcry at images of starving children, and reports of death. Leaders in Europe, including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Fredreich Merz, coordinated Saturday by phone. A readout of the call released by the UK said the three leaders said the situation in Gaza is \"appalling\" and \"emphasized the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire, for Israel to lift all restrictions on aid and urgently provide those suffering in Gaza with the food they so desperately need.\"",
      "On Friday, two Jordanian officials said they were considering airdrops and the United Arab Emirates sent a 7,000-ton aid ship to Gaza's shores. But it has not been determined who will distribute the food once it arrives.",
      "The GHF says it has distributed more than 91 million meals to Gazans, but there have been almost daily reports of civilians being injured or killed as they try to reach one of the group's four distribution hubs, all located in southern Gaza.",
      "In an interview with BBC News this week, Anthony Aguliar, a U.S. Army veteran and former contractor for GHF, detailed what he says he saw on the ground behind IDF lines during humanitarian aid distribution, calling the operation \"amateur.\"",
      "\"I witnessed the Israeli Defense Forces shooting at the crowds of Palestinians. I witnessed the Israeli Defense Forces firing a main gun tank round from the Merkava tank into a crowd of people,\" Aguilar said. \"In my most frank assessment, I would say that they're criminal. In my entire career, I have never witnessed the level of brutality and use of indiscriminate and unnecessary force against a civilian population, an unarmed, starving population.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the GHF called Aguilar's claims \"materially false\" and said he had been terminated from his position for \"misconduct.\"",
      "The group has also been criticized by the U.N., which said GHF's tactics are neither adequate nor safe and make it more difficult for Gazans too weak to travel to military zones to secure food.",
      "Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, which provides support for Palestinian refugees, condemned the GHF in June, calling it \"an abomination\" and \"a death trap costing more lives than it saves.\"",
      "As the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorated further this week, the GHF and U.N. groups continued to blame each other.",
      "In several public statements and social media posts last week, GHF said the responsibility for the mass starvation lies with the U.N. for allowing their full aid trucks inside Gaza to sit untouched and undistributed.",
      "\"The U.N. cannot deliver this humanitarian aid to the people who need it most, and I'm not sure what the reason is,\" said GHF spokesperson Chapin Fay in a video posted to X, which showed him standing in front of U.N. aid trucks. \"Whether it's looters, safety or whether they're playing politics, it just doesn't matter. The people of Gaza deserve better.\"",
      "The executive chairman of GHF, Reverend Johnnie Moore, in an interview with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro this week accused the U.N. of \"playing politics with people's lives.\"",
      "\"They're actually basically a willful participant on the Hamas side of the negotiating table in the ceasefire negotiations, by refusing to distribute aid and spreading this narrative around the world that the people of Gaza are going to starve if Hamas doesn't, in effect, get its demands at the negotiating table,\" Moore said.",
      "The U.N. World Food Programme says hundreds of aid trucks are ready to move, but the approval needed from the Israeli military to transport and distribute that aid is not coming quickly enough. In a statement Friday, they said just over half of their requests to collect cargo were approved and convoys were typically delayed, sometimes up to nearly two days, awaiting permission to travel within Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, a UNICEF spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that their supplies of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food or RUTF \u2014 used for treating severely acutely malnourished children \u2014 is expected to run out in mid-August if more is not allowed into Gaza.",
      "\"We are now facing a dire situation that we are running out of therapeutic supplies,\" said Salim Oweis, a spokesperson for UNICEF in Amman, Jordan. \"That's really dangerous for children as they face hunger and malnutrition at the moment,\" he added.",
      "Oweis said UNICEF had only enough RUTF left to treat 3,000 children. In the first two weeks of July alone, UNICEF treated 5,000 children facing acute malnutrition in Gaza.",
      "The UNICEF spokesperson said the agency is unaware of whether GHF is distributing this type of specialized food and emphasized that it must be given to children after they are assessed by professional health workers to be suffering from acute malnutrition. GHF did not respond to CBS News when asked if the foundation also distributes specialized high-nutrient food for acutely malnourished children.",

    "story": [
      "House Democrats are seeking a copy of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged 2003 \"birthday book\" that is said to include a \"bawdy\" letter signed by President Trump to the convicted sex offender.",
      "In a letter to the representatives of Epstein's estate on Friday, Rep. Ro Khanna and House Oversight Ranking Democrat Rep. Robert Garcia, both of California, said the request comes amid Mr. Trump's \"desperate attempts to quell public interest in the release of files\" related to the disgraced financier.",
      "\"Recent public reporting indicates that the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein is in possession of a document commonly referred to as 'the birthday book,' compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell in 2003 in celebration of Mr. Epstein's 50th birthday, which has clear relevance to this case,\" they wrote in a letter.",
      "\"The book is relevant for ongoing congressional oversight of the Department of Justice's handling of the Epstein investigation and prosecution, as well as the Trump Administration's decision to declassify and release only a handful of documents from its Epstein files while withholding others from the public,\" the letter stated.",
      "The Democratic lawmakers requested a \"complete, unredacted copy\" of the alleged birthday book no later than Aug. 10. The \u00a0House Oversight Committee is pursuing its own inquiry into the Epstein saga and has separately issued a subpoena for Maxwell, the financier's imprisoned accomplice and former girlfriend, to sit for a deposition the following day, on Aug. 11.",
      "Epstein, 66, who leveraged his wealth to make connections with many high-profile figures in the U.S. and abroad, was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on Aug. 10, 2019, while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal published a story\u00a0that claimed a letter signed by Mr. Trump was included in the book along with letters from other friends and acquaintances of Epstein. The president has denied the report, calling the letter a \"FAKE.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump filed a libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, the reporters who wrote the story, and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, alleging the paper's claims were \"false, defamatory, unsubstantiated, and disparaging.\" The lawsuit, which also accuses the Journal of \"clear journalistic failures,\" includes two counts of defamation, each seeking at least $10 billion.",
      "A Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement: \"We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has previously acknowledged a past friendship with Epstein years ago but has said they had a \"falling out.\"",
      "The Trump administration has been facing increased pressure to disclose\u00a0more details on Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in a Florida state court in 2008 under a controversial plea deal that allowed him to serve only 13 months in jail. Last week, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Epstein. One of the Justice Department's requests to unseal grand jury transcripts has been\u00a0denied.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump came after the Justice Department and FBI\u00a0released a memo\u00a0stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release much more information on Epstein.",
      "Meanwhile, Todd Blanche, the second-highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell\u00a0at the U.S. attorney's office in Tallahassee, Florida, to discuss Epstein over 1 \u00bd days of interviews. Her lawyer said, \"She didn't hold anything back.\"",
      "Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence at a low-security federal prison in Tallahassee after being convicted three years ago of helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump ducked questions about a possible pardon for Maxwell, telling reporters after landing in Scotland, \"I don't know anything about the conversation\" between Maxwell and Blanche.",

      "\"It was arbitrary, unfair,\" Pappas told CBS News of his firing. \"And it's an attack on the rule of law. It's an attack on judges.\"",
      "Pappas served as an immigration judge in Boston until this week, overseeing more than 2,000 cases during his two years on the bench. Peyton led Chicago's immigration court for nearly nine years, hearing thousands of cases until she was abruptly fired over the 4th of July weekend.",

      "\"They told me: Grant the motions to dismiss,\" Pappas said. \"This is when ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) was roaming the courthouses. Because if we dismissed the case, that person that responded then leaves the court vulnerable to immediate apprehension and expedited removal.\"",

      "The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, the union that represents immigration court judges, reports that since the Trump Administration took office, more than 100 immigration\u00a0 judges have either been fired, transferred, or have taken retirement offers.",

      "In defending its immigration crackdown, the White House has repeatedly argued that undocumented immigrants are in the U.S. illegally. And in May, the Trump administration began an effort to halt the immigration court cases of certain migrants in order to fast-track their deportation process, government officials and attorneys told CBS News at the time. Espinoza counters that the court system exists to ensure the law is followed, and attempts to circumvent it could prove to be a slippery slope.",
      "\"That's why they're in proceedings in court,\" Espinoza said of the immigrants. \"There is law that we're applying, and they might have to go, and they might not...Today it's them, it's immigrants. What about tomorrow? Who's going to get due process denied next.\"",
      "\"If you're attacking the very judges that adjudicate cases, there's not going to be a rule of law. That should concern everybody, not just immigrants, but U.S. citizens.\"",

      "House Republicans on Tuesday advanced a measure that would rename the Kennedy Center for the Performing\u00a0Arts' opera house after first lady Melania Trump \u2014 as President Trump and his allies boost their influence over the D.C. cultural institution.",
      "The proposed renaming was folded into an amendment to a bill that would set fiscal year 2026 funding levels for the Interior Department and several other federal agencies, including the Kennedy Center. The amendment \u2014 and the bill itself \u2014 were advanced by the House Appropriations Committee in a hearing Tuesday.",
      "The renaming was authored by Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, who pointed to the first lady's role as honorary chair of the Kennedy Center board.",
      "The renaming was not requested by the Trump administration, Simpson's communications director Lexi Hamel told CBS News in an email.",
      "\"Naming a theater after her is an excellent way to recognize her appreciation for the arts,\" Simpson, who chairs the Appropriations Committee's Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Subcommittee, wrote in a statement.",
      "The subcommittee's top Democrat, Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, criticized the renaming idea in Tuesday's hearing and said she was surprised to learn about it.",
      "\"The Republicans snuck in, I think, something that's slightly divisive, which is renaming one section of the Kennedy Center after a family member of this administration,\" she said.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The nameplate over the opera house \u2014 which seats nearly 2,400 people and is one of several spaces in the Kennedy Center \u2014 is unlikely to change any time soon. Spending bills like the one advanced Tuesday generally need 60 votes to pass the Senate, meaning even if it makes it through the full House intact, several Senate Democrats will need to vote for it. Lawmakers also have until the end of September to pass funding measures in order to avert the possibility of a potential partial government shutdown.",
      "But the idea follows a push by Mr. Trump to assert more control over the Kennedy Center.",
      "Weeks after retaking office, Mr. Trump removed some members of the cultural institution's board of trustees and stocked the board with a range of Trump allies \u2014 including Attorney General Pam Bondi and country singer Lee Greenwood. Mr. Trump now serves as chairman of the Kennedy Center board, and his ally Richard Grenell, who also serves as the White House envoy for special missions, is the center's president.",
      "The moves were partially intended to pivot the Kennedy Center away from what the president views as \"woke culture,\" a source told CBS News earlier this year. Mr. Trump has publicly criticized some of the performances hosted by the center.",
      "\"NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA \u2014 ONLY THE BEST,\" he wrote on Truth Social in February.",
      "The moves have drawn criticism, with the producers of musical megahit \"Hamilton\" calling off a slate of performances next year due to what it called \"a new spirit of partisanship.\" Last month, the president and first lady attended a performance of \"Les Miserables\" at the Kennedy Center, drawing a mixture of cheers and boos.",
      "Pingree criticized Republicans' handling of the Kennedy Center in Tuesday's hearing, arguing the party has given the president \"carte blanche\" over the cultural center. She pointed to the $256.7 million appropriated for the Kennedy Center over the next four years in the Trump-backed \"big, beautiful bill\" that passed earlier this month.",
      "Simpson responded Tuesday, \"Let me see if I got this straight: So, we're upset that we didn't fund the arts, but we're upset that we did fund the arts?\"",

    "summary": "In a new survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends.",
    "story": [
      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\"Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,\" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \"I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\"",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you.\"",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to\u00a0a new study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \"digital friends,\" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are \"everywhere in teens' lives.\"",
      "Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships.",
      "\"Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,\" Steyer said. \"They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings.\"",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,\" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \"When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\"",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \"AI companion\" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\"That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\" said Nair. \"It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\"",
      "How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",
      "\"It's the new addiction,\" Nair added. \"That's how I see it.\"",

      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",
      "Tea declined to comment for this article.",
      "Safety in numbers",
      "To be sure, most of the features that Tea offers already exist. Social media forums, such as the Facebook group called \"Are we dating the same guy?,\" also let women compare notes about their dates in a community forum. The main difference: scale. Tea has more than 1.6 million users, according to its website.",
      "\"What this app seems to be doing is centralizing all that into one very large community,\" Doug Zytko, an associate professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who researches human-computer interactions for safety, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly. Tea confirmed to CBS News that its app was hacked Friday morning, with bad actors accessing a data storage system containing information, including selfies, that members had uploaded prior to February 2024.",
      "Additionally, hackers accessed almost 60,000 images from posts, plus comments and direct messages, the company said.",
      "\"Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,\" the company said in a statement, noting that it is investigating the incident. \"At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Automated license plate reader technology is used by law enforcement agencies in communities across the U.S. \u2014 but the systems sometimes get things wrong.",
    "story": [
      "In 2018, Brian Hofer and his younger brother were driving to visit their parents for Thanksgiving. It should have been a routine trip.",
      "But that evening they found themselves held at gunpoint by a group of law enforcement officers.",
      "The incident was the result of technology gone wrong. Hofer's vehicle had been flagged as stolen by an Automated License Plate Reader \u2014 ALPR \u2014 system. When he drove by, the reader alerted authorities.",
      "\"Your life definitely is different after you have guns pointed at you,\" he said.",
      "This incident is one of over a dozen cases verified by CBS News during a six-month investigation into incidents of wrongful stops and even several instances of ALPR technology being abused.",
      "The consequences of ALPR errors can range from the inconvenient \u2014 such as mistaken toll booth charges \u2014 to the potentially dangerous, such as Hofer's armed detainment. In some instances the technology was improperly used by authorities, such as in Kansas, where law enforcement officers used license plate reader systems to stalk former partners in two separate incidents.",
      "The rise of ALPR systems",
      "In use since at least the\u00a0late 1990s, automated license plate reader systems have advanced quickly in recent years. They now marry high-speed, high-resolution cameras with artificial intelligence to scan every license plate passing through a designated field of vision. The data is then compared against license plate numbers in databases.",
      "Thousands of agencies use these systems daily to scan plates in real time and identify potential matches. Departments use ALPRs as a crime-fighting tool to gather evidence for investigations and reduce crime as well as for traffic compliance.",
      "According to a survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, every police department overseeing more than 1 million citizens reported using the technology, as did 90% of sheriff's offices with 500 or more sworn deputies.",
      "Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the technology has allowed them to do their job more efficiently and has helped solve crimes ranging from stolen vehicles to missing persons cases.",
      "Pat Yoes, the national president of The National Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of hundreds of thousands of sworn law enforcement officers, said in an emailed statement to CBS News that ALPRs are \"extraordinarily important in cases where there is an immediate threat to life or safety, as in an abduction or an armed threat driving to a target,\" adding that the information can be valuable in generating leads and closing cases.",
      "He said transparency is key. \"The community should be made aware of the new technology, how it's used in the field, how it contributes to public safety, and how it addresses any privacy concerns,\" he said in the statement. \"Technology like ALPRs is a valuable tool for many law enforcement agencies to make their communities safer.\"",
      "The rise of ALPR systems comes as law enforcement agencies across the country face staffing and recruiting challenges. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional association, found that U.S. agencies are operating at a nearly 10% staffing deficit. ALPR technology is one way to help fill this gap in manpower.",
      "Why license plate readers make errors \u2014 what we found",
      "License plate reader errors may occur for a variety of reasons. In some cases, letters or numbers are interpreted incorrectly by the Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, software. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, common issues including glare or misaligned cameras could impact accuracy. CBS News found that mistakes are often due to a mix of machine and human or administrative errors.",
      "In Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico, a 12-year-old was handcuffed after an ALPR camera misread the last number of a license plate on a vehicle driven by her older sister as a \"7\" instead of the \"2\" it actually ended with, according to a lawsuit filed against the city. A month later, in a separate incident, a 17-year-old honors student was held at gunpoint in Espa\u00f1ola on his way home from school after officers mistook his vehicle for one associated with an individual who was being sought in connection with a string of armed robberies.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, in 2020, a mother and her family, including her 6-year-old daughter, were pulled over at gunpoint and forced to lie face down on hot pavement. Again, ALPR technology was central to the stop. Police mistakenly flagged their Colorado license plate as matching that of a completely different vehicle from a different state \u2014 a stolen motorcycle registered in Montana. The incident, captured on video and widely condemned, led to a $1.9 million settlement from the city in 2024.",
      "Privacy and accuracy concerns",
      "The ACLU warns ALPR cameras could infringe on civil rights and violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by encouraging unreasonable searches. Despite widespread use, there is no federal legislative framework for ALPR use.",
      "Hofer, who has been involved in privacy advocacy for over a decade, is now the executive director of Secure Justice, an organization that aims to reduce government and corporate overreach. He says manual verification is necessary to see whether ALPR \"hits,\" or matches, are accurate. Even so, he said, such checks are insufficient because data errors could cause a plate to \"match\" an incorrect entry in a database.",
      "\"There are billions of scans a day in America. If there's even just a 10% error rate, that means there are so many opportunities for abuse to happen,\" Hofer said.",
      "Some concerned citizens are taking action. Last year, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, and in Illinois, two residents have sued the Illinois State Police over ALPR systems, arguing that their use violates Fourth Amendment rights. The latter case was dismissed without prejudice in April.",

      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",

      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",

      "\"We have to grow that baby and let that baby thrive,\" the president said. That means allowing some regulation, but also cutting red tape, he said.",
      "The president thanked companies present at the summit for investing in data centers and other projects, saying they'll create thousands of jobs.",
      "The Wednesday announcement is co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four technology investors and entrepreneurs who include Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar David Sacks.",
      "\"The goal here is for the United States to win the AI race,\" Sacks said during a press call with reporters Wednesday morning.",
      "The plan is backed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and will be carried out over the next six months to a year, according to Michael Kratsios, policy director of the OSTP.",
      "\"This is a watershed day for Trump to lay out the AI vision and make sure the U.S. stays ahead of China despite all the trade deal turmoil,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What is the AI Action Plan?",
      "The AI Action Plan focuses on accelerating AI innovation and building out AI infrastructure to ensure the U.S. leads in international \"AI diplomacy,\" according to Sacks, who laid out the plan's major pillars during Wednesday's call.",
      "That includes expediting the construction of large-scale data centers, which house servers, networking gear and other technology used to power artificial intelligence.",
      "Thousands of data centers are scattered around the U.S. Most are connected to the nation's power grid and rely on massive amounts of electricity to operate. The proliferation of AI data centers has been cited as one of the drivers of burgeoning energy costs.",
      "The number of data centers is only expected to grow as technology companies \u2014 including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI \u2014 ramp up construction to meet the nation's growing energy demand stemming from the emergence of AI.",
      "In addition to investments in data centers, the new White House plan also focuses on \"expediting and modernizing programs\" for semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, and updating the nation's electric grid to support the enormous energy demands of AI supercomputing, Kratsios said.",
      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",
      "To that end, Kratsios said the plan will update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with AI developers whose systems \"allow free speech expression to flourish.\"",
      "The plan also seeks to maintain the U.S.' edge in the global race for AI dominance as it competes with countries like China, which has moved quickly to expand its AI capabilities. A senior White House official said the report supports export controls to make sure \"that our most advanced technology doesn't get into the hands of [other] countries.\"",
      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",
      "DEI regulations within the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act \"burden the industry\" and \"slow down the delivery of critical projects,\" they said.",

      "\"We can confirm that Google DeepMind has reached the much-desired milestone, earning 35 out of a possible 42 points - a gold medal score,\" the U.S. tech giant cited IMO president Gregor Dolinar as saying. \"Their solutions were astonishing in many respects. IMO graders found them to be clear, precise and most of them easy to follow.\"",

      "U.S. ChatGPT maker OpenAI said its experimental reasoning model had also scored a gold-level 35 points on the test.",
      "The result \"achieved a longstanding grand challenge in AI\" at \"the world's most prestigious math competition,\" OpenAI researcher Alexander Wei said in a social media post.",
      "\"We evaluated our models on the 2025 IMO problems under the same rules as human contestants,\" he said. \"For each problem, three former IMO medalists independently graded the model's submitted proof.\"",
      "Google achieved a silver-medal score at last year's IMO in the city of Bath, in southwest England, solving four of the six problems.",
      "That took two to three days of computation \u2014 far longer than this year, when its Gemini model solved the problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, it said.",
      "The IMO said tech companies had \"privately tested closed-source AI models on this year's problems,\" the same ones faced by 641 competing students from 112 countries.",
      "\"It is very exciting to see progress in the mathematical capabilities of AI models,\" said IMO president Dolinar.",
      "Contest organizers could not verify how much computing power had been used by the AI models or whether there had been human involvement, he noted.",
      "In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes earlier this year, one of Google's leading AI researchers predicted that within just five to 10 years, computers would be made that have human-level cognitive abilities \u2014 a landmark known as \"artificial general intelligence.\"",
      "Google DeepMind CEO\u00a0Demis Hassabis predicted\u00a0that AI technology was on track to understand the world in nuanced ways, and to not only solve important problems, but even to develop a sense of imagination, within a decade, thanks to an increase in investment.",
      "\"It's moving incredibly fast,\" Hassabis said. \"I think we are on some kind of exponential curve of improvement. Of course, the success of the field in the last few years has attracted even more attention, more resources, more talent. So that's adding to the, to this exponential progress.\"",

    "story": [
      "When FBI agents arrived outside William Spearman's home in the quiet suburb of Madison, Alabama, in November 2022, they were prepared for danger.",
      "Their search warrant was so important to the bureau that it was approved by the FBI director himself. When the agents breached Spearman's door with tactical explosives, Spearman fought back, tussling with the agents as three of his handguns remained barely out of reach.\tThe FBI managed to handcuff and arrest Spearman, a high-value arrest, in what a top Justice Department official called \"one of the most successful\" prosecutions of its kind.",
      "Spearman went by the nickname \"Boss\" and was labeled by the Justice Department as \"one of the most significant\" purveyors of child sex abuse material in the world. His arrest in 2022, his guilty plea a year later and his eventual life sentence were part of an unprecedented takedown of a prodigious child abuse network.",
      "Spearman is one of at least 18 people convicted so far of leading and utilizing the dark web to share hundreds of thousands of unlawful sexually exploitative images of children.\tThe Justice Department calls the investigation and prosecutions Operation Grayskull; it helped secure those arrests and shutter four heavily trafficked dark web sites where violent and horrific images of child sexual abuse were traded and housed.",
      "The Operation Grayskull investigation launched in 2020, when law enforcement agents noticed a spike in traffic to a dark web site suspected of hosting child abuse material. The dark web child abuse sites eventually attracted more than 120,000 members, millions of files and at least 100,000 visits in a single day, according to an FBI official who spoke with CBS News.",
      "\"Even for prosecutors, it is difficult to understand how pervasive this is,\" said Matthew Galeotti, head of the Justice Department Criminal Division.",
      "\"Because it happens on the dark web, people aren't aware of it. It's extremely troubling,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Spearman's case has parallels to many of the others unearthed by Operation Grayskull. Spearman was accused of helping lead a dark web site with thousands of users and members.\tA sentencing memo submitted to the court said it was \"no wonder\" that he had tried to resist the FBI, rather than surrendering.",
      "\"The devices at his desk contained massive quantities of evidence proving that he was the lead administrator of Website A,\" the memo said. \"Unsurprisingly, the defendant's devices also contained an enormous collection of images and videos depicting the rape and abuse of children.\"",
      "Selwyn Rosenstein was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2022, for\u00a0 operating a dark website for unlawful exploitative images. Prosecutors said the platform \"was not simply a website; it was a large, active community of pedophiles and (abuse material) enthusiasts. And it existed in part because of the Defendant's criminal acts.\"",
      "Rosenstein possessed such a large quantity of abusive images, he needed to store some on a server he used to run his business, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Speaking from a second floor conference room at Justice Department headquarters in Washington last week, Galeotti told CBS News the members of these dark web child abuse sites often \"earn\" membership by paying a fee, \"helping moderate the site\" or contributing child abuse images or material.",
      "Galeotti said, \"We luckily have very sophisticated prosecutors and agents who work specifically on this kind of thing. These are people who have a more of a technical understanding.\"",
      "\"The defendants in this case, as sadistic as they may be, are somewhat sophisticated,\" and make use of encryption, he added.",
      "Operation Grayskull also secured the conviction of Matthew Garrell of Raleigh, North Carolina, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for operating on a dark web site for abuse material.",
      "\"Garrell engaged in an extremely complex and technologically sophisticated conspiracy that far exceeds the typical child-exploitation offenses,\" prosecutors said.",
      "They argued in a court filing that Garrell possessed a predator's \"handbook,\" with \"detailed instructions\" for grooming children for future abuse.",
      "The takedown of dark web leaders and users also included the convictions of men from Virginia, Maryland, Indiana, Texas, Washington, Arkansas, Michigan and Oklahoma.",
      "\"They were part of an online community of hundreds of thousands of people, with leadership roles rules and a common dedicated purpose\" said Chris Delzotto, an acting FBI deputy assistant director. Delzotto told CBS News, \"Few people would have envisioned how (child abuse materials) would permeate the internet, the way it has today.\"",
      "The federal investigation which uncovered and shuttered the first dark web site, also led to the closure of three others. Abbigail Beccaccio, an FBI unit chief, told CBS News. \"The leadership team that operated one of the sites also operated several of the others.\"",
      "The Justice Department is touting the shutdown of those sites as a victory to help deter future abuse or production of unlawful images. \"This is one of the most successful of all time,\" Galeotti said. \"We dismantled four websites that have not regenerated.\"",

      "\"Of course, I'm nervous and I probably should be preparing more, but this morning I actually went to the field, long tossed and kind of ran and did my workout, so I guess for me that was more important,\" Suzuki said Saturday through an interpreter on the eve of his enshrinement.",
      "Suzuki is the first Japanese player chosen for the Hall and fell one vote shy of becoming the second unanimous selection. He will be joined Sunday by CC Sabathia, a six-time All-Star who won the 2007 AL Cy Young Award, and relief pitcher Billy Wagner. Dave Parker, who died a month before he was to be inducted, and Dick Allen were honored posthumously. They were voted in by the classic era committee.",
      "MLB has been profoundly impacted by Japan since Suzuki's arrival in 2001. His induction coincided with the opening of an exhibit at the Hall on Thursday entitled Yakyu/Baseball: The Transpacific Exchange of the Game, which celebrates the ways Japanese and American baseball are interconnected. It honors not just Suzuki but also pitcher Hideo Nomoi and current two-way star Shohei Otani.",
      "As interconnected as the two countries are, Suzuki does not want Japanese baseball to become a carbon copy of MLB.",
      "\"I don't think Japan should copy what MLB does. I think Japanese baseball should be Japanese baseball and the way they do things, and MLB should be the way they are. I think they should be different and not the same,\" he said.",
      "Suzuki received 393 of 394 votes (99.7%) from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Sabathia was on 342 ballots (86.8%) and Wagner on 325 (82.5%), which was 29 votes more than the 296 needed for the required 75%.",
      "Suzuki joked about falling one vote shy of a unanimous induction, calling out the one writer who left him off the ballot. The ballots are secret, so it's not known who kept Suzuki off their list, but after the totals had been announced, Suzuki initially offered to have that writer over for dinner.",
      "\"Three thousand hits or 262 hits in one season are achievements recognized by the writers. Well, all but one of you,\" he said during his speech on Sunday. \"By the way, the offer for that writer to have dinner at my home has now expired.\"",
      "Only one player in the Hall's history has been voted in unanimously: legendary New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who received all 425 possible votes in 2019.",
      "Suzuki was a two-time AL batting champion and 10-time All-Star and Gold Glove outfielder, hitting .311 with 117 homers, 780 RBIs and 509 stolen bases with Seattle, the New York Yankees and Miami.",
      "He is perhaps the best contact hitter ever, with 1,278 hits in Nippon Professional Baseball and 3,089 in MLB, including a season-record 262 in 2004. His combined total of 4,367 exceeds Pete Rose's MLB record of 4,256.",
      "Suzuki visited the Hall seven times during his career, but this time is different.",
      "\"I had a purpose. I would come to the basement and look at some of the artifacts. This time around, though, I didn't come to have one purpose to see something. I just wanted to experience Cooperstown, take it all in. That's the difference this time around.",
      "\"This is the place where I'd come (during the season) and kind of cleanse myself and get a great feeling again,\" he said.",
      "For Sabathia, his induction represents a full-circle moment because his plaque will have him sporting a Yankees cap with the interlocking NY.",
      "A native of Vallejo, California, Sabathia \"thought I wanted to be close to home,\" but after \"pretending\" the Yankees didn't offer him a contract on the first day of free agency, his wife persuaded him to sign with the Bronx Bombers following an in-home meeting with general manager Brian Cashman.",
      "\"My wife was the one that said: 'You're trying to do all these different things, figure out all these contracts. You need to go where they want you. All you talk about is you want to win, be a winner and all these things. How can you not go to New York? That's the one place they try to win every single year.' When she put it that way, it was like I was born to be a Yankee,\" Sabathia said.",
      "\"And I think for the longest time I tried to run away from that because my father would always tell me I was going to play for the Yankees. He passed away when I was 23, so he wasn't there to tell me it was OK if I failed. I think I was scared to go there and fail. But it ended up being the best decision I ever made. I ran from that decision for a long time. I thought I wanted to play on the other coast, but I think I was born to play with the pinstripes.\"",
      "Suzuki and Sabathia were teammates for more than two seasons, which makes their induction extra special.",
      "\"It feels like we're teammates. Obviously, Ichi and I were rookies together. I always say he stole my Rookie of the Year award (in 2001) so it's great to be able to go in the HOF with him and Billy,\" Sabathia said.",
      "Sabathia went 251-161 with a 3.74 ERA and 3,093 strikeouts, third among left-handers behind Randy Johnson and Steve Carlton, during 19 seasons with Cleveland, Milwaukee and the Yankees.",
      "While Sabathia and Suzuki were elected in their first appearance on the ballot, Wagner made it on his 10th and final try.",

      "Wallace risked everything by staying on the track, then beat the defending race winner off the restart again to prevent Larson from becoming the fourth back-to-back winner of the Brickyard.",
      "It also alleviated the frustration Wallace felt Saturday when he spent most of the qualifying session on the provisional pole only to see Chase Briscoe surpass him with one of the last runs in the session.",
      "He made sure there was no repeat Sunday, giving an added boost to the 23XI Racing co-owned by basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and last week's race winner, Denny Hamlin, as it continues to battle NASCAR in court over its charter status.",
      "\"Knowing how big this race is, knowing all the noise that's going on in the background, to set that all aside is a testament to these people here on the 23 team,\" Wallace said in a post-race interview. \"I'm excited to see how far the goalpost has moved, so I get to go and chase that now.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: Amid a summer of distraction, President Trump seeks ways to divert attention back to his economic agenda. Leaving behind the Epstein files controversy, Trump teed off in Scotland for a weekend of golf, ahead of trade talks with two key European leaders, as his tariff deadline looms.",
      "Before he left, he took his fight with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell straight to the Federal Reserve facility itself, raising questions about renovation costs.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): It looks like it's about $3.1 billion. It went up a little bit or a lot. So the 2.7 is now 3.1. And\u2026",
      "JEROME POWELL (Federal Reserve Chairman): I'm not aware of that, Mr. President.",
      "DONALD TRUMP: Yes, they \u2013 it just\u2026",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will check in with White House budget chief Russell Vought, who was with the president during his trip to the Fed. Plus, we will ask whether he's eying another round of spending cuts.",
      "And we will get the Democratic response from Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen.",
      "Then: Trump's campaign to reshape higher education stretches beyond fines on Ivy League schools. More than 50 top universities are under investigation and at risk of losing funds. We will hear from the president of The Ohio State University, Ted Carter. Finally: Israel announces it will allow aid into Gaza, where the hunger crisis has reached catastrophic levels. When will it stop? We will talk with the foreign minister of France, Jean-Noel Barrot, about international pressure to end the conflict.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Washington is a little quieter this week. The House started its recess early. And when they return in September, funding the government will be top priority.",
      "Meanwhile, we're expecting some key economic indicators. The Fed will announce its outlook on interest rates Wednesday and we will see a new jobs report Friday. That's the same day President Trump is set to slap tariffs on dozens of countries, including America's top trading partners.",
      "We begin today with the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought.",
      "Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "RUSSELL VOUGHT (Director, Office of Management and Budget): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much to get to with you. Let's start on what's going on with the Federal Reserve.",
      "If you take the president at his word, he does not intend to fire the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, though he's still criticizing him. What is the president seeking in a successor when his term ends in May 2026?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, I think he's looking for a chairman that's not continually too late to the developments in the economic marketplace.",
      "And I think what we've seen with Chairman Powell, he was very late in the Biden administration to raise rates, to articulate the concern with regard to the Biden administration's spending.",
      "We all knew on the outside \u2013 even Larry Summers knew that we were going to have an issue with regard to inflation. And we saw, you know, recent historical inflationary levels that we hadn't seen before. And now he is too late to lower inflation rates. And so that is the kind of thing that we want to see in the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.",
      "And one of the reasons why is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: More of a focus on inflation?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: An ability to recognize the developments in the economic marketplace.",
      "In this case, we want to be able to see lower rates and to have an ability to get the economy going.",
      "And one of the things we saw with Powell is that one of the reasons he was so late was because he didn't understand that inflation is largely a monetary phenomenon. He kept saying that inflation was transitory. He didn't tackle the problem. And now he's again too late.",
      "And you marry that with fiscal mismanagement at the Fed. It's a huge problem that we're trying to raise the country's awareness level with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as you know, the Fed is structured in a way where he doesn't have unilateral control. There's a governing board. Others weigh in.",
      "You did work on Project 2025, and we went back and looked at what they said in there about the Fed. As people may know, that's a Heritage Foundation product that got a lot of scrutiny during the campaign. The chapter on the Fed called for Congress to overhaul the Fed's focus and powers.",
      "Is that what you're looking to do in 2026?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: I don't even know what that chapter says.",
      "All I know, in terms of the president, the president has run on an agenda. He's been very clear about that. All that we're doing is \u2013 in this administration is running on \u2013 is implementing his agenda.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't want to overhaul the Fed?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We want an economic system that works for the American people. That includes the Fed. And the president has been very clear that all he's asking from the Fed is lower interest rates, because he thinks it's important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I do want to ask about spending, or lack thereof, that the Trump administration is trying to direct.",
      "The White House said they will actually release the remaining $5 billion in education funds that had been withheld from public schools until recently. There were 10 Republican senators very worried about this, and came out and said your claim that the money goes to radical left-wing programs was wrong.",
      "What changed your mind? What made you release this money?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, we had been going through a programmatic review with these funds. These are programs that, as an administration, we don't support. We've called for the elimination of them in the president's budget for precisely the reasons of which they flow to often left-wing organizations.",
      "Thankfully, the president came into office, put in an executive order that said it can't \u2013 these funds can't go to these types of initiatives. I will just give you one example. English language acquisition was flowing to the New York school public education system to go into illegal immigration advocacy organizations.",
      "Preschool development grants doesn't actually go to preschoolers. It goes to the curriculum for putting CRT into the school system for people as young \u2013 children as young as 4 years old.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these senators said it goes to adult learners working to gain employment skills and after-school programs.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: And what we\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you deemed it is necessary?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We believe that it's important to get the money out right now, but we have taken an extended time frame to be able to make sure it doesn't go to the types of things that we saw under the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, you know, Senator Lindsey Graham told \"The Washington Post\" the administration is looking at considering clawbacks from the Department of Education, this, you know, rescissions process.",
      "Is that the plan? Are you seeking to claw back education funds in a rescissions package? And, if so, when are you sending that up?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We may be. We're always looking at potential rescission options.",
      "This is an \u2013 this is a set of funding that we wanted to make sure it got out. We did our programmatic review. We wanted to make sure it got out before the school year, even though it's multiyear funding. This is not funding that would expire at the end of this year. We are looking to do rescissions package.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When\u2026",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We're always gauging the extent to which the Congress is willing to participate in that process. And we're \u2013 be looking at a lot of different options along those lines, but certainly have nothing to announce here today.",
      "But we're thrilled that we had the first rescissions package in decades, and we've got the process moving again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no rescissions package before September?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Not here to say that. We're looking at all of our options. We will look at it and assess where the Hill is, what are the particular funding opportunities that we have, but nothing that we're going to announce today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because some of the funds that do expire in September have also been held up on the health front.",
      "Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, 13 other Republicans came out with a letter saying that you've been slow in releasing funds for the National Institute of Health for research into cardiovascular disease, cancer. Are those funds going to be released?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Again, we're going through the same process with the NIH that we did with the education.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's a time cost here.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: I mean, $2 million for injecting dogs with cocaine that the NIH spent money on, $75,000 for Harvard to study blowing lizards off of trees with leaf blowers, that's the kind of waste that we've seen at the NIH.",
      "And that's not even getting to the extent to which the NIH was weaponized against the American people over the last several years, with regard to funding gain of function research that caused the pandemic. We have a \u2013 we have an agency that needs dramatic overhaul. Thankfully, we have a great new head of it, but we're going to have to go line by line to make sure the NIH is funded properly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to release the cancer funding research and the cardiovascular disease research funding?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We're going to continue \u2013 we're going to continue to go to the same process that we have gone through with regard to the Department of Education at every one of these agencies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before September, that money will be released?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: And we will release that funding when we are done with that review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, there's concern that you're withholding the money, hoping it just won't be spent.",
      "I mean, if you look at the White House budget, it does call for a 26 percent cut to HHS, $18 billion cut to NIH. Is this just a backdoor way to make those cuts happen?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, I don't want to speak to any specific program with regard to what we might do with regard to rescissions throughout the end of this fiscal year, but we certainly recognize that we have the ability and the executive tools to fund less than what Congress appropriated and to use the tools that the Impoundment Control Act, a bill we're not \u2013 a law that we're not entirely thrilled with, gives us to \u2013 to send up rescissions towards the end of the fiscal year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, just for our viewers, the Impoundment Control Act is the legal mechanism for the president to use to delay or avoid spending funds appropriated by Congress.",
      "Democrats think you want to have an argument over the power of the purse and who holds it. Do you want that to go to the Supreme Court?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, look, for 200 years, presidents had the ability to spend less than the congressional appropriations. No one would ever dispute and our founders didn't dispute that Congress has the ability to set the appropriation ceiling.",
      "But 200 years of presidents, up until the 1970s, had the ability to spend less if they could find efficiencies or if they could find waste that an agency was doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a yes.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We lost that ability in the 1970s. The president ran on restoring that funding authority to the presidency, and it's vital.",
      "If you look at when we started to lose control fiscally, it was right around the time of the 1970s.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, many senators, Republican senators, are very uncomfortable with the tactics that you are using, Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins, that chair of the Appropriations Committee that is really running this \u2013 this funding process.",
      "And Senator Collins said you're pushing the limits of what the executive can do without the consent of the \u2013 of the legislative branch. You need to work with her to get your budget through. And, in fact, you need to also be able to get Democrats on board to get to that 60-vote threshold to pass any kind of government funding to avoid a government shutdown at the end of September.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: I have a great relationship with Senator Collins. I appreciate the work she does.",
      "She is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, so obviously we're going to have differences of opinion as to the extent to which these tools should be used. I mean, she had concerns with the rescissions package. The rescissions package was a vote that Congress had to make these cuts permanent. And yet\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Under \u2013 on a party-line vote. She says, you want to go do these clawbacks, you do it through regular order, and you can put \u2013 you can put rescissions into an appropriations bill.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: But that was, in fact, under regular order. That's the challenge, is, the appropriators want to use all the rescissions, they want to put them in their bills, and then they want to spend higher on other programs.",
      "We act \u2013 we're $37 trillion in debt, Margaret. We actually need to reduce the deficit and have a dollar of cut go to a dollar of deficit reduction. That's not what the appropriators want. And it's not news that the Trump administration is going to bring a paradigm shift to this town in terms of the business of spending the people's money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would acknowledge that you just added to the debt and to the deficit with this\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: No, I would not acknowledge that. We reduced the deficit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The spending and tax bill that just passed?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Correct. We\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you lifted the debt ceiling.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: The debt ceiling is an \u2013 is \u2013 is an extension of the cap on what's needed to pay your previous bills.",
      "In terms of the bill itself, it is $400 billion in deficit reduction, $1.5 trillion in mandatory savings reforms, the biggest we've seen in history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, a few weeks ago, that the appropriations process needs to be less bipartisan. You only have 53 Republicans. You do need Democrats to get on board, here.",
      "Is saying something like that intended to undermine negotiations? Do you actually want a government shutdown?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: No, of course not. We want to extend the funding at the end of this fiscal year. We understand, from a math perspective, we're going to need Democrats to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does less bipartisan mean?",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, Margaret, the whole week, the Democrats were making the argument that, if you pass the rescissions bill, that you were undermining the bipartisan appropriations process.",
      "So, if Brian Schatz and every other appropriator is making that argument for a week\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, a Republican, said that.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: \u2026 you have to be able to respond and say, if you're going to call a rescissions package that you told us during the month of January and February that we should use to do less spending, if you're going to say that is undermining the bipartisan appropriations process, then maybe we should have a conversation about that. That is all it was meant to convey.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the alternative to this process is another continuing resolution, these stopgap measures. Are you open to that, because that would lock in Biden era funding? What is your alternative here? If you want a less bipartisan process, how do you solve for this? Because it sounds like you're laying the predicate for a shutdown.",
      "DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We are open to \u2013 we are not laying the predicate for a shutdown. We are laying the predicate for the fact that the only thing that has worked in this town \u2013 the bipartisan appropriations process is broken.",
      "It leads to omnibus bills. We want to prevent an omnibus bill, and all options are on the table to be able to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Russell Vought, thank you for your time today.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is one of those appropriators we were just speaking about with the budget director.",
      "You just heard everything he laid out. There were no specifics on when these clawbacks could be coming, but they're on the table. He says they don't want a shutdown. He didn't seem to say they want a continuing resolution.",
      "Do you know what's coming?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-Maryland): Not really.",
      "The one thing we know \u2013 and you asked Russ Vought about this \u2013 was, he says that the process is too bipartisan right now, meaning that they want to use this process just to ram through the agenda. And the overall agenda, we saw when they passed the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which was beautiful for billionaires, but not really for anybody else, which is to provide tax cuts for very wealthy people at the expense of everybody else.",
      "And I do want to say, Margaret, I heard him deny that that bill increased the deficit and debt. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office just said it increased our debt by $3.5 trillion before added interest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's using an accounting gimmick in regard to the benchmark.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: As \u2013 and Republicans have called out this accounting gimmick. So, when they come\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it was accepted.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, they sort of unilaterally imposed it. It was not accepted by Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: And it was a departure from previous efforts.",
      "But then they come back and they say that they want to cut these important programs, NIH and other things, to reduce the deficit, when, in fact, what they're doing it for is to help try to finance those tax cuts for very wealthy people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's just heading us towards pretty unchartered territory and very unclear whether we will be able to avoid a government shutdown.",
      "Democrats are going to be blamed if there's a shutdown, don't you think? I mean, how do you sidestep this?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, we certainly don't want a government shutdown. And I think everybody has heard Russ Vought say that they want a less bipartisan process.",
      "What that tells me is they're willing just to use their powers to try to shut down the government if they don't get their way. And what's ironic about this, Margaret, is, you have Russ Vought calling for these deep cuts to education, NIH, when he has asked for an increase for his OMB budget.",
      "He asked for a 13 percent increase for his OMB budget. He's asked for more people to join the OMB staff, while he's talking about RIFing people at other departments, like the Department of\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes, getting rid of firing people in the Department of Veterans Affairs and other important priorities.",
      "So it's hard to take the OMB director seriously when he says that they didn't increase the debt and when he says he wants to cut things, except for his own budget and staff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if they do head towards a government shutdown, why would there be any benefit, unless it is to prioritize funding certain agencies and deprioritizing other agencies?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, that\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that goes back to the executive, doesn't it, that authority?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, that \u2013 ultimately, though, you need, for example, four Republican senators to stand behind what he's calling for.",
      "And what they called for is sort of just a double cross on the process, right? That's what the so-called \u2013 rescissions is just a Washington name for double cross. They support one thing one day. The president even signs off. And then they come back and say they changed their mind.",
      "And what we're asking is for four Republican senators just to publicly declare that, when they say they're going to fund the Veterans Affairs Department, that they actually mean it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That they won't later agree to claw that money back.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "So one of the things the Trump administration is clear and did get clawbacks of is foreign assistance. However, there's an exception. In June, the administration announced it would give $30 million to this Israeli- backed organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the GHF. I know you're familiar with it.",
      "It delivers aid through armed military contractors who stand behind the Israeli military in four designated zones that Gazans then have to get themselves to in order to receive the aid. The State Department says they're sending this money. Have they?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: To my knowledge, they have. Although we have asked for the details, we haven't gotten them.",
      "In fact, just today, I'm sending a letter to Secretary Rubio signed with 20 of my colleagues calling for more information, but also calling for defunding this. American taxpayers should not be spending one penny to fund this private organization backed by mercenaries and by the IDF that has become a death trap.",
      "Over 1,000 people have died from being shot and killed as starving people crowd to try to get food at just these four sites.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The \u2013 just to be clear here, the State Department says they're going to send $30 million.",
      "Reuters had reported that there were documents they obtained showing $7 million had already been sent to these what you call armed mercenaries. But the Trump administration says this is the best way, this is the only way to keep money \u2013 to keep food out of the hands of Hamas, which financially benefits off reselling it to desperate, starving people.",
      "Is there another way to feed desperate, starving people?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes. And this is a big lie, the claim that, when the U.N. organizations were delivering food to Palestinians, civilians, that it was being systematically diverted to Hamas.",
      "I want to say loudly and clearly this is a big lie. Trump and the\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The systematic part of that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: The systematic, but that is their claim. They claim that essentially large amounts of aid are being diverted to Hamas.",

      "So what the Netanyahu government did was scrap a delivery system that was working at delivering food and assistance in favor of this other effort.

      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "ELIZABETH PALMER (voice over): In an abrupt reversal, Israel cleared the way for more aid to Gaza. Overnight, the military air dropped food and supplies. But those pallets are a fraction of what's needed. The bulk of the aid is on trucks, waiting to go. And in what could be a game changer, Israel says it will establish secure routes through the war zone so that trucks will no longer be shot at or looted.",
      "Gaza's misery has shocked the world. And international medical agencies say children, especially the poorest and those with special needs, are suffering from acute malnutrition.",
      "Since March, when the ceasefire ended, aid has trickled into the war zone, but not nearly enough. Israel sidelined the main U.N. agencies and funneled most aid through the privately run Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has only four distribution hubs for 2 million people.",
      "As hunger grew, so did reports of Israeli soldiers shooting a crowds trying to get something to eat. Even so, desperation pushed Gazans to risk death, plundering aid from moving convoys.",
      "Alongside the shooting war, there was also a war of words. Israel's military insisted it was letting in plenty of aid, it's just the U.N. agencies weren't picking it up. The agencies said the army made it too dangerous.",
      "And while the blame game played out, Gazans grew thinner and sicker.",
      "Now, Israel has announced a change of policy. Aid has begun moving under the new rules today. For Gazans, it's not a minute too soon.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was our senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer.",
      "We turn to the French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who joins us this morning from Paris.",
      "Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation. Overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states, are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT (Foreign Minister of France): What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is \u2013 is \u2013 is now on the brink of a food catastrophe. And we've been working out over the months to try and relieve the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in Elavish (ph), in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza.",
      "So, we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity afforded by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: We have with the European Union started tough discussions with the Israeli government who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused blood bath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions.",
      "We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects, with 3,400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political \u2013 a two-state solution.",
      "But what we call for is, of course, the immediate ceasefire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed, and the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two-state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the U.N. in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first Western U.N. Security Council member to do so.",
      "And the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it \"reckless.\" He says it \"serves Hamas propaganda,\" \"sets back peace,\" and considers it \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th.\"",
      "In your government's view, why is he wrong?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: So, we \u2013 the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two-state solution process, that was \u2013 that is today threatened, more threatened, that it \u2013 it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone because by work \u2013 by \u2013 by recognizing or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has \u2013 that will be co-chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant, historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of this two- state solution and guarantee its security guarantees for (INAUDIBLE).",
      "The two-state solution is very simple. And I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back into this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and in security. And what we're doing by bringing the Palestinian authority leader to recognize 7th of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas \u2013 the disarmament for the \u2013 the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating or recreating the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward. And we are paving the way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said. The U.S. ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary. We shall \u2013 the short-term objectives, ceasefire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas and the long-term objective, peace and stability in the region.",
      "But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics (ph), a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the \u2013 or create an off-ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza.",
      "Now, the terms we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords. But in the meantime, inaction is not an option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out, though, and said, \"the French students were removed because they're Jewish.\" Have you determined whether this was, indeed, an act of anti- Semitism?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has \u2013 to express our \u2013 our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in \u2013 in France, and we've made the same request. We keep following this situation as it unravels.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, to \u2013 to early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon and the world won't know.",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing. And alongside the Germany and the U.K., we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority, in close coordination with U.S. authorities, in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant roll-back of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things have changed. Until then and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement.",
      "We now want more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also its \u2013 the ballistic component as well as the regional destabilization activity that Iran has been conducting. Unless we \u2013 unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the U.K. will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted ten years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment and on banking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?",
      "JEAN-NOEL BARROT: Oh, we've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We \u2013 we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran after the 12-day war to go back to a discussion with the U.S. And we'll keep pressing them to do so because indeed if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, thank you very much for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Columbus, Ohio, and the president of The Ohio State University, Ted Carter.",
      "President Carter, welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "TED CARTER (President, Ohio State University): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you on this Sunday from Columbus, Ohio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you very directly about these Trump administration claims that Ohio State is one of 60 universities that they deemed may have anti-Semitic practices and policies on campus. They say you're being investigated for them and for failing to end diversity policies, which could be a violation of the Civil Rights Act. What's the status of the probes and \u2013 and how much pressure are you under?",
      "TED CARTER: To be quite frank, I'm not feeling a lot of pressure. Our understanding is that we're on those lists because we had been previously on those lists under the Biden administration. We had been working with the Office of Civil Rights during that administration. And I think mostly that was a holdover.",
      "We are more than happy to talk to anybody from the Office of Civil Rights. We stand behind our actions. We know how we acted during the time of the protests. We never had an encampment here at Ohio State. We had some attempted. We didn't allow them. That's our long-standing rules on The Oval, which is the centerpiece of our campus. So, I'm confident that as this played out forward, that we're going to be just fine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration did publish Ohio State on the list of universities it's probing. And when you look at some of the issues they've raised at other places, you look at the results of freezing $3 billion in contracts at Harvard, $1 billion at Cornell, hundreds of millions of dollars of research funding at universities like Brown. Are you worried that your federal funds could be in jeopardy because of this?",
      "TED CARTER: Well, like I always say to my staff and my people, if we do the right things for the right reasons, everything will play out. And we've been doing it that way since I've been here since 1 January of 2024. Our research funding here at Ohio State has grown leaps and bounds over the last couple years. We're actually ranked number 11th in the country, ahead of Harvard, ahead of UNC-Chapel Hill. Our revenues last year were $1.6 billion, $775 million of that came from the federal government, largely in NIH and NSF.",
      "As we sit here today, we've had some research grants impacted, but in the tens of millions of dollars. Nothing like you're seeing at our Ivy League colleagues. And a lot of that is still in litigation. So, I can't even tell you what the \u2013 the number of dollars that we may lose. But against the $1.6 billion, it's pretty small, even though it's had some impact on some of our researchers.",
      "Unlike some of our counterparts, we have a significant research arm here, 14,000 faculty, post doc students that do the research here, and it is significant. It goes way beyond the numbers and the dollars. It's what it's doing for the community, what it's doing to extend and save and change lives and what it's doing in agriculture, what it's doing for our police force.",
      "So, what I would tell you is the \u2013 at this moment today, even compared to where we were last year, we're still up in our research revenue about 7 percent from where we were last year. And we're \u2013 we're proceeding to ask for more grants so that we can be a cancer-free world here in our lifetime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we all hope for that future, sir.",
      "But you sound not to be concerned, but I did read that earlier when you had the Buckeyes football team at the White House earlier in the year, and that was well covered, \"The Wall Street Journal\" said you told President Trump and Vice President Vance that, quote, \"Ohio State is not the enemy.\"",
      "Why did you feel you had to say that? What did you mean?",
      "TED CARTER: Well, that might have been taken a little bit out of context. I kind of said that in jest a little bit to the vice president when I had a chance to meet with him. And we had a long conversation. It was a very productive conversation. I won't go into all the details.",
      "But the point is, they know that Ohio State is doing the right things for the right reasons. I have said publicly that I believe the future of higher education is going to go through the large public land grant flagship institutions like The Ohio State University.",
      "I look at what we're doing today. And, yes, like many other universities, there's a lot of concern about the future, what's coming out of the federal government, and even what's coming out of our state government here in Ohio. But right now, I feel like we can still play defense, still understand how to adjust, kind of make sure that we're getting our bat on the ball, so to speak, and playing defense and protecting the plate. But we're also looking at how we can play offense.",
      "This is a time where institutions like Ohio State, we are very financially secure. We're actually looking to invest in ourselves. You know, I just reflect on the graduation ceremony that we just had this past May. We produce about 18,000 graduates a year. But at that ceremony, we graduated 12,400. All of them, by the way, got their diploma that day that they earned. And 90 percent of those students, 90 percent, already had a job or they were going to another higher academic endeavor. And 70 percent of those undergraduate students are staying in the state of Ohio, 66 percent of the Ph.D. and masters are staying in the state of Ohio.",
      "This is a wonderful workforce development program that is what is raising the confidence of Ohioans and the American public in higher education. And that is starting to change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance was on this program a number of times. And one when them when he was still a senator. I spoke to him about his views on higher education. He is an Ohio State alum undergrad. And he said he believes universities \u2013 he wasn't speaking of yours, but he said \"universities are controlled by left-wing foundations and they're going in the wrong direction.\"",
      "Do you think he has a point?",
      "TED CARTER: I think higher education has started to build that reputation. And you can even see that in the Gallup-Lumina polls. You know, I was the superintendent of the Naval Academy from 2014 to 2019. You know, in that Gallup poll in 2015 said that nearly 60 percent of Americans had high confidence in post-secondary education.",
      "Now, go ahead and just move that needle nine years forward, and yet two in three Americans said they did not have confidence in higher education. That's a really bad mark. Americans were saying higher education costs too much. They were saying that the return on investment was difficult to prove. They were even saying some of the research being done may not impact them or their families. And, yes, there was this conversation about the potential indoctrination of students or that institutions were leaning very liberal.",
      "You know, we, as administrators of higher education, maybe ought to listen to the American public and say, maybe we haven't always gotten it right. So, I'm here to say here at The Ohio State University, we have paid attention to that. We are making efforts to make affordability a key issue for students.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TED CARTER: I mentioned that graduating class, 57 percent of those undergraduates left with zero debt. Zero debt. And the other 43 percent that left with debt was less than $24,000. And as we look across, you know, our hiring practices, I have 8,500 faculty.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TED CARTER: It is the best group of faculty I have ever worked with in my 12 years in leading in higher ed, and that's saying quite a bit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I \u2013 on that \u2013",
      "TED CARTER: And I will tell you that as we hire the future, we're looking across the entire political spectrum for who we hire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On that point, you talked about what happened at the state level. The Republican-controlled state legislature passed a law that eliminates the diversity programs, does a number of things, but it also requires professors to post their course syllabus, syllabi, online, and their contact information.",
      "Do you think that this is meant to intimidate? Are you concerned? Is your faculty concerned about the focus on what they're doing?",
      "TED CARTER: Yes, I have talked to our faculty, our \u2013 you know, through our faculty senate and our leadership. There are some concerns, of course, because we have not done that before. We've got some time before we implement that. We have put all the pieces of Senate Bill 1, which is the general assembly's bill here in the state of Ohio, into implementation phase. We're still working through some of the details.",
      "But let me tell you, the principles of academic freedom, what is taught in the classroom, the \u2013 the move towards scholarly pursuit, the research that we do here at Ohio State, those are things that we are still very passionate about. And I know that we're going to continue that work. And yet we'll still follow the law. We'll still follow some of the federal policies that are coming out. We're ready and prepared to do all of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, to \u2013 to that point, you saw what Columbia University did this week in paying that $200 million fine to settle their dispute with the Trump administration. They also agreed to an outside monitor to assure the school complies with stamping out diversity programs.",
      "Does this precedent trouble you? I mean, would you take a deal like that?",
      "TED CARTER: Well, I can't speak to those institutions because I'm not leading them. I \u2013 I know both the \u2013 President Shipman and some of the other Ivy League presidents. They're colleagues. And they're having to do, I think, what I would call be in survival mode, quite frankly. We're not going through any of that here at Ohio State, and nor do I think that we will. I mean, obviously, we have a new state law where public institutions",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TED CARTER: So, that means we're going to be transparent and put out everything that we do so that the state of Ohio \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TED CARTER: The people and the entire country can see it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch to see what happens. Good luck to you, sir.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "Federal debt, which currently stands at more than $36 trillion, is projected to rise due to the new tax cuts and spending bill signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, according to forecasts from economists and public policy think tanks. The nation's deficit could rise by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years because of the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0said, citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the rebate could be \"for people of a certain income level,\" although he didn't specify the threshold that he's considering.",

      "Tariffs vary from country to country, but they're paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, or manufacturers that import materials and components from other countries, like Ford Motor. So far, some companies have been\u00a0swallowing the higher costs\u00a0rather than passing them on to consumers, although the\u00a0latest inflation report\u00a0signaled that higher tariff rates may be edging into consumer prices.",
      "Rebate checks have been floated by Mr. Trump previously, with the president saying in February he was considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. During the pandemic, taxpayers received three rebate checks \u2014 two under the first Trump administration, and the third under the Biden administration \u2014 aimed at offsetting the economic impact of the crisis.",
      "Typically, such rebates are issued through the tax code, which would require Congress to pass new tax legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to issue checks.",
      "Lawmakers earlier this month passed a massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, which authorizes some new tax breaks, but doesn't include a rebate based on tariffs.",
      "Some of the bill's new tax cuts are limited to low- and middle-income taxpayers. For instance, its new $6,000 deduction for senior citizens phases out for single taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 and married filers with earnings over $150,000.",

    "summary": "House Republicans on Tuesday advanced a measure that would rename the Kennedy Center's opera house after first lady Melania Trump \u2014 as President Trump boosts his influence over the center.",
    "story": [
      "House Republicans on Tuesday advanced a measure that would rename the Kennedy Center for the Performing\u00a0Arts' opera house after first lady Melania Trump \u2014 as President Trump and his allies boost their influence over the D.C. cultural institution.",
      "The proposed renaming was folded into an amendment to a bill that would set fiscal year 2026 funding levels for the Interior Department and several other federal agencies, including the Kennedy Center. The amendment \u2014 and the bill itself \u2014 were advanced by the House Appropriations Committee in a hearing Tuesday.",
      "The renaming was authored by Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, who pointed to the first lady's role as honorary chair of the Kennedy Center board.",
      "The renaming was not requested by the Trump administration, Simpson's communications director Lexi Hamel told CBS News in an email.",
      "\"Naming a theater after her is an excellent way to recognize her appreciation for the arts,\" Simpson, who chairs the Appropriations Committee's Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Subcommittee, wrote in a statement.",
      "The subcommittee's top Democrat, Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, criticized the renaming idea in Tuesday's hearing and said she was surprised to learn about it.",
      "\"The Republicans snuck in, I think, something that's slightly divisive, which is renaming one section of the Kennedy Center after a family member of this administration,\" she said.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The nameplate over the opera house \u2014 which seats nearly 2,400 people and is one of several spaces in the Kennedy Center \u2014 is unlikely to change any time soon. Spending bills like the one advanced Tuesday generally need 60 votes to pass the Senate, meaning even if it makes it through the full House intact, several Senate Democrats will need to vote for it. Lawmakers also have until the end of September to pass funding measures in order to avert the possibility of a potential partial government shutdown.",
      "But the idea follows a push by Mr. Trump to assert more control over the Kennedy Center.",
      "Weeks after retaking office, Mr. Trump removed some members of the cultural institution's board of trustees and stocked the board with a range of Trump allies \u2014 including Attorney General Pam Bondi and country singer Lee Greenwood. Mr. Trump now serves as chairman of the Kennedy Center board, and his ally Richard Grenell, who also serves as the White House envoy for special missions, is the center's president.",
      "The moves were partially intended to pivot the Kennedy Center away from what the president views as \"woke culture,\" a source told CBS News earlier this year. Mr. Trump has publicly criticized some of the performances hosted by the center.",
      "\"NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA \u2014 ONLY THE BEST,\" he wrote on Truth Social in February.",
      "The moves have drawn criticism, with the producers of musical megahit \"Hamilton\" calling off a slate of performances next year due to what it called \"a new spirit of partisanship.\" Last month, the president and first lady attended a performance of \"Les Miserables\" at the Kennedy Center, drawing a mixture of cheers and boos.",
      "Pingree criticized Republicans' handling of the Kennedy Center in Tuesday's hearing, arguing the party has given the president \"carte blanche\" over the cultural center. She pointed to the $256.7 million appropriated for the Kennedy Center over the next four years in the Trump-backed \"big, beautiful bill\" that passed earlier this month.",
      "Simpson responded Tuesday, \"Let me see if I got this straight: So, we're upset that we didn't fund the arts, but we're upset that we did fund the arts?\"",

    "story": [
      "PepsiCo is introducing a new prebiotic soda this fall geared toward health-conscious customers.",
      "The food and beverage company said Monday that the new product is designed to meet changing consumer needs and offer \"more functional ingredients.\" The new drink, which will come in cola and cherry vanilla flavors, will contain five grams of cane sugar, three grams of prebiotic fiber and no artificial sweeteners, while a single serving will have 30 calories, according to Pepsi.",
      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The new cola will be available for purchase online this fall and in stores next year, Pepsi said.",
      "The product announcement comes only months after Pepsi\u00a0acquired Poppi, which is marketed as a healthier alternative for soda lovers, for nearly $2 billion. The low-calorie soda contains a mix of prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider.",
      "The prebiotic and probiotic food and drink sector has grown quickly in recent years as consumers increasingly seek out gut-healthy alternatives to soda that contain less sugar.\u00a0According\u00a0to consulting firm Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at $262 million in 2024. Global sales are expected to grow 7.6% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"Consumer demand is certainly moving healthier,\" said Christopher Palmedo, an associate professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy. \"Decades ago, gargantuan Big Gulps were the rage. Now it's probiotic Pepsi.\"",
      "\"From a public health perspective, that's a good trend,\" Palmedo said, while noting that most beverages in the market, including probiotic drinks like Pepsi's are \"ultra-processed\" making their health claims questionable.",
      "While consumer preferences have shifted away from soda and toward healthier options, demand for carbonated drinks overall remains high. Nearly 80% U.S. consumers drink carbonated drinks at least once a week, according to Innova Market Insights.",
      "Pepsi is moving to introduce healthier offerings to boost lagging soda sales. On an earnings call last week, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will introduce protein-enhanced versions of its snacks and new protein beverages this year. He also said Pepsi will relaunch Lay's potato chips and Tostitos tortilla chips without artificial colors or ingredients.",
      "\"I think protein is clearly a subsegment in our food and beverages categories that is growing fast,\" Laguarta said in the July 17 call. \"Consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is meeting on Monday with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the U.S. leader's visit to Scotland. While ostensibly a private trip, marked by multiple rounds of golf on his own luxury courses, Mr. Trump has also done some business \u2014 including nailing down a long-sought-after U.S.-European Union trade agreement.",
      "After meeting for just over one hour with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Mr. Trump emerged to say, \"We have good news. We've reached a deal.\"",
      "When considered as a combined economy, the EU bloc is the second largest in the world behind the U.S. Including goods and services, U.S.-EU trade is worth about $2 trillion per year.",
      "\"I think it's great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games,\" Mr. Trump said of the framework agreement. \"I think it's the biggest deal ever made.\"",
      "\"It's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" agreed von der Leyen. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "President Trump's meeting Starmer was also expected to touch on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed a framework trade deal\u00a0last month. Starmer has made it clear he wants to keep pushing Mr. Trump to further ease tariffs on British steel and other imports as the details of the agreement are hashed out.",
      "Both U.S. and U.K. officials said the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine would also come up in their discussion on Monday.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, Mr. Trump told reporters he would likely reduce the 50-day deadline he gave to Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire deal with Ukraine before he imposes new sanctions against Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump didn't specify how much he would reduce the timeline, but said he was \"very disappointed\" in Putin for continuing to attack Ukraine. Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said his meeting with Starmer would provide a chance to celebrate the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement now on the books, along with the new EU deal.",
      "Most EU member nations' governments voiced support for that agreement on Monday, though some of them unenthusiastically \u2013 and the French Prime Minister even took a jab at the bloc, accusing it of \"submission\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",
      "There's was good news for U.S. companies that sell products into the EU market, too, as Mr. Trump announced that all 27 EU nations \"will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff.\"",
      "The agreement was made at Trump's luxury golf resort in Turnberry, on the Scottish coast, where the president spent the weekend teeing off.",
      "The deal avoids a trans-Atlantic trade war that could have unfolded on Friday, when Mr. Trump had threatened to impose a blanket 30% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, which had vowed to retaliate.",
      "That deadline remains in place for countries that have yet to make a deal with the U.S., including Mexico, Canada, and most consequentially, China.",
      "Trade talks between Beijing and Washington were taking place Monday in Stockholm, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in interviews over the weekend that the Aug. 1 deadline for deals to be reached wasn't flexible.",
      "\"No extensions, no more grace periods. August 1, the tariffs are set. They'll go into place. Customs will start collecting the money, and off we go,\" he said.",

Both countries recalled their ambassadors and Thailand shut all border crossings with Cambodia, with an exception for migrant Cambodian workers returning home.",

    "summary": "Tadej Poga\u010dar, a 26-year-old cycling star from Slovenia, clinched his fourth Tour de France title on Sunday.",
    "story": [
      "The roads were dangerously slippery after heavy rain. A fourth Tour de France title was all but won anyway, so finishing safely in the pack would do fine for Tadej Poga\u010dar. Especially considering Sunday's final stage had already been neutralized for safety reasons and he just had to complete the race.",
      "Surely there was no need to launch a seemingly pointless attack and risk crashing?",
      "But holding back or being cautious rarely appeals to Poga\u010dar, the 26-year-old cycling star from Slovenia. He clinched his fourth Tour title in inimitably daring style on Sunday and further cemented his place among cycling's greats.",
      "Even though he really did not need to, and risked falling on oil slick-wet roads, Poga\u010dar simply could not help himself. Against all logical opinion, he tried winning Sunday's 21st and final stage with trademark uphill attacks, only to fall short of the stage win itself.",
      "\"In the end I found myself in the front, even though I didn't have the energy,\" said Poga\u010dar, who won the Tour last year and in 2020 and 2021.",
      "\"Just speechless to win the Tour de France, this one feels especially amazing,\" Poga\u010dar added. \"Just super proud that I can wear this yellow jersey.\"",
      "Two-time Tour champion Jonas Vingegaard finished the overall race 4 minutes, 24 seconds behind Poga\u010dar in second place and Florian Lipowitz was 11 minutes adrift in third.",
      "Belgian rider Wout van Aert won the 21st and last stage, which broke with tradition and featured three climbs of Montmartre hill.",
      "Because of heavy rain and the risk of crashes, organizers had earlier neutralized the times 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the end, effectively giving Poga\u010dar the victory \u2014 providing he crossed the finish line.",
      "He did the opposite of what almost every rider would do with victory a near certainty.",
      "As the rain teemed down, he set a tremendous pace in the Montmartre climbs as fans cheered all along the cobbled Rue Lepic, with flags and fans hanging out of windows.",
      "Only five riders were left with Poga\u010dar on the third ascension of the 1.1-kilometer Montmartre hill.",
      "After fending off American Matteo Jorgenson, he was caught cold near the top as Van Aert launched a stunning attack to drop \u2014 yes, drop! \u2014 Poga\u010dar, the world's best climber, on the steepest section.",
      "\"Hats off to Wout, he was incredibly strong,\" Poga\u010dar said.",
      "Van Aert rolled back down for a prestigious stage win on the famed Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Poga\u010dar looked weary as he crossed the line in fourth place, 19 seconds behind.",
      "But then it was time to celebrate title No. 4. Although, don't expect Poga\u010dar to make any headlines on that front.",
      "\"Everyone celebrates in their own way, I just want peace and some nice weather, not like here today,\" Poga\u010dar said. \"Just to enjoy some quiet days at home.\"",
      "Only four riders have won the showcase race five times: Belgian Eddy Merckx, Spaniard Miguel Indur\u00e1in and Frenchmen Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault.",
      "Poga\u010dar won four stages this year to take his Tour tally to 21 and 30 at major races, including six at the Giro d'Italia and three at the Spanish Vuelta.",
      "The UAE Team Emirates leader praised his teammates.",
      "\"I think the second week was the decisive moment,\" Poga\u010dar said. \"We took more advantage.\"",
      "Lipowitz, meanwhile, secured his first career podium at a Grand Tour, the alternative name given to the three major races.",
      "His performance, following his third-placed finish last month at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, suggests the 24-year-old German rider could challenge in the near future.",
      "Traditionally, the last stage is largely processional with riders doing laps around Paris. The Tour broke with tradition after the success of the Paris Olympics road race, which also took in Montmartre, famous for its Sacr\u00e9-Coeur basilica.",
      "It was the fifth straight year where Poga\u010dar and Vingegaard finished 1-2 at the Tour.",
      "Vingegaard was second in 2021, before beating Poga\u010dar the next two years with the Slovenian second. When Poga\u010dar reclaimed his title last year, Vingegaard was runner-up.",
      "\"We've raised the level of each other much higher and we push each other to the limit,\" Poga\u010dar said. \"I must say to him, big, big respect.\"",
      "Poga\u010dar has also won the Giro d'Italia, doing so last year to become the first cyclist to secure the Giro and Tour double in the same season since the late Marco Pantani in 1998.",
      "But Poga\u010dar has not yet won the Spanish Vuelta, whereas Anquetil, Hinault and Merckx won all three major races.",
      "When Poga\u010dar won the hilly fourth stage of this year's race, it was the 100th professional victory of his stellar career, all events combined.",
      "Poga\u010dar is also the world road race champion.",
      "His dominant victory at the Crit\u00e9rium continued his excellent form in the spring classics.",
      "After winning stage 4 of the Tour, Poga\u010dar added three more stage wins, including an emphatic uphill time trial.",
      "He would love to win the Paris-Roubaix classic and Milan San-Remo.",
      "The 259.2-kilometer, or 161-mile, Roubaix race is called \"The Hell of the North\" because of its dangerous cobblestone sections.",
      "Poga\u010dar's debut appearance at the one-day classic this year saw him seeking to become the first Tour champion to win it since Hinault in 1981. But powerful Dutch rider Mathieu van der Poel won it for the third straight year.",
      "Poga\u010dar has also yet to win Milan-San Remo, with Van der Poel also beating him there this year.",
      "Expect a fired-up Poga\u010dar next year at Roubaix and Milan-San Remo.",
      "But it's unclear whether he'll tackle the Vuelta.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Ted Carter, The Ohio State University president, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Columbus, Ohio and the president of The Ohio State University, Ted Carter. President Carter, welcome to 'Face The Nation.'",
      "OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT TED CARTER: Margaret, good to be with you on this Sunday from Columbus, Ohio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you very directly about these Trump administration claims that Ohio State is one of 60 universities that they deemed may have antisemitic practices and policies on campus. They say you're being investigated for them and for failing to end diversity policies, which could be a violation of the Civil Rights Act. What's the status of the probes? And how much pressure are you under?",
      "CARTER: To be quite frank, I'm not feeling a lot of pressure. Our understanding is we're on those lists because we had been previously on those lists under the Biden administration. We had been working with the Office of Civil Rights during that administration, and I think mostly that was a holdover. We are more than happy to talk to anybody from the Office of Civil Rights. We stand behind our actions. We know how we acted during the time of the protests. We never had an encampment here at Ohio State. We had some attempted we didn't allow that, and that's our long-standing rules on the Oval, which is the centerpiece of our campus. So I'm confident that as this plays out forward, that we're going to be just fine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration did publish Ohio State on the list of universities it's probing, and when you look at some of the issues they've raised at other places, you look at the result of freezing $3 billion in contracts at Harvard, $1 billion at Cornell, hundreds of millions of dollars of research funding at universities like Brown. Are you worried that your federal funds could be in jeopardy because of this?",
      "CARTER: Well, like I always say to my staff and my people, if we do the right things for the right reasons, everything will play out. And we've been doing it that way since I've been here since 1 January of 2024. Our research funding here at Ohio State has grown leaps and bounds over the last couple years. We're actually ranked number 11 in the country, ahead of Harvard, ahead of UNC Chapel Hill. Our revenues last year were $1.6 billion, 775 million of that came from the federal government, largely in NIH and NSF. As we sit here today, we've had some research grants impacted, but in the tens of millions of dollars, nothing like you're seeing at our Ivy League colleagues, and a lot of that is still in litigation. So I can't even tell you what the number of dollars that we may lose, but against the $1.6 billion it's pretty small, even though it's had some impact on some of our researchers. Unlike some of our counterparts, we have a significant research arm here, 14,000 faculty, post doc students, that do the research here. And it is significant. It goes way beyond the numbers and the dollars. It's what it's what it's doing for the community, what it's doing to extend and save and change lives, and what it's doing in agriculture, what it's doing for our police force. So what I would tell you is, at this moment today- even compared to where we were last year, we're still up in our research revenue about 7% from where we were last year, and we're- we're- we're proceeding to ask for more grants so that we can be a cancer free world here in our lifetime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we all hope for that future, sir, but you sound not to be concerned. But I did read that earlier when you had the buckeyes football team at the White House earlier in the year- and that was well covered, the Wall Street Journal said you told President Trump and Vice President Vance that quote, Ohio State is not the enemy. Why did you feel you had to say that? What did you mean?",
      "CARTER: Well, that might have been taken a little bit out of context. I kind of said that in jest, a little bit to the vice president when I had a chance to meet with him, and we had a long conversation. It was a very productive conversation. I won't go into all the details, but the point is, they know that Ohio State is doing the right things for the right reasons. I have said publicly that I believe the future of higher education is going to go through the large public land grant flagship institutions like the Ohio State University, I look at what we're doing today, and yes, like many other universities, there's a lot of concern about the future, what's coming out of the federal government, even what's coming out of our state government here in Ohio. But right now, I feel like we can still play defense, still understand how to adjust, kind of make sure that we're getting our bat on the ball, so to speak, in playing defense and protecting the plate, but we're also looking at how we can play offense. This is a time where institutions like Ohio State, we are very financially secure. We're actually looking to invest in ourselves. I just reflect on the graduation ceremony that we just had this past May. We produce about 18,000 In graduates a year. But at that ceremony, we graduated 12,400- all of them, by the way, got their diploma that day that they earned. And 90% of those students- 90% already had a job or they were going to another higher academic endeavor. And 70% of those undergraduate students are staying in the state of Ohio. 66% of the PhD and masters are staying in the state of Ohio. This is a wonderful workforce development program. That is what is raising the confidence of Ohioans and the American public in higher education, and that is starting to change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance was on this program a number of times- and one of them when he was still a senator. I spoke to him about his views on higher education. He's an Ohio State alum, undergrad, and he said he believes universities- he wasn't speaking of yours, but he said universities are 'controlled by left wing foundations,' and they're going in the wrong direction. Do you think he has a point?",
      "CARTER: I think higher education has started to build that reputation. And you can even see that in the Gallup-Lumina polls. You know, I was the superintendent of the Naval Academy from 2014 to 2019 you know, and that Gallup poll in 2015 said that nearly 60% of Americans had high confidence in post-secondary education. Now go ahead and just move that needle nine years forward, and yet, two in three Americans said they did not have confidence in higher education. That's a really bad mark. Americans were saying higher education costs too much. They were saying that the return on investment was difficult to prove. They even were saying some of the research being done may not impact them or their families. And yes, there was this conversation about the potential indoctrination of students, or that institutions were leaning very liberal. You know, we as administrators of higher education maybe ought to listen to the American public and say, maybe we haven't always gotten it right. So I'm here to say, here at the Ohio State University, we have paid attention to that. We are making efforts to make affordability a key issue for students. I mentioned that graduating class, 57% of those undergraduates left with zero debt. Zero debt. And the other 43% that left with debt was less than $24,000. And as we look across our hiring practices, I have 8,500 faculty. It is the best group of faculty I have ever worked with in my 12 years of leading in higher and that's saying quite a bit. I will tell you that as we hire the future, we're looking across the entire political spectrum for who we hire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On that point, you talked about what happened at the state level. The Republican controlled state legislature passed a law that eliminates the diversity programs, it does a number of things. But it also requires professors to post their course syllabus- syllabi online and their contact information. Do you think that this is meant to intimidate? Are you concerned? Is your faculty concerned about the focus on what they're doing?",
      "CARTER: Yes, I have talked to our faculty through our faculty senate and our leadership. There are some concerns, of course, because we've not done that before. We've got some time before we implement that. We have put all the pieces of Senate Bill 1 which is the General Assembly's bill here in the state of Ohio, into the implementation phase. We're still working through some of the details, but let me tell you the principles of academic freedom, what is taught in the classroom, the move towards scholarly pursuit, the research that we do here at Ohio State, those are things that we are still very passionate about, and I know that we're going to continue that work, and yet we'll still follow the law. We'll still follow some of the federal policies that are coming out. We're ready and prepared to do all of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To that point, you saw what Columbia University did this week in paying the $200 million fine to settle their dispute with the Trump administration, they also agreed to an outside monitor to assure the school complies with stamping out diversity programs. Does this precedent trouble you? I mean- would you take a deal like that?",
      "CARTER: Well, I can't speak to those institutions because I'm not leading them. I know both President Shipman and some of the other Ivy League presidents are colleagues, and they're having to do I think what I would call be in survival mode. Quite frankly, we're not going through any of that here at Ohio State, and nor do I think that we will. I mean, obviously we have a new state law. We're a public institution, so that means we're going to be transparent and put out everything that we do so the state of Ohio, the people and the entire country can see it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch to see what happens. Good luck to you, sir. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to French Foreign Minister, Jean\u2011No\u00ebl\u202fBarrot, who joins us this morning from Paris. Welcome to \"Face The Nation.\" I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?",
      "FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-NO\u00cbL BARROT: What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is- is- is now in the brink of a full catastrophe, and we've been working out, over the months, to try and relief the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in El-Arish in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza. So we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity offered by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered, and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?",
      "BARROT: We have, with the European Union, started tough discussions with the Israeli government, who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused bloodbath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions. We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects with 3400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political, a two state solution. But what we call for is, of course, the immediate cease-fire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas, that needs to be disarmed. And the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the UN in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first western UN Security Council member to do so, and the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it \"reckless.\" He says it serves Hamas propaganda, sets back peace, and considers it \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7.\" In your government's view, why is he wrong?",
      "BARROT: So the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two state solution process that was- that is today threatened, more threatened that it- it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone, because by- by- by recognizing, or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has- that will be co chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of the two state solution, and guarantee security guarantees for Israel. The two state solution is very simple, and I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back in this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and in security. This perspective is now threatened, and it's why the- the dynamic that we have initiated was so important, and this is why the conference that will take place in New York is such an important milestone. All these efforts are very, very complementary to the efforts that the U.S. have done in the region since the first term of President Trump. We share the short-term objective: immediate cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed. We share the long term objective: peace and stability in the region. And what we're doing, by bringing the Palestinian Authority leader to recognize seventh of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas- the disarm- for the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority, and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating, or recreating, the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward, and we are paving the way. We're paving the way for the future Abraham Accords that the U.S. administration might lead. So I see our effort as very complementary to the U.S. administration's effort, rather than substitutes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said, the U.S. Ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?",
      "BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary . We share the short term objective, cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas, and the long term objective, peace and stability in the region. In fact, we will welcome any further efforts led by the U.S. to implement the Abraham Accord logics. And what we're doing now with this very significant conference that will take place in New York will pave the way for such accords. But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics, a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the- or create an off ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza. Now the terms, we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords, but in the meantime, inaction is not an option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out though and said the French students were removed because they're Jewish. Have you determined whether this was indeed an act of antisemitism?",
      "BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has- to express our- our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in- in France, and we've made the same request. We'll keep following this situation as it unravels",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So too- too early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating.",
      "BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point. We've taken action as- as soon as we got, you know, as we got notice of what was happening, we offered support on location through our embassy to this group. We then reached out to the- the airline company, to the Spanish authorities, and we're now following the results of these investigations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings, Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon, and the world won't know?",
      "BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing, and alongside Germany and the UK, we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority in close coordination with U.S. authorities in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant rollback of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things has changed. Still then, and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement. We now want a more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also it's the ballistic component, as well as the regional destabilization activities that Iran has been conducting, unless we- unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the UK will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted 10 years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment, and on banking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?",
      "BARROT: We've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We- we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran, after the 12 day war, to go back to a discussion with the U.S., and we'll keep pressing them to do so, because indeed, if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, thank you very much for your time this morning."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is one of those appropriators we were just speaking about with the budget director. You just heard everything he laid out. There were no specifics on when these clawbacks could be coming, but they're on the table. He says they don't want to shut down. He didn't seem to say they want, you know, a continuing resolution. Do you know what's coming?",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Not really. The one thing we know, and you asked Russ Vought about this, was he says that the process is too bipartisan right now, meaning that they want to use this process just to ram through the agenda and the overall agenda we saw when they passed the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill, which was beautiful for billionaires, but not really for anybody else, which is to provide tax cuts for very wealthy people at the expense of everybody else. And I do want to say Margaret, I heard him deny that that bill increased the deficit and debt. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office just said it increased our debt by 3.5 trillion before added interest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's using an accounting gimmick in regard to the benchmark.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: As- and Republicans have called out this accounting gimmick, so when--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And it was accepted--",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, they sort of unilaterally imposed it, it was not accepted by Democrats, and it was a departure from previous efforts. But you know, then they come back and they say that they want to cut these important programs, NIH and other things to reduce the deficit, when, in fact, what they're doing it for is to help try finance those tax cuts for very wealthy people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's just heading us towards pretty unchartered territory and very unclear whether we will be able to avoid a government shutdown. Democrats are going to be blamed if there's a shutdown, don't you think? I mean, how do you sidestep this?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN : We certainly don't want a government shutdown. And I think everybody has heard Russ Vought say that they want a less bipartisan process. What that tells me is they're willing just to use their powers to try to shut down the government if they don't get their way. And what's ironic about this Margaret is you have Russ Vought calling for these deep cuts to education NIH, when he has asked for an increase for his OMB budget. He asked for a 13% increase for his OMB budget. He's asked for more people to join the OMB staff, while he's talking about RIFing people at other departments, like the Department of yeah- getting rid of firing people at the Department of Veterans Affairs and other important priorities. So it's hard to take the OMB Director seriously when he says that they didn't increase the debt and when he says he wants to cut things except for his own budget and staff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if they do head towards a government shutdown, why would there be any benefit unless it is to prioritize funding certain agencies and de-prioritizing other agencies. Well, that goes back to the executive, doesn't it, that authority?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, that ultimately, though you need, for example, four Republican senators to stand behind what he's calling for. And what they've called for is sort of just a double cross on the process, right? That's what the so-called rescissions, is just a Washington name for double cross. They support one thing, one day, President even signs off, and then they come back and say they changed their mind. And what we're asking is for four Republican senators just to publicly declare that when they say they're going to fund the Veterans Affairs Department that they actually mean it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That they won't later agree to claw that money back.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Exactly",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. So one of the things the Trump administration is clear and did get clawbacks of is foreign assistance. However, there's an exception. In June, the administration announced it would give $30 million to this Israeli-backed organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the GHF, I know you're familiar with it. It delivers aid through armed military contractors who stand behind the Israeli military in four designated zones that Gazans then have to get themselves to in order to receive the aid. The State Department says they're sending this money. Have they?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: To my knowledge, they have, although we've asked for the details, we haven't gotten them. In fact, just today, I'm sending a letter to Secretary Rubio, signed with 20 of my colleagues, calling for more information, but also calling for defunding this. American taxpayers should not be spending one penny to fund this private organization backed by mercenaries and by the IDF that has become a death trap. Over 1000 people have died from being shot and killed as starving people crowd to try to get food at just these four sites.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The- just to be clear here, the State Department says they're going to send $30 million. Reuters had reported that there were documents they obtained showing 7 million had already been sent to these, what you call, armed mercenaries. But the Trump administration says this is the best way, this is the only way, to keep money- to keep food out of the hands of Hamas, which financially benefits off reselling it to desperate starving people. Is there another way to feed desperate starving people?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Yes. And this is a- a big lie, the claim that when the UN organizations were delivering food to Palestinians civilians, that it was being systematically diverted to Hamas. I want to say loudly and clearly, this is a big lie. Trump is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The systematic part of that.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: The systematic, but that is their claim. They claim that essentially, large amounts of aid are being diverted to Hamas. What we know now, from testimony of American officials, Cindy McCain, and just this week, high level Israeli military officials, is that there's no evidence to support that. AID, USAID, just released a report saying there's no evidence to support that. So what the Netanyahu government did was scrap a delivery system that was working at delivering food and assistance in favor of this other effort. That was a pretext, this claim that Hamas was systematically diverting food. The real goal of this other effort is to use food as a weapon of war and population control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a violation of international law.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Yes, it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a human rights abuse. Senator Lindsey Graham was on \"Meet the Press\" this morning, and I want to ask for your reaction to something he said, because he was very strong in his words. He said, because the ceasefire talks fell apart, Israel is reassessing. He said to expect a full military effort by Israel to take Gaza down, quote, \"like we did in Tokyo and Berlin. They're going to do in Gaza what we did in Tokyo and Berlin, take the place by force, start over again, present a better future.\" The United States is a huge supporter of the State of Israel. Is there anything that could prevent what he says is about to happen?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, the United States should make very clear that it's unacceptable to use U.S. weapons to target or indiscriminately fire on civilians and civilian infrastructure. So--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because this sounds like an occupation.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, we also know, just this week, members of the Netanyahu coalition, in fact, government ministers, called for essentially erasing Gaza, and they said, it will become a Jewish state, statelet. And part of- so- this was one of the--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Netanyahu did say he didn't agree with his statement.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, here's the problem though, Margaret, we continually see that Netanyahu, at the end of the day, does cater to his most far right wing of his- of his government, people like Ben Gvir, people like Smotrich. That is what has allowed him to stay in power, and so at the end of the day, he takes the most extreme positions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\" Stay with us."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, welcome to 'Face The Nation.'",
      "DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET RUSSELL VOUGHT: Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much to get to with you. Let's start on what's going on with the Federal Reserve. If you take the president at his word, he does not intend to fire the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell- though he's still criticizing him. What is the President seeking in a successor when his term ends in May 2026?",
      "VOUGHT: Well, I think he's looking for a chairman that's not continually too late to the developments in the economic marketplace. And I think what we've seen with Chairman Powell, he was very late in the Biden administration to raise rates, to articulate the concern with regard to the Biden administration's spending. We all knew on the outside- even Larry Summers knew that we were going to have an issue with regard to inflation. And we saw, you know, recent, historical inflationary levels that we hadn't seen before. And now he is too late to lower inflation rates and so that is the kind of thing that we want to see in the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. And one of the reasons why is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --More of a focus on inflation?",
      "VOUGHT: --want an ability to recognize the developments in the economic marketplace. In this case, we want to be able to see lower rates and to have an ability to get the economy going. And one of the things we saw with Powell is that one of the reasons he was so late was because he didn't understand that inflation is largely a monetary phenomenon. He kept saying that inflation was transitory. He didn't tackle the problem, and now he's, again, too late, and you marry that with fiscal mismanagement at the Fed. It's a huge problem that we're trying to raise the country's awareness level with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as you know, the Fed is structured in a way where he doesn't have unilateral control. There's a governing board. Others weigh in. You did work on Project 2025, and we went back and looked at what they said in there about the Fed. As people may know, that's a Heritage Foundation product that got a lot of scrutiny during the campaign. the chapter on the Fed called for Congress to overhaul the Fed's focus and powers. Is that what you're looking to do in 2026?",
      "VOUGHT: I don't even know what that chapter says. All I know, in terms of the President, the President has run on an agenda. He's been very clear about that. All that we're doing is- in this administration is running on- is implementing his agenda.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't want to overhaul the Fed?",
      "VOUGHT: We want an economic system that works for the American people, that includes the Fed. And the President has been very clear that all he's asking from the Fed is lower interest rates, because he thinks it's important. When you look at across the across the globe, and you have countries lowering rates, and yet we don't see that in this country, given all of the positive economic indicators that we're seeing. And then we have fiscal mismanagement at the Fed with regard to this building renovation that I'm sure you will ask me about. Those are the kinds of things that we want to see from the Fed. This is not part of an existential issue with regard to the Federal Reserve.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed is indicating that they are trending towards a rate cut, though probably not as soon as this week. We mentioned those renovations at the top of the program, but I do want to ask about spending, or lack thereof, that the Trump administration is trying to direct. The White House said they will actually release the remaining $5 billion in education, funds that had been withheld from public schools until recently. There were 10 Republican senators very worried about this, and came out and said, your claim that the money goes to radical left wing programs was wrong. What changed your mind? What made you release this money?",
      "VOUGHT: Well, we had been going through a programmatic review with these funds. These are programs that, as an administration, we don't support. We've called for the elimination of them in the President's budget for precisely the reasons of which they flow to often left wing organizations. Thankfully, the President came into office, put an executive order that said it can't- these funds can't go to these types of initiatives. I'll just give you one example, English language acquisition was flowing to the New York school public education system to go into illegal immigration advocacy organizations. Preschool development grants doesn't actually go to preschoolers. It goes to the curriculum for putting CRT into the school system for people as young- children as young as four years old.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these senators said it goes to adult learners working to gain employment skills and after school programs.",
      "VOUGHT: And what we--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you deemed it is necessary?",
      "VOUGHT: We believe that it's important to get the money out right now, but we have taken an extended time frame to be able to make sure it doesn't go to the types of things that we saw under the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, you know, Senator Lindsey Graham told the Washington Post, the administration is looking at considering clawbacks from the Department of Education. This, you know, rescissions process. Is that the plan? Are you seeking to claw back education funds in a rescissions package? And if so, when are you sending that up?",
      "VOUGHT: We may be, we're always looking at potential rescission options. This is an- this is a set of funding that we wanted to make sure it got out. We did our programmatic review. We wanted to make sure it got out before the school year, even though it's multi-year funding. This is not funding that would expire at the end of this year. We are looking to do rescissions package. We're always gauging the extent to which the Congress is willing to participate in that process, and we're- be looking at a lot of different options along those lines, but certainly have nothing to announce here today. But we're thrilled that we had the first rescissions package in decades, and we've got the process moving again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no rescissions package before September?",
      "VOUGHT: Not here to say that. We're looking at all of our options, we will look at it and assess where the Hill is, what are the particular funding opportunities that we have, but nothing that we're going to announce today,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because some of the funds that do expire in September have also been held up on the health front. Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, 13 other Republicans, came out with a letter saying that you've been slow in releasing funds for the National Institute of Health for research into cardiovascular disease, cancer. Are those funds going to be released?",
      "VOUGHT: Again, we're going through the same process with the NIH that we did with the education. I mean--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's a time cost here.",
      "VOUGHT: --$2 million for injecting dogs with cocaine that the NIH spent money on, $75,000 for Harvard to study blowing lizards off of trees with leaf blowers. That's the kind of waste that we've seen at the NIH. And that's not even getting to the extent to which the NIH was weaponized against the American people over the last several years, with regard to funding gain of function research that caused the pandemic. We have a- we have an agency that needs dramatic overhaul. Thankfully, we have a great new head of it, but we're going to have to go line by line to make sure the NIH is funded properly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to release the cancer funding research? And the cardiovascular disease research funding?",
      "VOUGHT: We're going to continue- we're going to continue to go to the same process that we have gone through with regard to the Department of Education, that every one of these agencies--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before September, that money will be released?",
      "VOUGHT: --and we will release that funding when we are done with that review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, there's concern that you're withholding the money, hoping it just won't be spent. I mean, if you look at the White House budget, it does call for a 26% cut to HHS, $18 billion cut to NIH. Is this just a backdoor way to make those cuts happen?",
      "VOUGHT: Well, I don't want to speak to any specific program with regard to what we might do with regard to rescissions throughout the end of this fiscal year, but we certainly recognize that we have the ability and the executive tools to fund less than what Congress appropriated, and to use the tools that the Impoundment Control Act, a bill we're not- a law that we're not entirely thrilled with, gives us to- to send up rescissions towards the end of the fiscal year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So just for our viewers, the Impoundment Control Act is the legal mechanism for the President to use to delay or avoid spending funds appropriated by Congress. You seem to want to have an argument, or Democrats think you want to have an argument, over the power of the purse and who holds it. Do you want that to go to the Supreme Court?",
      "VOUGHT: Well, look, for 200 years, presidents have the ability to spend less than the congressional appropriations. No one would ever dispute, and our founders didn't dispute that Congress has the ability to set the appropriation ceiling. But 200 years of presidents, up until the 1970s had the ability to spend less, if they could find efficiencies, or if they could find waste that an agency was doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- That sounds like a yes?--",
      "VOUGHT:-- We lost that ability in the 1970s. The president ran on restoring that funding authority to the presidency, and it's vital. If you look at when we started to lose control fiscally, it was right around the time of the 1970s.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, many senators, Republican senators, are very uncomfortable with the tactics that you are using. Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins, that chair of the appropriations committee that is really running this- this funding process. And Senator Collins said you're pushing the limits of what the executive can do without the consent of the- of the legislative branch. You need to work with her to get your budget through. And in fact, you need to also be able to get Democrats on board to get to that 60-vote threshold to pass any kind of government funding to avoid a government shutdown at the end of September.",
      "VOUGHT: I have a great relationship with Senator Collins. I appreciate the work she does. She is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, so obviously we're going to have differences of opinion as to the extent to which these tools should be used. I mean, she had concerns with the rescissions package. The rescissions package was a vote that Congress had to make these cuts permanent--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Under- on a party line vote, she says, you want to go do these clawbacks. You do it through regular order, and you can put- you can put rescissions into an appropriations bill--",
      "VOUGHT: --But that was in fact, under regular order. That's the challenge, is the appropriators want to use all the rescissions, they want to put them in their bills, and then they want to spend higher on other programs. We act- we're $37 trillion in debt, Margaret. We actually need to reduce the deficit and have a dollar of cut go to $1 a deficit reduction. That's not what the appropriators want, and it's not news that the Trump administration is going to bring a paradigm shift to this town in terms of the business of spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You would acknowledge that you just added to the debt and to the deficit with this--",
      "VOUGHT: -- No, I would not acknowledge that. We reduced--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- The spending and tax bill that just passed?",
      "VOUGHT: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Where you lifted the debt ceiling.",
      "VOUGHT: The debt ceiling is an extension of the cap on what's needed to pay your previous bills. In terms of the bill itself, it is $400 billion in deficit reduction, $1.5 trillion in mandatory savings reforms, the biggest we've seen in history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to make sure I get to the rest of this before I let you go here, because we're running out of time. You said, a few weeks ago, that the appropriations process needs to be less bipartisan. You only have 53 Republicans. You do need Democrats to get on board, here. Is saying something like that intended to undermine negotiations? Do you actually want a government shutdown?",
      "VOUGHT: No, of course not. We want to extend the funding at the end of this fiscal year. We understand, from a math perspective, we're going to need Democrats to do that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what does less bipartisan mean?",
      "VOUGHT: Well, Margaret, the whole week, the Democrats were making the argument that if you pass the rescission bill, that you were undermining the bipartisan appropriations process. So, if Brian Schatz and every other appropriator is making that argument for a week--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee is who said that--",
      "VOUGHT: --you have to be able to respond and say, if you're going to call a rescissions package that you told us during the month of January and February that we should use to do less spending, if you're going to say that is undermining the bipartisan appropriations process, then maybe we should have a conversation about that. That is all it was meant to convey.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, the alternative to this process is another continuing resolution, these stop-gap measures. Are you open to that, because that would lock in Biden-era funding? What is your alternative here? If you want a less bipartisan process, how do you solve for this? Because it sounds like you're laying the predicate for a shutdown.",
      "VOUGHT: We are not laying the predicate for a shutdown. We are laying the predicate for the fact that the only thing that has worked in this town- the bipartisan appropriations process is broken. It leads to omnibus bills. We want to prevent an omnibus bill, and all options are on the table to be able to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All options are on the table?",
      "VOUGHT: We need an appropriations process that functions. We're going to go through the process. We're going to work with them, and we're going to do everything we possibly can to use that process to have cheaper results for the American taxpayer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm told we're out of time. Russell Vought, thank you for your time today."

    "story": [
      "A group of Democratic senators led by Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is urging the Trump administration to suspend American financial support for the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private food distribution organization that has been heavily criticized for the way it delivers food aid to Gazans and because so many have been killed trying to reach its distribution sites.",
      "The U.S. and Israel have advocated for the recently established GHF to replace the United Nations, which has built an extensive network of humanitarian workers inside Gaza over decades. Israel accuses the U.N. of bias and collusion with Hamas.",
      "In a letter sent to Secretary of State Marco Rubio Sunday, the 21 senators expressed \"grave\" concerns about \"the U.S. role in and financial support for the troubled GHF.\"",
      "\"We urge you to immediately cease all U.S. funding for GHF and resume support for the existing UN-led aid coordination mechanisms with enhanced oversight to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches civilians in need,\" the letter reads.",
      "The U.N. warns that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing increasingly dire as more Palestinians are in danger of starvation after a months-long Israeli blockade, and recent military operations complicated humanitarian efforts to help. The IDF claims there is no starvation.",
      "Van Hollen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as well as the powerful Appropriations Committee, told CBS News \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday, \"American taxpayers should not be spending one penny to fund this private organization backed by mercenaries and by the IDF that has become a death trap,\" noting that scores of Gazans were shot and killed as starving people crowded the GHF sites to obtain food.",
      "The letter focuses on a $30 million pledge from the State Department, announced last month, and on GHF's operations, particularly its use of armed contractors who stand behind IDF soldiers at food distribution sites in four designated military zones. Starving Gazans must travel to those areas, which is difficult for those too weak to move.",
      "\"Blurring the lines between delivery of aid and security operations shatters well-established norms that have governed distribution of humanitarian aid since the ratification of the Geneva Conventions in 1949,\" the letter says.",
      "U.S. allies have also been critical of the tactics used by the U.S. and Israeli-backed GHF.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot told Margaret Brennan Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" that Gaza is on the \"brink of food catastrophe\" and that France expects \"the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused [a] bloodbath in humanitarian health distribution lines in Gaza.\"",
      "U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Friday that a thousand Palestinians have been killed trying to access food since May 27.",
      "\"We hold video calls with our own humanitarians who are starving before our eyes,\" Guterres said. \"We will continue to speak out at every opportunity. But words don't feed hungry children.\"",
      "The U.N. human rights office said 1,054 people were killed while trying to obtain food since late May, and of those, 766 were killed while trying to reach sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The others were killed when gunfire erupted around U.N. convoys or aid sites.",
      "The group of senators led by Van Hollen are seeking answers about whether necessary oversight is being bypassed to benefit the GHF. Their letter cites public reports that the Trump administration authorized the funds under a \"priority directive,\" which meant it could avoid \"a comprehensive audit that is usually required for groups receiving USAID grants for the first time.\"",
      "The senators want to see the GHF's \"complete funding application and all supporting documentation\" and demand to know whether any statutory and regulatory requirements were waived.",
      "They also asked Rubio about the procurement mechanism that resulted in the $30 million in funding, and they want to know who signed the agreement, who might be liable for compliance violations and whether officials were aware of potential concerns raised by USAID about \"GHF's ability to protect Palestinians while delivering food aid.\"",
      "The State Department has not responded to a CBS News request for comment about the senators' letter. A department spokesperson said Friday that the funding has been allocated, but it has not yet been disbursed to GHF.",
      "On Saturday, amid international outcry, the Israel Defense Force began airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza and said it would establish humanitarian corridors to \"enable the safe movement of UN convoys delivering food and medicine to the population.\"",
      "The U.N. has said the airdrops are insufficient. Past airdrops have fallen on Gazans and killed them. Now the approximately 2 million people live in Gaza and have been herded into an even more limited zone that lacks extensive open space where air-dropped pallets can land.",
      "Israel's announcement came after extensive international outcry at images of starving children, and reports of death. Leaders in Europe, including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Fredreich Merz, coordinated Saturday by phone. A readout of the call released by the UK said the three leaders said the situation in Gaza is \"appalling\" and \"emphasized the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire, for Israel to lift all restrictions on aid and urgently provide those suffering in Gaza with the food they so desperately need.\"",
      "On Friday, two Jordanian officials said they were considering airdrops and the United Arab Emirates sent a 7,000-ton aid ship to Gaza's shores. But it has not been determined who will distribute the food once it arrives.",
      "The GHF says it has distributed more than 91 million meals to Gazans, but there have been almost daily reports of civilians being injured or killed as they try to reach one of the group's four distribution hubs, all located in southern Gaza.",
      "In an interview with BBC News this week, Anthony Aguliar, a U.S. Army veteran and former contractor for GHF, detailed what he says he saw on the ground behind IDF lines during humanitarian aid distribution, calling the operation \"amateur.\"",
      "\"I witnessed the Israeli Defense Forces shooting at the crowds of Palestinians. I witnessed the Israeli Defense Forces firing a main gun tank round from the Merkava tank into a crowd of people,\" Aguilar said. \"In my most frank assessment, I would say that they're criminal. In my entire career, I have never witnessed the level of brutality and use of indiscriminate and unnecessary force against a civilian population, an unarmed, starving population.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the GHF called Aguilar's claims \"materially false\" and said he had been terminated from his position for \"misconduct.\"",
      "The group has also been criticized by the U.N., which said GHF's tactics are neither adequate nor safe and make it more difficult for Gazans too weak to travel to military zones to secure food.",
      "Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, which provides support for Palestinian refugees, condemned the GHF in June, calling it \"an abomination\" and \"a death trap costing more lives than it saves.\"",
      "As the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorated further this week, the GHF and U.N. groups continued to blame each other.",
      "In several public statements and social media posts last week, GHF said the responsibility for the mass starvation lies with the U.N. for allowing their full aid trucks inside Gaza to sit untouched and undistributed.",
      "\"The U.N. cannot deliver this humanitarian aid to the people who need it most, and I'm not sure what the reason is,\" said GHF spokesperson Chapin Fay in a video posted to X, which showed him standing in front of U.N. aid trucks. \"Whether it's looters, safety or whether they're playing politics, it just doesn't matter. The people of Gaza deserve better.\"",
      "The executive chairman of GHF, Reverend Johnnie Moore, in an interview with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro this week accused the U.N. of \"playing politics with people's lives.\"",
      "\"They're actually basically a willful participant on the Hamas side of the negotiating table in the ceasefire negotiations, by refusing to distribute aid and spreading this narrative around the world that the people of Gaza are going to starve if Hamas doesn't, in effect, get its demands at the negotiating table,\" Moore said.",
      "The U.N. World Food Programme says hundreds of aid trucks are ready to move, but the approval needed from the Israeli military to transport and distribute that aid is not coming quickly enough. In a statement Friday, they said just over half of their requests to collect cargo were approved and convoys were typically delayed, sometimes up to nearly two days, awaiting permission to travel within Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, a UNICEF spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that their supplies of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food or RUTF \u2014 used for treating severely acutely malnourished children \u2014 is expected to run out in mid-August if more is not allowed into Gaza.",
      "\"We are now facing a dire situation that we are running out of therapeutic supplies,\" said Salim Oweis, a spokesperson for UNICEF in Amman, Jordan. \"That's really dangerous for children as they face hunger and malnutrition at the moment,\" he added.",
      "Oweis said UNICEF had only enough RUTF left to treat 3,000 children. In the first two weeks of July alone, UNICEF treated 5,000 children facing acute malnutrition in Gaza.",
      "The UNICEF spokesperson said the agency is unaware of whether GHF is distributing this type of specialized food and emphasized that it must be given to children after they are assessed by professional health workers to be suffering from acute malnutrition. GHF did not respond to CBS News when asked if the foundation also distributes specialized high-nutrient food for acutely malnourished children.",

      "While in Scotland, Mr. Trump is expected to discuss trade with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in a meeting the president said will \"probably\" take place at one of his golf properties. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Union Commission, said Friday that she and the U.S. president have agreed to meet in Scotland Sunday to discuss trade, and Mr. Trump confirmed the meeting upon his arrival in Scotland.

      "The U.S. had an $11.9 billion trade surplus with the U.K. in 2024, meaning the U.S. sold more goods to the U.K. than the U.K. sold to the U.S. But the U.S. had a trade deficit of roughly $235 billion with the EU last year.",
      "Before leaving for Scotland Friday, Mr. Trump said there's a \"50/50 chance, maybe less than that\" that his administration would reach a trade deal with the EU. Without a deal, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a whopping 30% tariff rate. The president has long been critical of the U.S.-EU trade relationship, claiming the U.S. has been treated unfairly.",

The case marked the first instance of the Supreme Court limiting a president's removal power by ruling that Roosevelt overstepped his authority. The court found that presidents could not dismiss FTC commissioners without a reason, such as malfeasance, before their seven-year terms ended, as outlined by Congress in the FTC Act.",

      "The report, based on an investigation launched by former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., was dated Sept. 18, 2020. At the time of the publication of the report, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was the chairman of the committee.",
      "The report has never before been released to the public and instead has remained highly classified within the intelligence community.",

      "\"Production of the ICA was subject to unusual directives from the President and senior political appointees, and particularly DCIA,\" the report states. \"The draft was not properly coordinated within CIA or the IC, ensuring it would be published without significant challenges to its conclusions.\"",
      "The committee found that the five CIA analysts and drafter \"rushed\" the ICA\u2019s production \"in order to publish two weeks before President-elect Trump was sworn-in.\"",
      "\"Hurried coordination and limited access to the draft reduced opportunities for the IC to discover misquoting of sources and other tradecraft concerns,\" the report states.",
      "The report states that Brennan \"ordered the post-election publication of 15 reports containing previously collected but unpublished intelligence, three of which were substandard \u2014 containing information that was unclear, of uncertain origin, potentially biased, or implausible \u2014 and those became foundational sources for the ICA judgements that Putin preferred Trump over Clinton.\"",

      "\"One scant, unclear, and unverifiable fragment of a sentence from one of the substandard reports constitutes the only classified information cited to suggest Putin \u2018aspired\u2019 to help Trump win,\" the report states, adding that the ICA \"ignored or selectively quoted reliable intelligence reports that challenged \u2014 and in some cases undermined \u2014 judgments that Putin sought to elect Trump.\"",
      "The report also states that the ICA \"failed to consider plausible alternative explanations of Putin\u2019s intentions indicated by reliable intelligence and observed Russian actions.\"",
      "The committee also found that two senior CIA officers warned Brennan that \"we don\u2019t have direct information that Putin wanted to get Trump elected.\"",
      "Despite those warnings, the Obama administration moved to publish the ICA.",

      "The report also includes intelligence from a longtime Putin confidant who explained to investigators that \"Putin told him he did not care who won the election,\" and that Putin \"had often outlined the weaknesses of both major candidates.\"",
      "The report also states that the ICA omitted context showing that the claim that Putin preferred Trump was \"implausible \u2014if not ridiculous.\"",

      "Instead of shutting down to recharge, the Walker S2 walks to a nearby swap station. When one battery starts to run low, the robot turns its torso, uses built-in tools on its arms and removes the drained battery. It then picks up a fresh one, plugs it in and gets back to work immediately. The entire process takes about three minutes. This system is similar to battery-swapping tech used in electric vehicles.

      "What is AI-powered ticket pricing?",
      "Traditional ticket pricing relies on fare \"buckets,\" where customers are grouped into categories based on when and how they book their tickets. Delta's AI ticket pricing system eliminates static rates, instead analyzing real-time information to calculate what a specific customer might be willing to spend on a seat for each particular flight.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein describes this as a reengineering of pricing, calling AI a\u00a0\"super analyst\" that works 24/7, seeking the optimal price for every traveler, every time. The airline has partnered with Fetcherr, which provides the underlying technology and also supports other global airlines.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why Delta wants personalized pricing",
      "Let's be honest. Airlines aren't adopting new, high-tech pricing systems to make less money. Delta says early results from AI-driven pricing show\u00a0\"amazingly favorable\" revenues. The airline believes that with AI, it can maximize profits by more precisely matching fares to what each passenger is willing to pay, based on a wide range of data inputs, from booking history to market trends.

      "How does this affect travelers?",
      "If you've ever wondered why airfare fluctuates every time you check, get ready for even more volatility. Delta's system could theoretically offer you a different price than someone else for the exact same seat, calculated in real time by AI.",
      "Pros: You might get special offers or early discounts if the AI needs to fill seats.",
      "Cons: It becomes much harder to know if you're getting a \"fair\" deal because the price shown is purely based on what AI thinks you'll pay, not what everyone else pays.",

      "\"There is no fare product Delta has ever used, is testing or plans to use that targets customers with individualized offers based on personal information or otherwise. A variety of market forces drive the dynamic pricing model that\u2019s been used in the global industry for decades, with new tech simply streamlining this process. Delta always complies with regulations around pricing and disclosures.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Industry impact and growing criticism over AI ticket pricing",
      "Delta's transparency regarding this shift has drawn national attention. Other airlines are already testing their own AI fare systems, and experts expect the industry to follow suit. Yet, privacy advocates and some lawmakers are voicing strong concerns. Critics argue that letting AI determine pricing behind the scenes is, in the words of Consumer Watchdog, like airlines\u00a0\"hacking our brains\" to find the maximum price we'll accept.",
      "The legal risks are still emerging. While price variation based on demand or timing is not new, using AI for ultra-personalized pricing raises uncomfortable questions about discrimination and fairness, especially since prior research suggests that poorer customers often receive the worst deals.",
      "Passengers sitting on a plane\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "You'll notice airfare feels even more personal now. Every time you search, the price could change just for you. Gone are the days of universal fares. The AI looks at your browsing, booking habits and timing. You may see special deals if Delta needs to fill your seat quickly. However, the price can also increase if it senses that you'll pay more.",
      "Shopping around is now a must. You can use a VPN if you want to outsmart the system by masking your location and IP address. A VPN helps prevent airlines from tracking your searches and adjusting prices based on your geographic region. Quick decisions might save you money, but waiting could result in a price increase. Privacy matters more than ever. The airline learns about your habits with every search you make. Your digital footprint affects your fares. In short, you have more power and more responsibility.

    "summary": "AI data centers are straining the power grid across 13 states, contributing to a $9 billion increase in electricity costs, and PJM customers face monthly bill increases of $25 or more.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier examines the U.S. power supply on 'Special Report.'",
      "If your electricity bill seems shockingly high, you're not imagining it. A big part of the spike is being driven by rising artificial intelligence electricity demand.",
      "PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States, says electricity usage is climbing sharply this summer. Some areas may see bills increase by as much as 20%. One of the main drivers behind this trend is the growing power consumption from data centers that support AI systems like ChatGPT and other generative tools.",

      "TRUMP ADMIN TACKLES URGENT ELECTRICAL GRID CRISIS AS AI SET TO DOUBLE DEMAND",
      "Electric transmission lines under strain from growing electricity demand\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the power grid is struggling to keep up",
      "PJM supplies electricity to 67 million customers across 13 states: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.",
      "In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers. Most of them are connected to the same grid that serves homes and businesses, which means the cost of that power growth is shared by everyone.",

      "AI and data centers are fueling a surge in energy use",
      "AI took off in 2023 when tools like ChatGPT became widely adopted. Since then, companies have been racing to build more infrastructure to keep up. PJM's territory now has the largest number of data centers in the world.",
      "Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.",
      "AI data center needing high energy demands\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why electricity prices are rising across the U.S.",
      "While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.",
      "Large solar farm generating renewable energy\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How AI is increasing your electric bill",
      "Even if you never use AI tools yourself, you are still likely paying for their growth. The cost of expanding the data center's power supply is spread across all grid users, including regular households.",
      "PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.",
      "To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.",
      "Tips to reduce your electricity bill",
      "Looking for ways to lower your electricity bill as prices surge? Here are some effective tips you can start using today:",
      "Unplug electronics and appliances when not in use to avoid phantom power drain.Upgrade to\u00a0smart thermostats and LED lighting for greater energy efficiency.Run major appliances (like washers and dishwashers) during off-peak hours.Consider adding weather stripping or insulation to block drafts and improve cooling/heating.Monitor your energy usage with\u00a0smart plugs or an electricity usage monitor for real-time feedback.",

      "AI electricity demand is growing faster than the grid can handle. As more data centers come online to power tools like ChatGPT, the strain is showing up on your utility bill. Without major upgrades to infrastructure or smarter energy policy, prices could keep climbing. The tech may be smart, but the cost of keeping it running is getting harder for everyone else to ignore.",

      "Their Spotify bio confirms that the group is a synthetic music project, guided by human creative direction but composed, voiced, and visualized using AI. This is a sign of where music may be headed.",

      "Platforms like Suno and Udio now allow users to generate original songs with just a few prompts. These tools handle everything, vocals, instruments, structure, with startling sophistication.",
      "The Velvet Sundown reportedly earned more than $34,000 in a single month from streaming platforms. And it's not alone. Other acts, such as Aventhis, a \"dark country\" musician with over 600,000 monthly listeners, are also believed to be powered by AI-generated content.",
      "This isn't happening in a studio with a team of producers. It's often just one person inputting text and outputting tracks. The barrier to entry is nearly gone. With a laptop and internet connection, anyone can create and distribute AI-generated songs on a massive scale.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The music industry responds with worry and legal action",
      "Major record labels are pushing back. Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Records have filed lawsuits against AI music platforms, accusing them of using copyrighted material without permission during the training process.",
      "At the same time, music creators and advocacy groups are demanding regulation. They want AI-generated tracks to be clearly labeled. They're also calling for updated copyright protections to prevent the misuse of human-created work during AI training.",
      "Streaming platforms are starting to acknowledge the issue. Deezer revealed that nearly one in five new uploads are entirely AI-generated. This trend is growing and reshaping the very idea of what it means to be a musician today.",

      "For emerging musicians, the rise of AI is deeply frustrating. Tilly Louise, an alternative pop artist based in the UK, has amassed millions of streams but still works a full-time job because her music doesn't generate enough income. Watching an AI-generated band pull in massive streaming numbers feels like being pushed aside by something that isn't even real.",

Music schools are also adapting. Educators are now teaching students how to utilize AI tools to enhance their creative process, rather than avoiding them.",
      "Still, even those who are optimistic about the technology admit that it could completely upend the music business. As AI-generated content becomes increasingly easy to produce, the competition for listener attention and streaming dollars will intensify.",

Whether it's rock, country, or pop, AI-generated songs are showing up in more playlists every day. The real question is not whether AI music is good enough. It's whether listeners will care that it wasn't made by a human. As technology improves and the lines between human and machine blur, that question will only get harder to answer.",

      "3. Report phishing emails: Use Outlook\u2019s built-in tools to report suspicious messages as phishing. You can also forward them to Microsoft at reportphishing@microsoft.com.",
      "4. Use strong antivirus software: Consider using strong antivirus software with built-in phishing and link protection to catch threats before they reach you. Stay vigilant when it comes to emails, phone calls, or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "6. Consider personal data removal services: After phishing attempts, your data may end up circulating among data brokers, increasing your risk of future scams and identity theft. Data removal services can help reduce the visibility of your personal information by submitting removal requests to dozens of people-search and broker sites. This limits how easily scammers and spammers can find and target you.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "These updates are just the beginning. Lucid is investing heavily in advanced driver-assistance and automation, with a clear focus on safety, comfort and long-term innovation.",
      "Lucid now joins the ranks of top hands-free driving systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving and GM's Super Cruise both offer hands-free driving on highways, though they differ in how they monitor driver attention and what roads they support. Ford's BlueCruise is another major option, available on a growing number of mapped highways. Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot goes a step further by letting drivers take their eyes off the road in certain traffic conditions, though it's only available in limited markets for now.",
      "The rearview of Lucid Air with hands-free software. (Lucid Motors)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're driving a car with advanced driver-assistance features, such as the Lucid Air or similar models, you're likely noticing real changes in your daily routine. With hands-off driving now available on select highways, those stressful commutes can feel a little easier. Sitting in stop-and-go traffic doesn't have to be such a chore anymore. Long road trips? Suddenly, they're much more comfortable. Many automakers, not just Lucid, are pushing out updates directly to your car, so you can access new tools without ever stepping into a service center.",
      "Safety is at the forefront with these new systems. As you drive, a network of sensors and smart software helps keep your lane changes smooth, your following distances steady and your ride free from abrupt surprises. These advances can give you peace of mind, but it's essential to remember that these systems don't drive for you. You still need to stay alert and keep your hands ready.",
      "With more cars using similar technology each year, the roads themselves are changing. There's hope that fewer accidents caused by distraction or delayed reactions will benefit not just tech-savvy drivers, but everyone out there. While these models, like the Lucid Air, showcase what's possible, the real transformation comes as driver-assistance features become the new normal in cars everywhere.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Lucid's new hands-free driving update puts it in direct competition with Tesla, GM, and other automakers working to change the way we drive. With DreamDrive Pro, Lucid shows that combining advanced hardware, in-house software, and frequent updates can deliver real capability. As more companies roll out similar systems, drivers are getting more options, and the convenience once reserved for luxury models is becoming more accessible.",

Antivirus software and firewalls cannot fix all of these problems. A VPN offers a powerful layer of protection by encrypting your traffic, hiding your activity, and making your connection truly private.

Even more impressive, when tested on nearly 85,000 people, EchoNext identified over 7,500 at high risk for undiagnosed SHD. A year later, researchers found that 73% of those who followed up with echocardiograms were indeed diagnosed with SHD, a rate far above average. These groundbreaking results were published in Nature, one of the world's most respected scientific journals. That's not just a better test. That's a potential lifesaver.",

      "Why this matters now more than ever",
      "Millions walk around every day with SHD and have no idea. They skip heart screenings because nothing feels wrong. Even when they do get an ECG, subtle warning signs can slip by unnoticed. EchoNext doesn't miss them. And it doesn't get tired or distracted. This isn't about replacing doctors. Iit's about giving them a powerful new tool to catch what humans alone can't.",

      "The world's first hybrid solar cargo ship has just launched in Germany, marking a major milestone for sustainable shipping. The Blue Marlin uses advanced solar technology not only to power its onboard systems but also to drive its main propulsion, setting a new standard for eco-friendly cargo transport. By combining solar panels with a diesel-electric system, this vessel is paving the way for cleaner, more efficient movement of goods along Germany's waterways.",

      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "How solar power moves the Blue Marlin",
      "The Blue Marlin uses 192 solar panels, which can generate up to 35 kilowatts in ideal conditions. That\u2019s enough to charge over 1,400 smartphones at the same time. Wattlab designed the solar system to supply electricity directly to the ship\u2019s propulsion system. Unlike earlier vessels, the Blue Marlin uses solar energy for movement, not just for basic onboard functions. When conditions allow, the ship can run on solar power alone for short trips. For example, it can do this when traveling downstream with a light load.",
      "Hybrid technology for reliable shipping",
      "The Blue Marlin also relies on four diesel generators. This hybrid setup lets the vessel switch between solar and diesel-electric power as needed. As a result, the ship stays reliable in any weather. An automated energy management system controls how power is distributed. This system sends energy exactly where it is needed. It also reduces unnecessary fuel use, which helps the environment. In addition, the ship uses a technique called peak shaving. During high energy demand, it draws on solar and battery reserves instead of starting extra generators. This strategy lowers emissions and keeps the operation smooth.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "The Blue Martin is well suited for Germany\u2019s waterways",
      "The Blue Marlin measures approximately 282 feet in length and 31 feet in width, with a shallow draft of just 3 feet 7 inches, making it well suited for Germany's canal network. Its hull was constructed in Romania and later outfitted with systems in the Netherlands. Today, the fully completed vessel operates out of Cologne, Germany. SEAFAR remote navigation technology is another feature; this system allows remote-controlled operation on select routes, improving safety and reducing the workload for the crew.",
      "The Blue Marlin\u2019s environmental impact and design benefits",
      "Each year, the Blue Marlin's solar array can generate up to 37,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity. This output helps prevent about 79,000 pounds of CO\u2082 emissions annually. Thanks to its modular design, the ship can connect with push barges and carry up to 3,430 short tons of bulk goods efficiently. Its hybrid diesel-electric system is also designed to run on cleaner fuels in the future, making it adaptable as greener energy options become more available.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Blue Marlin is more than a technological showcase. By fully integrating solar power with intelligent hybrid systems, it proves that performance and environmental responsibility can work together. This vessel stands as a practical example of cleaner shipping solutions. It offers lessons and inspiration for the future of cargo transport around the world.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft announces the first handheld Xbox device, and it\u2019s primed to take on Nintendo\u2019s best-selling Switch 2.",
      "Windows 11 has had poor adoption, with many people sticking to the good old Windows 10. Microsoft has been pushing users to upgrade, threatening to end software support and warning about potential cybersecurity risks. But Windows 11 isn\u2019t exactly the best OS to come out of Redmond. Even if it were, many people simply can\u2019t upgrade because of its steep system requirements.",
      "In fact, it took Windows 11 nearly four years after its 2021 debut to finally surpass its predecessor in user numbers. Now that Windows 10 is being phased out, many users, especially those with older PCs that don't meet the hardware requirements, are understandably concerned. Tony from Wisconsin recently asked us the same thing:",
      "\"I heard that Microsoft will stop providing security patches for Windows 10 after October. My laptop can't be upgraded to Windows 11 because the CPU is too old. Since I'm not tech-savvy and don't feel comfortable replacing the CPU (nor do I want to), I'm wondering if I have a good antivirus program, do I still need to upgrade? Or will my system still be vulnerable to hackers and viruses?\"",
      "I understand your concern, Tony. Sticking with an unsupported OS brings security risks. Security researchers warn that unsupported systems, such as Windows 10, will become increasingly attractive targets for hackers. Hackers often reverse-engineer patches released for newer systems like Windows 11 to find similar flaws in older ones like Windows 10. With no more fixes coming, those vulnerabilities remain wide open, making unsupported systems a tempting target.",

      "According to Statcounter, Windows 11 has finally overtaken Windows 10 in terms of desktop and laptop usage as of early July. The newer OS now accounts for 52 percent of all Windows installations, up sharply from just under 48 percent in June. In the same period, Windows 10 dropped from 53.2 percent to 44.6 percent. Interestingly, Windows 7 still holds a small but notable presence, with 2.35 percent of users refusing to let it go.",
      "This shift comes nearly four years after Microsoft announced Windows 11 in June 2021. From the start, it was criticized for strict hardware rules. It required a TPM 2.0 chip and newer processors. Many functional PCs were left unable to upgrade.\u00a0 The operating system also introduced a revamped user interface that some users found unnecessary or confusing, leading to a slow adoption rate.",
      "A man typing on a Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens when Windows 10 support ends in 2025? Here's what you need to know",
      "Windows 10 is reaching the end of its official support on October 14, 2025. That means Microsoft will stop releasing new features and routine security updates for the general public. For most users, this marks the end of the road, unless they take specific steps to keep receiving updates.",
      "To extend security updates beyond this deadline, Microsoft is offering a program called Extended Security Updates (ESU). Normally, this would cost $30 per year for personal users. However, Microsoft is making the first year free if you back up your PC using the Windows Backup app and sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "Microsoft hasn't disclosed pricing beyond the first year, so it's unclear whether the $30/year rate will remain the same in 2026 and 2027.",
      "If you don't opt into either of those methods, you'll need to pay the $30 to continue receiving critical patches through October 2026. This is especially relevant for those who can't upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations.",
      "Even after general support ends, Microsoft will keep updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows 10 until October 2028. So while full system security updates will stop for most, basic malware protection will continue for a few more years.",
      "Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can't upgrade to Windows 11? 8 Safe alternatives for Windows 10 users in 2025",
      "You can continue using Windows 10 until October 14, 2025, with full access to regular security and stability updates. After that, you can extend protection by enrolling in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates program. The first year is free if you use the Windows Backup app to sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "If your computer meets the hardware requirements for Windows 11, upgrading is the easiest long-term solution. You\u2019ll get access to ongoing feature updates, improved security, and long-term support through at least 2031.",
      "Google offers a free operating system called ChromeOS Flex, designed for older PCs and laptops. It\u2019s based on the same system used in Chromebooks and focuses on speed, simplicity, and security. However, it doesn\u2019t support Android apps or some hardware features like fingerprint readers and may not work for tasks like video editing or gaming.. This can be a great option if you mostly use web apps like Gmail, Google Docs, or Zoom.",
      "Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Zorin OS provide a stable and user-friendly experience, especially for those coming from Windows. You can use them on older hardware without any licensing fees, and they come with access to thousands of free applications. While there may be a bit of a learning curve, many users find Linux reliable and surprisingly easy to adapt to for everyday tasks like browsing, writing, and media playback.",
      "If your current system can\u2019t handle Windows 11 and you are not interested in alternatives like ChromeOS or Linux, investing in a new computer may be the most straightforward path. New devices come with Windows 11 pre-installed and are built to support it fully.

You could also switch to a different operating system. Another option is investing in stronger security tools. And be on alert: as Windows 10\u2019s end-of-life nears, scammers will take advantage.

      "We all know staying hydrated is important, but most of us don't actually track how much water we need. The signs of dehydration, like dizziness, fatigue, or confusion, can creep in before you even realize you're in trouble. By the time you feel thirsty, you're already behind. That's what makes the new wearable hydration sensor so valuable. Instead of guessing, this device provides real-time data, allowing you to stay ahead of dehydration, rather than just react to it.",

      "Single-side electrode configuration setup using hydration bioimpedance sensor. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "How the wearable hydration sensor works",
      "Developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, the sensor is designed to detect early signs of dehydration using a method called bioimpedance. This method sends a small, painless electrical current through your bicep and measures how easily that current flows through your tissue. Because water is a good conductor of electricity, well-hydrated tissue lets the current pass easily. When you're dehydrated, your tissues resist the current, and the sensor detects that. The sensor connects wirelessly to a smartphone app, delivering instant feedback about your hydration level. You don't have to stop what you're doing or wait for lab results. The data is continuous and always available.",
      "Wearable hydration sensor benefits for workouts, jobs, and health",
      "This isn't just cool tech, it's practical. For athletes pushing through workouts in the heat, the sensor could help them avoid fatigue or cramping. For firefighters or police officers wearing heavy gear in scorching temperatures, it offers a way to stay safe on the job. Even office workers who forget to drink water during long meetings could benefit from a reminder when their hydration levels drop. The researchers believe the wearable hydration sensor could also play a major role in health care. Patients with kidney problems or cardiovascular issues often need to monitor hydration closely. Until now, that meant invasive tests or relying on symptoms. This sensor could make hydration tracking simple, accurate, and non-invasive.",
      "The science behind the hydration sensor",
      "To make sure the sensor really works, the research team ran controlled experiments. They had participants take a diuretic to promote fluid loss and tracked hydration using the sensor. At the same time, they collected urine samples to confirm results. The sensor's data closely matched the chemical markers in the samples. That means the technology is not only accurate, but it can also be trusted even during normal daily activities like walking or working. Study co-author Matija Jankovic explained that arm bioimpedance was highly sensitive to changes in hydration. It also aligned with whole-body hydration, making it a reliable alternative to traditional testing.",
      "Rigid PCB and commercial gel electrode system. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "Traditional hydration tests fall short",
      "Standard ways of checking hydration, like urine tests or blood work, are time-consuming and not practical for everyday use. Some commercial tools already exist, but they tend to be bulky or require users to stay in one spot. They're just not built for real life. That's where this sensor has the edge. It's compact, portable, and constantly running in the background. It works while you move, exercise, or even just sit at your desk.",
      "What's next for hydration tracking",
      "Right now, the sensor tracks relative changes in hydration, which is a powerful tool on its own. But the research team wants to take it further. They plan to collect data from a larger population to create baseline values for absolute hydration levels. This step would make the device even more accurate and personal. They're also exploring new wearable designs, such as breathable e-tattoos and sweat-wicking sensors, that could offer better comfort and longer wear. Future models might track hydration in other areas of the body, like the forearm or thigh. The team is optimistic that these innovations will make hydration tracking even more seamless and accessible. Lead researcher Nanshu Lu, who has worked on similar wearable health tech in the past, says this is only the beginning. Her vision is to bring simple, real-time hydration tracking to everyone, no matter their lifestyle or profession.",
      "A woman sweating during a workout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Staying hydrated just got a whole lot easier. With a wearable hydration sensor, you no longer have to rely on guesswork or vague reminders to drink water. Whether you're powering through a workout, focused on a demanding job, or just caught up in a busy day, this device keeps tabs on your hydration status in real time. That means you get clear, instant feedback-before dehydration slows you down.",
      "While this technology is still in the research and development phase, the early results are promising. It's not yet available to the public, but the groundwork is in place. Once it moves into production, this kind of real-time hydration tracking could become a part of daily life, helping you stay healthier, more alert, and ahead of the curve.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Dehydration isn't always obvious, but it can quickly become serious. The wearable hydration sensor puts the power to monitor your health back in your hands. It's accurate, non-invasive, and built for daily life. Whether you're training for a marathon or just trying to stay sharp at work, knowing your hydration status in real time could make all the difference.",

      "What is the coffee ring effect, and why does it matter in science?",
      "Ever wondered why spilled coffee, wine or tea dries in a ring rather than evenly? This common pattern is known as the \"coffee ring effect.\" The phenomenon occurs because of the liquid's surface tension. As the drop begins to dry, water at the edges evaporates more quickly since that area is thinner. To keep up, liquid from the center flows outward, carrying tiny particles with it. Once the drop is completely dry, these particles settle along the edge, creating the signature ring stain you see on tables and countertops every day.",

Researchers at UC Berkeley transformed this everyday nuisance into a powerful new at-home diagnostic test. This innovative test can identify diseases like COVID-19, prostate cancer and sepsis with remarkable accuracy. In fact, it is up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests. Even better, it delivers results in just twelve minutes, depending on the test.",
      "The idea began with Kamyar Behrouzi, a former Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. While developing a COVID-19 biosensor in 2020, he noticed that virus particles, much like coffee particles, tend to gather at the edge of a droplet. By using this natural effect, the researchers designed a test that captures and concentrates disease markers, making detection much easier. Thanks to this stain-inspired science, fast and reliable testing is now possible right at home.",

      "How this coffee-inspired test detects COVID-19, sepsis, and more",
      "So, how does this innovative test actually work? First, you place a small sample from your nose or cheek onto a special membrane. As the sample dries, disease proteins concentrate at the edges to form a visible ring. Next, you add a second droplet containing light-reactive particles. If certain disease biomarkers are present, these nanoparticles light up when exposed to light. You can see positive results with the naked eye in some cases, or verify them more accurately using a special AI-powered smartphone app.",
      "This rapid test does more than detect COVID-19. It can also identify early signs of sepsis, a life-threatening infection that needs quick treatment. To make home testing accessible, the UC Berkeley team even created a 3D-printed prototype for easy use on your kitchen counter. According to professor Liwei Lin, this innovative approach could transform regular health screening, with no lab visit required.",

      "A man kicking a ball while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "How the e-OPRA bionic knee for amputees works",
      "The tech is called e-OPRA (Enhanced Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees). It involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthetic limb. This rod becomes the foundation of a new kind of interface between the body and machine. But it doesn't stop there.",
      "Using a specialized surgical technique known as Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface (AMI), muscles are reconnected in functional pairs. These muscles \"talk\" to each other, sending signals to the robotic controller, which calculates exactly how the knee should move, mirroring how a real leg works.",
      "Natural movement restored with the bionic knee for amputees",

      "Why the bionic knee for amputees is a major breakthrough",
      "Traditional socket-based prosthetics can be uncomfortable, unstable, and prone to infections. They often feel foreign, like a tool strapped to the body rather than a part of it. The bionic knee bypasses the socket altogether. By connecting directly to bone and muscle, it improves load-bearing, reduces skin problems, and most importantly, restores a sense of control. And control isn't just physical, it's emotional and psychological. Patients using the e-OPRA system reported a greater sense of agency and body ownership than those with traditional or partially-integrated prosthetics.",

      "Professor Hugh Herr isn't just leading the research; he's living it. After losing both legs below the knee to frostbite in his teens, he returned to mountain climbing and dedicated his career to advancing prosthetic technology. His personal journey powers a lab at MIT that continues to push the boundaries of biomechatronics. And now, that journey may change the lives of above-the-knee amputees worldwide.",

      "Photo showing fentanyl pills seized at the U.S. border. (Elizabeth Denis/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID detects drugs faster than swab tests",
      "This portable air scanner, created at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is being brought to market by California-based instrument maker BaySpec. The device works by pulling in air and identifying molecules in real time using a miniature mass spectrometer.",
      "Unlike traditional swab tests that take five to thirty minutes, VaporID detects fentanyl in seconds, even at levels as low as six parts per trillion. That's like spotting a single pine needle in an entire forest.",
      "Why drug dogs may soon be outmatched by VaporID",
      "For decades, trained canines have been the gold standard at ports of entry. But dogs have limits; they tire, need handlers, and can't be reprogrammed with software updates. VaporID, on the other hand, never needs a nap. It can detect not only known drugs but also fentanyl analogs, lab-made variants designed to skirt detection.",
      "The system's cutting-edge design includes an atmospheric flow tube that allows tiny drug molecules more time to interact with charged ions. That chemical dance dramatically boosts sensitivity, making it possible to detect even the most elusive threats.",

      "Illustration of the action within the atmospheric flow tube that is a key to the detection of trace levels of fentanyl. (Sara Levine/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID works: Air, ions, and instant answers",
      "VaporID weighs about 40 pounds and draws in ambient air like a miniature vacuum. Suspicious molecules are filtered, tagged with electrically charged ions, and passed into a tiny mass spectrometer. Only the relevant particles make it through. This process filters out background interfering vapors from things like perfumes or cleaning agents, giving border agents a clear, accurate, and immediate read on potentially dangerous substances.",
      "What VaporID means for border security",
      "If deployed widely, VaporID could revolutionize how U.S. Customs and Border Protection detects narcotics and explosives. Its fast, hands-free scanning would help agents screen vehicles, cargo, luggage, and even people, without relying solely on canine units or invasive sampling.",
      "The device's sensitivity also opens doors for use beyond borders. The Department of Homeland Security is already working with PNNL and BaySpec to adapt the technology for mail screening, airport baggage checks, and large-scale cargo inspections.",
      "For materials like TNT (trinitrotoluene) and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), both powerful explosives that release very few molecules into the air, VaporID's ultra-sensitive detection provides a level of protection that's long been out of reach with current methods.",
      "Chemist Elizabeth Denis uses the PNNL system to check a substance in the laboratory. (Andrea Starr/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "VaporID\u2019s role in combating drug and explosive smuggling",
      "The U.S. is facing a deadly influx of synthetic opioids. According to the CDC, over 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2024, including approximately 48,400 deaths linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Fast, contactless detection at ports of entry could help choke off the supply chain before these deadly substances ever hit the streets. And in an era of rising geopolitical tensions, having a portable scanner that can also detect explosives could be a critical layer in national defense.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology doesn\u2019t just assist border agents anymore; it\u2019s starting to outperform their most trusted tools. VaporID brings speed, precision, and reliability to a job where seconds count. While drug-sniffing dogs have served well, this portable air scanner may soon lead the front line in detecting threats. As agencies prepare to roll out the system, one thing is clear. The future of border security doesn\u2019t bark. It beeps.",

We have a policy that says you can\u2019t fly during Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR). We have a policy that says you can\u2019t fly in restricted airspace.

      "\"I would argue we have no awareness of the airspace whatsoever,\" Walker told Fox News Digital. \"If you don\u2019t have awareness, you cannot have control of your airspace.

      "Jimmy Hoffa threatened to kick the mob out of the Teamsters, so the Detroit mafia and Teamsters president Frank Fitzsimmons killed him, says his son. (Fox Nation)",
      "Through the years, there have been various claims about where Hoffa was killed.",
      "One possibility was a local catering hall called the Raleigh House, which the FBI investigated and found no evidence tying it to the disappearance. Another location seems more likely, a mansion on a secluded knoll in Bloomfield Hills. The home was owned at the time by Detroit mob solider Carlo Licata, who was found shot to death on his bed in the house on July 30, 1981...exactly six years to the day from when Hoffa had vanished.",
      "\"I believe his death was a retaliation for what he knew about Jimmy Hoffa\u2019s murder,\" said Licata's cousin, Anne Licata-Solaas. \"He was going to expose it.\"",
      "Licata-Solaas has written a book about her family, \"The Scent of Lemons,\" that lays out the scenario that Carlo was murdered to keep him quiet about what happened to Hoffa.",
      "Authorities ruled Licata's death a \"suicide,\" and determined that Licata died instantly from a bullet to his heart. But Licata-Solaas doesn't buy it. The gun was found seven feet from Licata's body, resting neatly on his dresser chest of drawers.",
      "Fox Nation asked renowned Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Baden to review Licata's autopsy and police report. He doesn't think Licata killed himself either.",
      "\"The forensic evidence is that this is a homicide, not a suicide,\" said Baden. \"Someone else did this.\"",
      "Baden cites, among other reasons, that the gun was held a few inches away from Licata's body, there was no gunpowder residue on his hands which would have been left by a .357 magnum, and Licata would not have been able to die and then stand up to place the gun on the far side of the room and then lie down again.",
      "Investigators say Licata's house was the logical place to kill Jimmy Hoffa. It had a secluded garage that was hidden from the street, so the car with Hoffa could have pulled in without being noticed.",
      "Investigators believe Hoffa was murdered in this house, then owned by mobster Carlo Licata. His cousin tells Fox Nation that he was murdered in his bedroom exactly six years later because he was going to tell all about Hoffa\u2019s killing. (Fox Nation)",

      "The FBI last dug in 2022 under the Pulaski Skyway in Jersey City, N.J., at the site of an old mob-connected waste site, known as Moscato's dump. It was claimed that Hoffa was buried there in a barrel. The search came up empty.",
      "\"The answer is incredibly simple. Jimmy Hoffa never left Detroit,\" said Burnstein. \"This was something that probably happened in a 30 to 60-minute window on the afternoon of July 30, 1975. It happened in probably a 15-mile radius of where he was murdered.\"",

      "Gatling says Kamiya is aiming for a return to traditional cultural values, while also lowering taxes and increasing food self-sufficiency, which is currently the lowest rate of all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nations at 38%.",

      "Another possible friction point in the future might be Sanseit\u014d\u2019s desire to turn the nation\u2019s farmers into public sector employees, Gatling admitted. \"The agriculture bloc is one of the most powerful in the LDP,\" he explained. \"I\u2019m not sure how many of the farmers want to be public sector employees.\"",
      "While he says that it is too early to determine the future of Sanseit\u014d in Japanese politics, Gatling said Kamiya has stated he is not \"interested in building a coalition government.\" Gatling believes the party\u2019s future will hinge on preparations for subsequent elections and demonstrating that \"they have reasonable policies.\"",
      "Chang said Sanseit\u014d\u2019s win was a loss for the LDP, which he says has \"been adrift\" since Abe\u2019s 2020 resignation and subsequent 2022 assassination. Current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba \"is weak and unpopular,\" and the LDP now finds itself \"in the minority in both houses of the Diet for the first time since the party was formed in 1955,\" Chang said. \"Ishiba is naturally catching the blame.\"",

      "While the political waves leave Japan \"rudderless,\" Chang said to \"expect Sanseit\u014d to only get stronger, which means Japan will turn inward. Around the world, societies have had enough of large foreign populations that do not assimilate, so we should not be surprised that Kamiya will become even more influential.",
      "\"Change occurs slowly in Japan until it happens all at once. Japan is now on the verge of an all-at-once moment,\" Chang said.",

      "\"To that end the global terror threat index scores for several African countries have come to exceed those of traditional Middle Eastern terror staples.

      "\"A third pillar of the strategy is that Iran has deepened diplomatic and economic cooperation ties with scores of African governments and business organizations to win trade and investment deals that help it evade global sanctions, as well as securing the diplomatic support of African governments on global fora such as the U.N., for measures ranging from its nuclear weapons program to its investment in proxy forces that threaten Israel.",

    "story": [
      "Three Venezuelan men told NBC News they experienced physical and psychological torture, including one man\u2019s allegation that he was sexually assaulted, after the Trump administration sent them to a notorious prison in El Salvador.",
      "The men were held for four months in the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a Salvadoran megaprison known for its harsh conditions and reported abuse. The allegations included beatings that left bruises and cuts, psychological abuse and the denial of necessities such as food or bathroom access.",
      "The Trump administration sent about 250 Venezuelan men to CECOT in March and has accused them of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Many of the men and some of their families and attorneys have denied the claim. The men were released and flown to Venezuela on July 18 as part of a prisoner swap with the United States.",
      "Andry Hernandez Romero, a 32-year-old gay asylum-seeker from Venezuela, told NBC News that one day during his imprisonment he was taken to solitary confinement, where prison staff \u201cmade me kneel, perform oral sex on one person, while the others groped me and touched my private parts\u201d and \u201cstroked me with their batons.\u201d",
      "He said he could not identify the guards because their faces were covered and the room did not have a lightbulb, with only a small amount of light coming in through a hole in the ceiling.",
      "Hernandez said the incident left him devastated.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to eat. I didn\u2019t want to do absolutely anything,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThe only thing I did was stay laying down, look at the toilet, remember my family, asking myself a million questions.\u201d",
      "Another detainee who spoke to NBC News, Jerce Reyes, said Hernandez told him after they were released that he was sexually abused by CECOT staff. Hernandez also said on Venezuelan state media that he was sexually abused while in CECOT.",
      "\u201cHe told us that when we arrived in Venezuela, that he suffered abuse at the hands of guards there in El Salvador,\u201d said Reyes, referring to Hernandez\u2019s account of sexual abuse.",
      "Hernandez said he was unaware of any formal system at CECOT through which he could report the alleged abuse and that if detainees tried to complain to superiors at the prison, they would often be subjected to beatings by guards.",
      "The Salvadoran government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hernandez\u2019s sexual assault allegations and claims from other Venezuelan men that they were physically and psychologically abused in the prison. The government has previously said it observes safety and order standards, and the director of CECOT told CNN that \u201cthe whole operation is based on strict respect for human rights.\u201d In a statement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security referred NBC News to the Salvadoran government for comment because the Venezuelan men were \u201cnot U.S. citizens or under U.S. jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "When asked whether the U.S. government would continue to send people to CECOT, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, \u201cwhether it is CECOT, Alligator Alcatraz, Guantanamo Bay or another detention facility, these dangerous criminals will not be allowed to terrorize U.S. citizens.\u201d",
      "The statement said that President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u201care using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens off our streets and out of our country. Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u2018You will not be leaving here\u2019",
      "Hernandez and others said they were repeatedly beaten by prison officials.",
      "\u201cOur daily bread there as Venezuelans were beatings, threats. For whatever circumstance,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIf you answer an official, they hit you. ... If you talk, they hit you.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery time they went to hit a large group outside, they would put us in the required position so we couldn\u2019t see. And to hear the moans, to hear how they were hitting the people was also very heavy.\u201d",
      "Another detainee, Andry Blanco Bonilla, 40, said he and the other Venezuelans faced verbal, psychological and physical abuse from the day they entered CECOT.",
      "\u201cThere were so many moments of anguish and terror,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cI feared for my life.\u201d",
      "Blanco Bonilla said that when they first arrived at CECOT, the men were shackled so tightly at the ankles that walking \u201cwould give us cuts and bruises.\u201d He said the guards denied them food and access to bathrooms or showers as punishment.",
      "Blanco Bonilla, who had gone to the U.S. to seek asylum, said he would never forget the words of a prison official who told the detainees, \u201cWelcome to CECOT. Welcome to hell.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou will not be leaving here. Your days are over,\u201d the official said, according to Blanco Bonilla.",
      "The detainees would suffer beatings as the guards saw fit, he said.",
      "\u201cThey tried to avoid hitting our faces. They kicked us in the back or ribs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they made us get on our knees, they would step on our toes with their boots. They hit us with batons, they hit us on the head.\u201d",
      "After a beating, Blanco Bonilla said he would be brought by guards to a prison doctor, who would say to him, \u201cYou hit yourself. How did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "When he tried to tell the doctor that he was beaten by prison staff, a guard would hit him with a baton in the back, Blanco Bonilla said. The doctor would then ask him again, \u201cHow did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized that if I didn\u2019t tell them what they wanted, they would keep hitting me,\u201d he said, adding that the doctor would then make a false report about the incident.",
      "\u2018We are only migrants\u2019",
      "Reyes, 36, said one of hardest moments for him was when a prison official \u201cencouraged us to commit suicide\u201d and told him \u201cthis is how your whole nightmare ends.\u201d",
      "\u201cI did think about committing suicide at some point. But I thought about my two daughters, I thought about my family,\u201d he said about his two children, ages 3 and 6.",
      "Reyes said there were days when \u201cwe woke up and all said to ourselves, \u2018We aren\u2019t getting out of here.\u2019\u201d He said he witnessed and experienced physical aggression from CECOT guards.",
      "Reyes said he was thankful that he and other men were able to share copies of the Bible inside and motivate each other.",
      "The detainees who spoke to NBC News said they had no contact with the outside world or access to U.S. officials during the four months they were held in CECOT.",
      "Reyes did recall seeing Noem walk by when she toured CECOT in March, shortly after he and the others were sent there. She went past several cells that Salvadoran officials assured her held hardened criminals and gang members.",
      "Reyes says he wasn\u2019t told Noem was coming but remembers that day as the only day the detainees had gotten something cold to drink.",
      "He said he and others pressed their faces to the bars and saw her. \u201cWe began screaming, \u2018Freedom, freedom, freedom. We are not criminals. We are only migrants,\u2019\u201d Reyes said.",
      "The men were sent to CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March, declaring the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua an invading force. Immigration officials have since used that act to deport hundreds of people without immigration hearings, alleging that they were gang members.",
      "The men who spoke to NBC News, as well as the families of former detainees and their attorneys, have strongly denied any ties to gangs and said they were unfairly targeted because of tattoos that may be popular in Venezuela and are unrelated to Tren de Aragua. They have also said some migrants were denied due process and a chance to defend themselves from the accusations against them. Experts have said tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua. An official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement previously said the administration did not solely rely on tattoos to identify the men sent to CECOT as gang members.",
      "A New York Times investigation, which relied on interviews with prosecutors and law enforcement officials as well as court documents and media reports in multiple countries, found that most of the men sent to CECOT did not have criminal records in the United States or in the region. It found at least 32 of the more than 200 men faced serious criminal accusations or convictions in the United States or abroad. Very few of them appeared to have any documented evidence connecting them to Tren de Aragua.",
      "The men said their strong faith in God, love for their families and a belief that one day they would get justice helped them keep going during their most desperate moments.",
      "\u201cReuniting again with my parents and children was a moment of such happiness,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "While the men resume life back in Venezuela, the question of whether they would ever return to the U.S. remains. During a status hearing Thursday tied to the government\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act, the Department of Justice said it would bring any of the men back for immigration or habeas proceedings if a \u201clawful order\u201d were issued.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has made assurances they\u2019ll allow us to do that,\u201d DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis told the court.",
      "Now that they are back home with their families, the men have said they are demanding justice from Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "On Thursday, former detainee Neiyerver Adri\u00e1n Leon Rengel filed a complaint, reviewed by NBC News, against the Department of Homeland Security under the Federal Tort Claims Act, claiming he was removed from the United States unlawfully and without due process. The complaint was filed on behalf Rengel by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Democracy Defenders Fund, which describes itself as a nonpartisan group that defends democratic institutions and opposes autocrats.",
      "LULAC told NBC News that it also planned to file a lawsuit and expected more lawsuits to come after that.",
      "Rengel alleged that he suffered physical, verbal and psychological abuse in CECOT and that the U.S. government could have and should have secured his release, according to the complaint.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the complaint.",
      "\u201cWe were mistreated, our rights were violated, crimes against humanity were committed,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "Hernandez said he and others are still working through the psychological effects of their time in CECOT. \u201cAll 252 [of the men] are doing poorly, mentally.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though we are free, even though we are now with our families, happy and content,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is still a big mental block, a block that particularly I have not been able to find a way to deal with.\u201d",
      "But despite their ongoing struggles, Hernandez said the shared experience has created a lasting sense of community among the men.",
      "\u201cWe entered [CECOT] as 252 strangers, 252 Venezuelans, but 252 brothers came out,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe all supported each other; we were all there in the constant fight.\u201d",

    "summary": "New research builds on evidence that diet, certain brain training exercises and physical activity can delay the decline of memory and other cognitive abilities.",
    "story": [
      "Although her grandfather had dementia when he died, Kristin Richardson hadn\u2019t worried much about her brain until a lab test revealed that she was positive for APOE4, a gene that has been linked to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. That was seven and a half years ago.",
      "Richardson, now 51, remembers crying when she got the news. \u201cI was terrified,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible, horrible disease with no cure.\u201d",
      "So Richardson, a business owner in Richmond, Virginia, decided to make whatever changes she could to reduce her risk of the disease. \u201cI do what I can to get enough sleep. I keep active. I try to eat well and maintain a healthy weight, and I\u2019m always working my brain to learn new things,\u201d she said.",
      "Two new studies being presented at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association meeting Monday in Toronto may give some hope to Richardson and others who carry a genetic risk for the disease. Both new studies build on previous evidence that diet, certain brain training exercises and physical activity can delay the loss of memory and slow the decline of other cognitive abilities.",
      "One study looked at the impact of walking on 2,985 Black and white older adults who were tested for APOE status and were followed for 10 years. Each year, the participants were questioned about the amount of walking they did, and at multiple points during the follow-up period, their cognitive status was evaluated with standardized exams.",
      "Overall, participants with the APOE4 gene mutation showed steeper declines in cognition compared with those with other forms of the gene that don\u2019t raise the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. While walking appeared to have a protective effect on all the participants, it was strongest among those with APOE4.",
      "The risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s among those with two copies of APOE4 is 12 times that of women with none and four times that of men with none, said the study\u2019s senior author, Cindy Barha, an assistant professor of neuroscience at the University of Calgary and Canada Research chair in neuroscience, brain health and exercise.",
      "That changed significantly if people walked. Overall, women benefited more.",
      "A 10% higher amount of self-reported walking was associated with a 4.7% increase in complex thinking performance over time in women and a 2.6% increase in men.",
      "Among APOE4 carriers, men appeared to benefit more. A 10% higher amount of self-reported walking was associated with an 8.5% increase in global cognitive performance over time in women and a 12% increase in men. That was a surprise to the researchers, who expected that women would continue to benefit more.",
      "Walking seems to keep brains healthier by pumping up levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that\u2019s known to support the health of brain cells, Barha said. Other proteins in the brain may be involved, as well.",
      "\u201cBDNF is like fertilizer for your brain that is naturally produced, especially when you are being physically active, such as when you are walking,\u201d Barha said. \u201cIt helps brain cells survive, grow and form stronger connections; this supports memory, learning and mood, especially in the hippocampus, which is the brain\u2019s memory center.\u201d",
      "A limitation of the study is that it didn\u2019t track how fast or how frequently the participants walked.",
      "Dementia risk modified through lifestyle",
      "The second international study, led by researchers in Finland, found that a combination of lifestyle modifications could also benefit people with the APOE4 variation more than those with other mutations.",
      "The study included 2,469 participants from France, Japan and Finland who were randomly assigned to receive multi-focus lifestyle interventions or not. Among the participants were 709 APOE4 carriers.",
      "Included in the lifestyle modifications were:",
      "Cognitive training, either computer-based or with paper and pencil.Physical activity, including group-based physical group exercise sessions lasting 90 minutes and an exercise program supervised by physiotherapists at the gym.Dietary counseling.",

      "A preliminary analysis revealed that the benefit of the intervention was greater among the APOE4 carriers.",
      "Study co-author Jenni Lehtisalo, a research fellow at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, said the main takeaway is that the risk for dementia, even in people with genetic predisposition, can be modified through lifestyle.",
      "There was about a fourfold greater benefit in those who were positive for APOE4, said Lehtisalo, who is also a visiting researcher at the University of Eastern Finland.",
      "The hope is that future research will reveal whether there is a specific window of time during which the modifications are more effective, she said.",
      "Dr. Cynthia Boyd, a professor of medicine and director of the division of geriatric medicine and gerontology at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the studies show \u201cthere is something concrete we can all do to decrease the risk of cognitive decline.\u201d",
      "\u201cWalking and other lifestyle modifications can be protective for the brain,\u201d said Boyd, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new research.",
      "Adam Brickman, a professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said that to optimize brain and cognitive health, it\u2019s a good idea for everyone, regardless of genetic risk, to engage in physical activity, maintain a good diet and monitor other risk factors linked to dementia.",
      "\u201cSometimes initiating new healthy behaviors is difficult for people,\" Brickman said. \"Knowledge of being at increased risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease by virtue of having an APOE4 allele may help inspire or motivate lifestyle changes to mitigate that risk.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "New research builds on evidence that diet, certain brain training exercises and physical activity can delay the decline of memory and other cognitive abilities.",
    "story": [
      "Although her grandfather had dementia when he died, Kristin Richardson hadn\u2019t worried much about her brain until a lab test revealed that she was positive for APOE4, a gene that has been linked to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. That was seven and a half years ago.",
      "Richardson, now 51, remembers crying when she got the news. \u201cI was terrified,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible, horrible disease with no cure.\u201d",
      "So Richardson, a business owner in Richmond, Virginia, decided to make whatever changes she could to reduce her risk of the disease. \u201cI do what I can to get enough sleep. I keep active. I try to eat well and maintain a healthy weight, and I\u2019m always working my brain to learn new things,\u201d she said.",
      "Two new studies being presented at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association meeting Monday in Toronto may give some hope to Richardson and others who carry a genetic risk for the disease. Both new studies build on previous evidence that diet, certain brain training exercises and physical activity can delay the loss of memory and slow the decline of other cognitive abilities.",
      "One study looked at the impact of walking on 2,985 Black and white older adults who were tested for APOE status and were followed for 10 years. Each year, the participants were questioned about the amount of walking they did, and at multiple points during the follow-up period, their cognitive status was evaluated with standardized exams.",
      "Overall, participants with the APOE4 gene mutation showed steeper declines in cognition compared with those with other forms of the gene that don\u2019t raise the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. While walking appeared to have a protective effect on all the participants, it was strongest among those with APOE4.",
      "The risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s among those with two copies of APOE4 is 12 times that of women with none and four times that of men with none, said the study\u2019s senior author, Cindy Barha, an assistant professor of neuroscience at the University of Calgary and Canada Research chair in neuroscience, brain health and exercise.",
      "That changed significantly if people walked. Overall, women benefited more.",
      "A 10% higher amount of self-reported walking was associated with a 4.7% increase in complex thinking performance over time in women and a 2.6% increase in men.",
      "Among APOE4 carriers, men appeared to benefit more. A 10% higher amount of self-reported walking was associated with an 8.5% increase in global cognitive performance over time in women and a 12% increase in men. That was a surprise to the researchers, who expected that women would continue to benefit more.",
      "Walking seems to keep brains healthier by pumping up levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that\u2019s known to support the health of brain cells, Barha said. Other proteins in the brain may be involved, as well.",
      "\u201cBDNF is like fertilizer for your brain that is naturally produced, especially when you are being physically active, such as when you are walking,\u201d Barha said. \u201cIt helps brain cells survive, grow and form stronger connections; this supports memory, learning and mood, especially in the hippocampus, which is the brain\u2019s memory center.\u201d",
      "A limitation of the study is that it didn\u2019t track how fast or how frequently the participants walked.",
      "Dementia risk modified through lifestyle",
      "The second international study, led by researchers in Finland, found that a combination of lifestyle modifications could also benefit people with the APOE4 variation more than those with other mutations.",
      "The study included 2,469 participants from France, Japan and Finland who were randomly assigned to receive multi-focus lifestyle interventions or not. Among the participants were 709 APOE4 carriers.",
      "Included in the lifestyle modifications were:",
      "Cognitive training, either computer-based or with paper and pencil.Physical activity, including group-based physical group exercise sessions lasting 90 minutes and an exercise program supervised by physiotherapists at the gym.Dietary counseling.",
      "Cognitive training, either computer-based or with paper and pencil.",
      "Physical activity, including group-based physical group exercise sessions lasting 90 minutes and an exercise program supervised by physiotherapists at the gym.",
      "Dietary counseling.",
      "A preliminary analysis revealed that the benefit of the intervention was greater among the APOE4 carriers.",
      "Study co-author Jenni Lehtisalo, a research fellow at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, said the main takeaway is that the risk for dementia, even in people with genetic predisposition, can be modified through lifestyle.",
      "There was about a fourfold greater benefit in those who were positive for APOE4, said Lehtisalo, who is also a visiting researcher at the University of Eastern Finland.",
      "The hope is that future research will reveal whether there is a specific window of time during which the modifications are more effective, she said.",
      "Dr. Cynthia Boyd, a professor of medicine and director of the division of geriatric medicine and gerontology at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the studies show \u201cthere is something concrete we can all do to decrease the risk of cognitive decline.\u201d",
      "\u201cWalking and other lifestyle modifications can be protective for the brain,\u201d said Boyd, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new research.",
      "Adam Brickman, a professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said that to optimize brain and cognitive health, it\u2019s a good idea for everyone, regardless of genetic risk, to engage in physical activity, maintain a good diet and monitor other risk factors linked to dementia.",
      "\u201cSometimes initiating new healthy behaviors is difficult for people,\" Brickman said. \"Knowledge of being at increased risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease by virtue of having an APOE4 allele may help inspire or motivate lifestyle changes to mitigate that risk.\u201d"

      "The 59-year-old religious leader also broke his vow of celibacy, having \u201cimproper relationships\u201d with women over a long period of time and fathering at least one child out of wedlock, the temple said in a separate statement Sunday.",

      "The partial easing of restrictions comes amid mounting global outrage over rising deaths and scenes of starvation under Israel's military offensive on the Palestinian enclave it has besieged.",
      "\u201cThis is progress, but vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health crisis,\u201d United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher warned in a statement Sunday after Israel announced a pause in military operations in certain areas for 10 hours daily.",
      "Sunday's aid deliveries were a \"drop in the ocean\" and the days ahead will be \"make or break\" in addressing the hunger crisis, Fletcher told British broadcaster BBC News on Monday.",
      "His warnings were echoed by others as the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave said Monday that 14 new deaths over the past 24 hours were attributed to \u201cfamine and malnutrition,\u201d with two children among those killed.",
      "That brought the total number of deaths due to malnutrition up to 147, including 88 children, since the war began, the health ministry said, with most of those recorded in recent months, according to statements from the United Nations. NBC News was not able to independently confirm the figures.",
      "Humanitarian groups and doctors have warned for weeks of  mounting malnutrition in Gaza, with Israel allowing only a \u201cbasic\u201d amount of food in since May when it lifted its weekslong blockade barring the entry of aid into the enclave.",

      "Ryan expressed some optimism but added that a ceasefire would be the best way to address the spiraling hunger crisis.",

      "Video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed scores of Palestinians running toward a handful of parachutes dotting the sky in northern Gaza, which COGAT said was airdropped in collaboration with the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.",
      "Meanwhile, Palestinians could could also be seen carrying bags of flour slung over their shoulders after more than 120 trucks carrying aid were collected and distributed by the U.N. and other aid organizations, according to COGAT.",
      "Abdul Rahman Al-Kahlout, 18, said he waited for hours under the blazing sun in hope of reaching the supplies before they ran out.",
      "\"We died in the sun for four hours,\" Al-Kahlout said. He described shots being fired and soldiers surrounding Palestinians as they waited for the aid several times. He said he feared he was \"going to die for flour.\"",
      "More than 1,000 people, including children, have been killed by Israeli forces while waiting for and trying to reach aid since a new aid distribution system was implemented in late May, led by the controversial U.S. and Israel-backed group the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Health officials in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed at least 41 Palestinians from late Saturday into Sunday, including 26 people who were seeking aid, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Facing growing pressure from the global community, Israel has sought to justify both its restrictions and the introduction of a new distribution system by arguing that Hamas has been diverting aid from civilians in the enclave throughout the war.",
      "But an internal U.S. government analysis has found no evidence of systematic theft of aid supplies by Hamas over the past 20 months, according to a report presented to State Department officials and later seen by NBC News. The IDF dismissed the report as \"biased.\"",
      "Both the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the World Food Programme have previously told NBC News that they had not seen any evidence of Hamas diverting aid.",

    "story": [
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. \u2014 Linda McMahon and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have largely been skewered by Democrats for the way they have run President Donald Trump\u2019s Education and Health departments.",
      "But over the weekend at a bipartisan summit of governors in Colorado Springs, they received a distinctly warm welcome \u2014 including from the Democrats on hand.",
      "Instead of pressing McMahon on her plans to eliminate the Education Department, a move that will substantially affect state budgets, Democrats who attended the National Governors Association meeting in the mountain foothills of Colorado offered praise to McMahon during a Friday session over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to release billions in education funding it had withheld. And they peppered her with questions about students\u2019 mental health, early childhood education and artificial intelligence \u2014 areas where they might be able to find common ground.",
      "On Saturday, Kennedy, whose stances on vaccines have drawn fierce criticism, held court with a group of Democratic governors, assuring them that he did not want to see budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "These conciliatory moments, which occurred throughout the NGA\u2019s summer meeting, underscored the bind Democrats have found themselves in during Trump\u2019s second term: weighing when to fight back against the administration, as the base is pushing for, and when to work with it to benefit their constituents.",
      "It\u2019s a balancing act that\u2019s particularly acute at the state level. While Democrats are out of power in Washington, the party\u2019s governors have much more authority. And governors in particular have prided themselves on searching for common ground, even in a heated political environment \u2014 a core purpose of the NGA.",
      "Still, a growing number of Democrats argue that calls for bipartisanship do not meet the current moment. Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Laura Kelly of Kansas were among several Democrats who did not attend the summit. All told, seven Democratic governors and 11 Republican governors came for at least part of the weekend, the NGA said, while three governors attended virtually.",
      "Walz and Kelly, as The Atlantic first reported, declined to renew their NGA membership dues for the upcoming fiscal year, due to broader frustrations with how the group has approached the Trump administration.",
      "A source familiar with the governors\u2019 thinking said that Walz\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s feelings were \u201ca view held by more than just these two governors\u201d and were a product of \u201cfrustration\u201d that the NGA \u201chad tied its own hands\u201d by not taking a more active role in advocating for states and governors amid Trump\u2019s attacks.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t agree on standing up for states\u2019 rights, we\u2019re passively endorsing what the president is doing,\u201d the source said.",
      "During his second term, Trump has defied or threatened many Democratic-led states. Trump deployed National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles amid unrest over his immigration policies, despite objections from California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Trump also froze federal funds for a child nutrition program in Maine after he clashed with Gov. Janet Mills over an issue related to transgender athletes. (The Trump administration later halted the freeze.) Newsom and Mills also did not attend the summit.",
      "'We can\u2019t just walk away'",
      "Several Democratic governors who attended the weekend meeting expressed sympathy for Walz\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s decision. They also highlighted the importance of finding common ground with their political adversaries, suggesting that it remained a better option to try to win influence with them instead of not showing up.",
      "\u201cThe promise that I made to the people of Maryland when the Trump administration came on board was that I will work with anyone, but I will bow down to no one,\u201d Maryland\u2019s Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said during a session with reporters at the summit in response to a question from NBC News.",
      "\u201cBut there\u2019s a clear understanding and a clear desire to be able to work with anybody to make sure that the people of my state and the people for all of our states are getting the support that they need. And I think one of the benefits of this weekend was, you know, we got a chance to sit down with Secretary Kennedy, that we got a chance to actually sit down with Secretary McMahon,\u201d added Moore, who was elected vice char of the NGA over the weekend.",
      "He noted that previously he had not had the chance to do so in the first seven months of Trump\u2019s second term. \u201cI actually think it was a real benefit,\u201d Moore said.",
      "Moore is no stranger to fighting with the administration: Most recently, he has accused Trump of denying his state federal disaster assistance for flooding in Maryland in May. Moore said he\u2019d spoken with Walz and Kelly, calling their frustrations \u201cjustified.\u201d But he added that the NGA \u201cis never going to be either the cheerleader nor the heckler of a federal administration.\u201d",
      "Hawaii\u2019s Democratic Gov. Josh Green, a physician who has blamed Kennedy for measles outbreaks, said he had a \u201cvaluable\u201d private meeting with the health secretary that lasted an hour.",
      "\u201cI have some deep ideological differences with Secretary Kennedy,\u201d Green said in an interview with NBC News. But he added that creating a collaborative environment with Kennedy and McMahon helped him explain to them why he felt \u201cthings have to happen to protect vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "Green said that he and Kennedy discussed how governors could most effectively access the $50 billion rural hospital fund that was included in the massive tax cut and spending bill Trump recently signed into law.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just walk away, in my opinion,\u201d Green said. \u201cEven though I\u2019ll keep pushing back on any changes to the vaccine schedule \u2026 I will also be able to take some advantage of the relationships.\u201d",
      "Green also said he had \u201cdeep disagreements\u201d with McMahon, but that he felt it remained important to maintain a dialogue.",
      "\u201cDo I have concerns about working with the secretary of education?\u201d Green said. \u201cOf course I do, but I would have deeper concerns if there was no one that could speak up for what I feel is about half of the country.\u201d",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat whose term as NGA chair ended this weekend, said he invited Kennedy and McMahon in particular because governors had expressed to him that health care and education were two of the top issues they wanted to address during the event.",
      "\u201cI think these times call for the kind of bipartisan work of the NGA more than ever before. The American people want progress,\u201d Polis said. \u201cAnd that only comes when the politicians stop fighting over their party labels and work together to achieve real outcomes that actually matter in people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "Disagreements remain",
      "Democratic governors still made their disagreements with Republicans clear at the summit.",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy was among several Democratic governors to lambast the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d and its cuts to Medicaid and food assistance.",
      "And a cadre of Democratic governors slammed Texas Republicans\u2019 plans to redraw its congressional maps ahead of schedule in an effort to help the GOP protect its narrow House majority in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "In an emailed statement in response to questions from NBC News, NGA spokesperson Eric Wohlschlegel said that \u201cthe record participation and support of NGA isn\u2019t because governors avoid tough topics; it\u2019s because NGA is one of the few places where they can cut through the noise and collectively focus on what works.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical in a political climate where so many issues become zero-sum fights, NGA provides something increasingly rare: a forum for real, results-driven, bipartisan problem-solving. That\u2019s why governors keep showing up,\u201d Wohlschlegel added.",
      "Green, Hawaii\u2019s governor, said that approach paid off \u2014 even though \u201csometimes it gives me heartburn.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt really depends on what your tolerance is to try to navigate these differences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are tough moments for sure.\u201d"

Many of the men and some of their families and attorneys have denied the claim. The men were released and flown to Venezuela on July 18 as part of a prisoner swap with the United States.",
      "Andry Hernandez Romero, a 32-year-old gay asylum-seeker from Venezuela, told NBC News that one day during his imprisonment he was taken to solitary confinement, where prison staff \u201cmade me kneel, perform oral sex on one person, while the others groped me and touched my private parts\u201d and \u201cstroked me with their batons.\u201d",
      "He said he could not identify the guards because their faces were covered and the room did not have a lightbulb, with only a small amount of light coming in through a hole in the ceiling.",
      "Hernandez said the incident left him devastated.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to eat. I didn\u2019t want to do absolutely anything,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThe only thing I did was stay laying down, look at the toilet, remember my family, asking myself a million questions.\u201d",
      "Another detainee who spoke to NBC News, Jerce Reyes, said Hernandez told him after they were released that he was sexually abused by CECOT staff. Hernandez also said on Venezuelan state media that he was sexually abused while in CECOT.",
      "\u201cHe told us that when we arrived in Venezuela, that he suffered abuse at the hands of guards there in El Salvador,\u201d said Reyes, referring to Hernandez\u2019s account of sexual abuse.",
      "Hernandez said he was unaware of any formal system at CECOT through which he could report the alleged abuse and that if detainees tried to complain to superiors at the prison, they would often be subjected to beatings by guards.",
      "The Salvadoran government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hernandez\u2019s sexual assault allegations and claims from other Venezuelan men that they were physically and psychologically abused in the prison. The government has previously said it observes safety and order standards, and the director of CECOT told CNN that \u201cthe whole operation is based on strict respect for human rights.\u201d In a statement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security referred NBC News to the Salvadoran government for comment because the Venezuelan men were \u201cnot U.S. citizens or under U.S. jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "When asked whether the U.S. government would continue to send people to CECOT, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, \u201cwhether it is CECOT, Alligator Alcatraz, Guantanamo Bay or another detention facility, these dangerous criminals will not be allowed to terrorize U.S. citizens.\u201d",
      "The statement said that President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u201care using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens off our streets and out of our country. Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u2018You will not be leaving here\u2019",
      "Hernandez and others said they were repeatedly beaten by prison officials.",
      "\u201cOur daily bread there as Venezuelans were beatings, threats. For whatever circumstance,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIf you answer an official, they hit you. ... If you talk, they hit you.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery time they went to hit a large group outside, they would put us in the required position so we couldn\u2019t see. And to hear the moans, to hear how they were hitting the people was also very heavy.\u201d",
      "Another detainee, Andry Blanco Bonilla, 40, said he and the other Venezuelans faced verbal, psychological and physical abuse from the day they entered CECOT.",
      "\u201cThere were so many moments of anguish and terror,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cI feared for my life.\u201d",
      "Blanco Bonilla said that when they first arrived at CECOT, the men were shackled so tightly at the ankles that walking \u201cwould give us cuts and bruises.\u201d He said the guards denied them food and access to bathrooms or showers as punishment.",
      "Blanco Bonilla, who had gone to the U.S. to seek asylum, said he would never forget the words of a prison official who told the detainees, \u201cWelcome to CECOT. Welcome to hell.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou will not be leaving here. Your days are over,\u201d the official said, according to Blanco Bonilla.",
      "The detainees would suffer beatings as the guards saw fit, he said.",
      "\u201cThey tried to avoid hitting our faces. They kicked us in the back or ribs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they made us get on our knees, they would step on our toes with their boots. They hit us with batons, they hit us on the head.\u201d",
      "After a beating, Blanco Bonilla said he would be brought by guards to a prison doctor, who would say to him, \u201cYou hit yourself. How did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "When he tried to tell the doctor that he was beaten by prison staff, a guard would hit him with a baton in the back, Blanco Bonilla said. The doctor would then ask him again, \u201cHow did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized that if I didn\u2019t tell them what they wanted, they would keep hitting me,\u201d he said, adding that the doctor would then make a false report about the incident.",
      "\u2018We are only migrants\u2019",
      "Reyes, 36, said one of hardest moments for him was when a prison official \u201cencouraged us to commit suicide\u201d and told him \u201cthis is how your whole nightmare ends.\u201d",
      "\u201cI did think about committing suicide at some point. But I thought about my two daughters, I thought about my family,\u201d he said about his two children, ages 3 and 6.",
      "Reyes said there were days when \u201cwe woke up and all said to ourselves, \u2018We aren\u2019t getting out of here.\u2019\u201d He said he witnessed and experienced physical aggression from CECOT guards.",
      "Reyes said he was thankful that he and other men were able to share copies of the Bible inside and motivate each other.",
      "The detainees who spoke to NBC News said they had no contact with the outside world or access to U.S. officials during the four months they were held in CECOT.",
      "Reyes did recall seeing Noem walk by when she toured CECOT in March, shortly after he and the others were sent there. She went past several cells that Salvadoran officials assured her held hardened criminals and gang members.",
      "Reyes says he wasn\u2019t told Noem was coming but remembers that day as the only day the detainees had gotten something cold to drink.",
      "He said he and others pressed their faces to the bars and saw her. \u201cWe began screaming, \u2018Freedom, freedom, freedom. We are not criminals. We are only migrants,\u2019\u201d Reyes said.",
      "The men were sent to CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March, declaring the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua an invading force. Immigration officials have since used that act to deport hundreds of people without immigration hearings, alleging that they were gang members.",
      "The men who spoke to NBC News, as well as the families of former detainees and their attorneys, have strongly denied any ties to gangs and said they were unfairly targeted because of tattoos that may be popular in Venezuela and are unrelated to Tren de Aragua. They have also said some migrants were denied due process and a chance to defend themselves from the accusations against them. Experts have said tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua. An official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement previously said the administration did not solely rely on tattoos to identify the men sent to CECOT as gang members.",
      "A New York Times investigation, which relied on interviews with prosecutors and law enforcement officials as well as court documents and media reports in multiple countries, found that most of the men sent to CECOT did not have criminal records in the United States or in the region. It found at least 32 of the more than 200 men faced serious criminal accusations or convictions in the United States or abroad. Very few of them appeared to have any documented evidence connecting them to Tren de Aragua.",
      "The men said their strong faith in God, love for their families and a belief that one day they would get justice helped them keep going during their most desperate moments.",
      "\u201cReuniting again with my parents and children was a moment of such happiness,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "While the men resume life back in Venezuela, the question of whether they would ever return to the U.S. remains. During a status hearing Thursday tied to the government\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act, the Department of Justice said it would bring any of the men back for immigration or habeas proceedings if a \u201clawful order\u201d were issued.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has made assurances they\u2019ll allow us to do that,\u201d DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis told the court.",
      "Now that they are back home with their families, the men have said they are demanding justice from Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "On Thursday, former detainee Neiyerver Adri\u00e1n Leon Rengel filed a complaint, reviewed by NBC News, against the Department of Homeland Security under the Federal Tort Claims Act, claiming he was removed from the United States unlawfully and without due process. The complaint was filed on behalf Rengel by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Democracy Defenders Fund, which describes itself as a nonpartisan group that defends democratic institutions and opposes autocrats.",
      "LULAC told NBC News that it also planned to file a lawsuit and expected more lawsuits to come after that.",
      "Rengel alleged that he suffered physical, verbal and psychological abuse in CECOT and that the U.S. government could have and should have secured his release, according to the complaint.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the complaint.",
      "\u201cWe were mistreated, our rights were violated, crimes against humanity were committed,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "Hernandez said he and others are still working through the psychological effects of their time in CECOT. \u201cAll 252 [of the men] are doing poorly, mentally.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though we are free, even though we are now with our families, happy and content,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is still a big mental block, a block that particularly I have not been able to find a way to deal with.\u201d",
      "But despite their ongoing struggles, Hernandez said the shared experience has created a lasting sense of community among the men.",
      "\u201cWe entered [CECOT] as 252 strangers, 252 Venezuelans, but 252 brothers came out,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe all supported each other; we were all there in the constant fight.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Jul 2025 09:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Animal shelters across America are overcrowded because more pet owners are struggling with higher costs of living.",
    "story": [
      "New York City\u2019s largest animal shelter hit a sad milestone.",
      "Rocky, an 11-year-old senior dog surrendered by his owner, became the 1,000th animal at the Animal Care Centers of New York City, which announced on July 18 that its three shelters stopped accepting dogs, cats, bunnies and other critters, except in emergencies.",
      "The graying pup stood in a cage in a peaceful side office inside the Brooklyn location \u2014 VIP treatment considering hundreds of other dogs at the shelter were in tight quarters that were never intended to be overflowing.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the business to care for animals that come to us, and we want to help people with their pets, but when we have 1,000 animals to care for and a capacity to house them that doesn\u2019t meet that need, we\u2019re in a bit of a difficult situation,\u201d ACC President and CEO Risa Weinstock told NBC News.",
      "Even with the shelter practically bursting at the seams, the staff made exceptions. Weinstock said after they made the announcement to suspend intakes, 200 animals were accepted into their shelters that were either a public safety risk or sent by city agencies. The situation is so dire that New York City stepped in Friday with $1 million to help ACC.",
      "\u201cBut we are asking the public to work with us to slow down what is coming in,\u201d Weinstock said.",
      "As the cost of living and pet care rises, animal shelters across the country are at critical capacity dealing with an influx of surrendered pets, oftentimes due to the price tag associated with their care. An estimated 5.8 million animals filled up facilities last year, according to the nonprofit Shelter Animals Count\u2019s national database.",
      "While there was a 1% decrease in shelter intakes from 2023 to 2024, the levels remain high. In 2019, 55% of shelter dogs had \u201clive outcomes,\u201d meaning they were adopted or returned to their owner. That number dropped to 50% in 2024, with an estimated 334,000 canines being euthanized.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough several years for animal shelters,\u201d said Tori Fugate, the group\u2019s communications director.",
      "In Arizona, animal shelter operators are finding pets abandoned in parking lots or on the side of the road. In Virginia, an over-capacity shelter has taken to social media to call for adoptions urgently. And in Tennessee, one shelter said it is \u201cdrowning\u201d in rescue dogs, forced to stack kennels on top of each other to provide space.",
      "The rise in the cost of living and a shortage of affordable housing are forcing many pet owners in America into tough circumstances, according to Fugate.",
      "The price of pet care has risen dramatically. A Bank of America Institute report found that since 2019, prices of services like veterinary care and grooming have gone up 42%, with the cost of goods like food and treats surging 22%. Pet insurance is expensive, too.",
      "That has led pet owners to pull back on pet-related transactions: Card spending at pet stores dropped by 4% from April 2024 to this April, while spending at vets dropped 1% during the same period.",
      "\u201cThe main reason for pet surrender is, \u2018I can\u2019t afford it.\u2019 Vet care is expensive, food is expensive, I mean, just human cost of living is expensive,\u201d Weinstock said.",
      "Shelters are working to provide new resources to persuade pet owners to reconsider or delay surrendering their pets. The ACC in New York provides free food, vaccine clinics and veterinarian vouchers \u2014 \u201canything we can do to help you keep your pet,\u201d Weinstock said.",
      "\u201cEven if it\u2019s just one animal, one person\u2019s dog, who we said, \u2018If we give you food for a month and you can pay your electricity, would that help you take your dog or your cat or your rabbit home?\u2019 and they say yes, and they walk off with their kids and they\u2019re crying because we were able to keep that pet with them, that\u2019s a good day,\u201d she added.",
      "Shelter Animals Count also found that the timeline for animals in these facilities is changing.",
      "\u201cThe length of stay, so the time that animals are spending in the shelter, is increasing year over year,\u201d Fugate told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe can have a dog stay here, a cat, a guinea pig, a rabbit, could be three days, and it could be over a year,\u201d Weinstock said.",
      "Weinstock said euthanasia remains the \u201clast, last, last choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur goal is if there\u2019s nothing wrong with them behaviorally or medically, and they\u2019re not a safety risk, they\u2019re going to stay here, and we\u2019re going to market them every chance we get,\u201d she said.",
      "The solution to reduce the overpopulation of returned animals isn\u2019t an easy one. Weinstock said it requires the community to step up and foster pets \u2014 but also government resources to address the root causes of pets being surrendered.",
      "On Friday, New York Mayor Eric Adams announced the city would be investing $1 million into the ACC.",
      "\u201cIn so many ways, our pets care for us and our loved ones, and it\u2019s important that we care for them, too,\u201d Adams said in a news release.",
      "The mayor, who is up for re-election this year, encouraged New Yorkers to adopt from the ACC and said the funding is intended to hire 14 more staff members for their locations and help with their day-to-day needs.",
      "For those who want to help, \u201cpeople could foster, people could donate, they could volunteer, they can network, they can amplify our message,\u201d Weinstock said. But she added that her team is meant to be a resource to the community during hard times, not a solution to the larger issues at hand.",
      "\u201cPeople who bring their animals are out of options,\u201d Weinstock said. \u201cThey\u2019re not out of compassion.\u201d"

      "Eleven people, ages 29 to 84, were injured in a stabbing attack at the Traverse City store Saturday, and a suspect was arrested.",
      "Bradford James Gille, 42, was quickly subdued by other shoppers and taken into custody when a deputy arrived, the Grand Traverse County sheriff said.",
      "The man barreled past someone else nearby and \"angled toward me,\" Martell, 32, told NBC News. \"And that's when I booked it down the aisle.\"",
      "She said the man looked \"crazed\" and laser-focused on getting to the exit. She said that she doesn't think she was a target or that she even particularly caught the man's attention but that she was uninjured because she got out of the way in time.",

      "\"I'm still sitting and grappling with the weight of realizing that it was kind of a life-or-death moment,\" Martell said. She said it's \"surreal\" that she was there when it happened, especially in retrospect, after seeing all of the news coverage.",
      "\"I could have easily been next,\" she said.",
      "On her way out of the store, she passed at least two men who had stab wounds. One, she said, was elderly and was complaining about his heart. The other made a joke about needing a Band-Aid.",

      "As a mom of two \u2014 ages 3.5 and 9 months \u2014 with a surprise third baby on the way, I\u2019ve hit full-on panic mode about managing outings with three kids in tow. I\u2019m not just talking about family vacations. I mean errands, park trips or dragging everyone to the pediatrician without losing my mind (or a shoe).",
      "So I took matters into my own hands. I tested over 10 compact strollers that promise to make life easier for parents like me. I folded, unfolded, packed trunks, walked the dog, jogged city blocks and yes, juggled a baby while collapsing a stroller one-handed. Here are the ones that actually delivered.",
      "How I Tested Each Stroller",
      "Each stroller went through the same real-life criteria:",
      "Ease of fold: Could I break it down quickly, ideally one-handed?Compactness: Would it fit in my car trunk or coat closet?Wheel performance: How did it handle sidewalks, grass or store aisles?Weight and maneuverability: Could I lift it while holding a baby or steer it with one hand?Newborn-to-toddler usability: Would it work from day one through the toddler years?",

      "The best compact strollers of 2025",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2",
      "The Bugaboo Butterfly 2 became my go-to for city errands and weekend outings. It folds with one hand (a lifesaver when you\u2019re holding a baby and wrangling toddler gear), fits easily into my trunk and has a basket big enough for my oversized diaper bag and snacks. The extended hood provides actual shade, not just a strip of fabric, and the peekaboo window lets me check in on the baby without disrupting nap time. It\u2019s smooth, thoughtfully designed and easy to love \u2014 but it is definitely on the pricier side.",
      "Colugo Compact Stroller",
      "This modern stroller understands the assignment. The one-handed, two-second fold fits in airplane bins, which is a dream when juggling travel gear. My 9-month-old naps easily thanks to the multi-position recline and canopy, while the adjustable calf rest works well for my toddler. The ride is smooth, and the deep storage basket carries everything I need. However, the brake is a little too easy to trigger accidentally with longer legs, and it\u2019s not newborn-ready unless you purchase the bassinet separately.",
      "Doona Infant Car Seat & Stroller",
      "A favorite among new parents for a reason, the Doona transitions from car seat to stroller in seconds. It\u2019s a travel game-changer, especially when your baby falls asleep in the car and you don\u2019t want to wake them. It\u2019s also a space-saver for tight elevators and restaurants. That said, it\u2019s heavy and has a short shelf life \u2014 once your baby outgrows the infant stage, it\u2019s done.",
      "DFY R1 Stroller",
      "This one earned my husband\u2019s rare stamp of approval. With a height-adjustable handle, both of us can push comfortably. The seat reclines fully and grows with your child without the need for inserts. The magnetic buckle feels secure and prevents accidental pinches. While the design is sleek and the ride is sturdy, folding it takes some practice and it\u2019s too bulky for air travel.",
      "Silver Cross Jet\u202f5 Stroller",
      "If you\u2019re a frequent flyer, this one\u2019s for you. The Jet 5 folds into a suitcase shape and stands on its own, perfect for gate-checking or tucking into overhead bins. My baby naps well in the lie-flat seat and the generous canopy helps with sleep on the go. It\u2019s sleek, light and feels luxe, though the storage is minimal and add-on accessories like snack trays and rain covers cost extra.",
      "Beberoad Love R1 Stroller",
      "This under-the-radar pick was a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s incredibly light but still stable over gravel and sidewalks. I was impressed by how secure my 9-month-old felt in the seat. It opens and closes easily, which makes errands faster. The brand is lesser-known and details can be sparse, and while it\u2019s great for babies, it won\u2019t work for my toddler due to weight limits.",
      "UPPAbaby Minu V3 Stroller",
      "This one feels like the luxury sedan of compact strollers. It glides smoothly, folds easily and includes thoughtful features like a peekaboo canopy and adjustable calf rest. My toddler and baby are both comfortable in it, and the high-end finishes make it feel worth the splurge. Still, it\u2019s heavier than other models and lifting it while holding a baby takes effort.",
      "Nuna TRVL dubl Stroller",
      "Perfect for families with two stroller-aged kids. The narrow frame fits through standard doors and the fold is quick and easy. Both seats recline independently, and the canopies provide solid coverage. The biggest drawback? There\u2019s no way to add a third seat or board once baby number three arrives.",
      "Babyzen YOYO2 Stroller",
      "My most traveled stroller. It\u2019s been to Europe, Florida and back. It folds in a flash, fits in plane bins and handles tight city spaces with ease. I love that it transitions from newborn bassinet to toddler seat and can connect with another YOYO for a double setup. But between the limited storage, smaller canopy and the steep price (especially with accessories), it\u2019s definitely an investment.",
      "Valco Trend Duo Side by Side Double Stroller",
      "If you want a double stroller without pushing a tank, this is it. Each seat has plenty of space and coverage, and the ride is smoother than expected even over uneven ground. I can fit two diaper bags in the under-basket. The downside? The fold requires both hands, and it\u2019s too bulky for plane travel or tight entryways.",
      "Cybex Libelle 2 Stroller",
      "This is your \u201ckeep it in the trunk\u201d stroller. It folds down to almost nothing and is perfect for errands or quick trips. It can handle a baby and even a toddler for short rides, and it\u2019s car seat-compatible. Just don\u2019t expect it to conquer cobblestones or hold up to long walks.",
      "Zoe The Traveler",
      "This 13-lb stroller is surprisingly durable. It folds with one hand, the canopy provides solid shade and the magnetic harness makes buckling quick and painless. The leatherette accents give it a high-end feel without the high-end price. For all-day outings, though, I\u2019d recommend adding a seat liner for extra comfort and prepping for a slightly more involved cleanup routine.",
      "Guava Roam Stroller",
      "Think SUV in stroller form. The Guava Roam has a three-wheel design with extra large tires (14-inch rear, 12-inch front) that handle bumps, uneven sidewalks and grass effortlessly \u2014 it\u2019s ideal for joggers or anyone constantly on the move. The padded seat is comfortable for my baby even on long days out, and the deep storage means I don\u2019t need to carry an extra bag.",
      "NBC Select tech reporter Harry Rabinowitz also tested this stroller, and he found it perfectly met his need for a running stroller than folded compactly enough to fit through small doors and vestibules. \u201cWhile I haven\u2019t tested as many strollers as Becca, the Roam was the only stroller that checked all my boxes: safe for running and everyday use, a compact fold, a one-handed carry handle and ample underseat storage,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I can\u2019t imagine my routine without it.\u201d",

Shoe stores usually have specialty tools and an informed staff that can help you identify and consider things like your foot shape, arch type and gait. Some stores can even perform a treadmill analysis of your walk.",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Experts recommend replacing most types of sneakers every 300 to 500 miles, including walking shoes. Make a note of when you buy a new pair, and put a reminder for yourself every six months or so to consider your mileage.",
      "There are three types of arches: flat, neutral and high, says Dr. Olga Shvets, a podiatrist at Central Park Podiatry. You can learn more in our full story about how to identify your arch type.",
      "Shvets finds that people with flat feet do well in neutral (or pronator) shoes. She also recommends an insert to help the shoe fit in a more neutral manner. Anyone with a high arch may benefit from a high lacing shoe to keep the ankle stable, as well as inserts like orthotics.",
      "The best way to get a precise determination of your foot type is to consult a podiatrist, especially if you are experiencing foot pains and discomfort, says Cunha.",
      "Meet our experts",

      "Richardson recalls the couple driving around Kansas City, throwing out baby names. \"I just was like, 'What about Kelce?'\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "The couple's baby, born in Kansas City on July 24 just before 11 a.m. CT, has already become a viral star. Just one day after she entered the world, Liberty Hospital posted a photo of the newborn when Richardson's nurses fell in love with her baby's name. The hospital is part of the University of Kansas Health System, which is the official health care provider for the Chiefs.",
      "\"We are so excited to announce the birth of the youngest Swiftie and newest member of The Kansas City Chiefs Red Kingdom!!\" reads the post, which has more than 17,000 likes and been covered by People, USA Today and more.",
      "\"Kelce Taylor is officially in her newborn era.\"",
      "Baby Dillon's full name is Kelce Taylor-Grace Dillon, the parents tell TODAY.com in an interview following their discharge from the hospital.",
      "Her first name, Kelce, is a reference to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who's about to start his 13th season with the 2024 Super Bowl champs. Meanwhile, Taylor is a nod to 14-time Grammy winner Taylor Swift, who has become a Kansas City celebrity in her own right after she and Travis Kelce took their relationship public at Arrowhead Stadium in September 2023.",
      "Dillon, fittingly wearing a No. 87 jersey during the interview, says he's been a Kansas City Chiefs fan for 34 years. (To note, Dillon is 34.)",
      "\"If I was anything else, my dad probably would have disowned me,\" Dillon says.",
      "Growing up, Dillon was a major fan of longtime Chief Tony Gonzalez. He played tight end in middle school and in the local Pop Warner youth football program. Though Dillon eventually \u201cfell out of the love of playing the game,\" he says he never fell out of love with the game itself.",
      "He recalls witnessing Travis Kelce being drafted to the Chiefs in 2013 and how since then, he's become \"as good as we thought he was going to be.\" But Dillon admires Kelce for how he lives his life off the field, citing his organization Eighty-Seven & Running, which aims to provide resources to disadvantaged youth in Kansas City and his hometown of Cleveland Heights, Ohio.",
      "In other words, for Dillon and Richardson, Kelce is a name to be proud of.",
      "\"We felt like the name was appropriate because we would like her to grow up to have his spirit of helping others and making sure his community is better off when he leaves than when he got there,\" Dillon says.",
      "\"Give her some really great people to kind of emulate as she gets older, if she wants to,\" Richardson adds.",
      "The couple say they've never met another Kelce. But in the wake of the Facebook post's virality, Dillon says they've seen comments about similar baby name stories, such as a parent in Philadelphia who said they named their child Kelce Lane, after former Eagles center Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson.",
      "Richardson says they considered spelling their daughter's name the more traditional way, Kelsey. Dillon has two more children who also have five letter names that start with K, so following the spelling of Travis Kelce's last name \"fits a pattern,\" he says.",
      "As for comments from those who wonder if they know the \"real\" pronunciation of Travis Kelce's last name \u2014 which the NFL star's dad, Ed Kelce, clarified in 2023 was \"Kels\" \u2014 the couple are well aware.",
      "In fact, Kels is one of many possible nicknames they already have in mind \u2014 part of the reason they picked the name in the first place.",
      "\"We wanted to give her that opportunity as she gets older and kind of matures and decides whether or not she wants to go by Kelce or Kels, or even if she's more like tomboy-ish, she can go by KT,\" Richardson says. \"We wanted to give her lots of options with her name as she grows up and becomes her own person.\"",
      "Their daughter's middle name, Taylor-Grace, in true Swift fashion, contains another Easter egg, Dillon says.",
      "\"TG in the middle \u2014\u00a0Tony Gonzalez was my first favorite football player, so we kind of snuck that in there as well,\" he says.",
      "As for why they picked Taylor, Richardson says after learning more about the singer since her relationship with Travis Kelce began, she's become a fan.",
      "\"I really grew to love her as a human being, more than just the superstar that she is,\" Richardson says.",
      "She cites Swift's well-publicized philanthropy, including her donations to local charities during the \"Eras Tour\" and the $100,000 bonus checks she gave her truck drivers.",
      "\"I really wanted Kelce to have that ... be able to (say), 'Oh this is who I'm named after. Maybe that's a good person that I should look up to,'\" Richardson says.",
      "When it comes to the attention their baby's name has invited, Dillon says \"98% of the comments are positive.\" There's been some hate and even a little confusion that the baby was actually born to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. (\"I am flattered that people think my baby is Taylor Swift's baby,\" Richardson says with a laugh.)",
      "Some commenters have also asked the question: What if Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce break up?",
      "\"They're still two people at the top of their respective fields,\" Richardson says. \"So honestly, we didn't even think about it. It doesn't matter to us whether or not they break up. We just wanted to give her people to look up to.\""

At one point during a match, Happy suggests that Oscar go to his \u201chappy place,\u201d which includes Kelce\u2019s character tied to a light post.

      "\u201cYour dad was smooth as hell,\u201d Sandler said. \u201cI was telling you guys he\u2019s in loads of shots. I think it\u2019s when you cut to either me or Lee Trevino, you see Ed and he\u2019s always right in the shot looking cool as hell, looking like a proud member of the gold jacket club. I don\u2019t know what year your father in the movie won the gold jacket, but he wore it proudly and he was cool as hell.\u201d",

      "Episode 3 of the Gen Z take on the \u201ceclectic group of New York City roommates trope\u201d sees the 20-something crew deal with a stabber in their Queens neighborhood. And the wanted sign posted on their block features the suspect smiling and waving to none other than one of their own.",
      "Anton and the alleged stabber had exchanged phone numbers and made weekly dinner plans. After, his roommates force him to go through his texts, where they find hundreds of chummy brief exchanges with contacts like, \u201cBriana Acupuncture Student\u201d or \u201cLeather jacket Newsies chorus.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe phone episode is very me,\u201d Thiele tells TODAY.com. \u201cTo the point where I was like, we might as well just use my real phone.\u201d",
      "Thiele has previously called himself a \u201cnepo friend,\u201d due to his past experience landing roles in projects created by his friends. For example: Thiele went to high school with \u201cTheater Camp\u201d writer and star Molly Gordon before playing head of costumes Gigi Charbonier in 2023. Before 2025\u2019s \u201cOvercompensating,\u201d series\u2019 creator Benito Skinner \u2014 who wrote the show in part based on his own early 2010s college experience \u2014 was \u201calready my best friend,\u201d Thiele says.",
      "But with \u201cAdults,\u201d an eight-episode comedy series helmed by executive producer Nick Kroll, Thiele landed a starring role, building a character he could \u201cinfuse\u201d himself into and becoming one-half of one of entertainment\u2019s most beloved phenomena: the sitcom ship.",
      "\u201cNick Kroll did a fake out where he told us that we were getting on a Zoom to do another round of auditions, but really it was to tell us that we got the role \u2014 it was that moment where I was like, \u2018I actually booked something, not through a friend who I forced to put me in something,\u2019\u201d Thiele says.",
      "\u201cThat was the moment that I really felt like, \u2018I can do this,\u2019\u201d he adds.",
      "Below, Thiele, 28, discusses his breakout summer, that surprising kiss between Anton and Paul Baker (or \u201cPanton,\u201d as fans have dubbed them) and previews what viewers can expect from his own show, \u201cOff Color,\u201d a semi-autobiographical comedy about family.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "'Overcompensating' premiered in May. Weeks later, 'Adults' dropped. How would you describe the past few months?",
      "It is surreal. It is the most insane \u2014 it\u2019s a dream of all dreams. Every time I feel like I\u2019m looking for synonyms in my head for the word whirlwind. It\u2019s just been a whirlwind of joy. It was so amazing to make both shows. I feel like both of the shows that I\u2019m in I got very lucky with the cast and the crew. \u201cAdults\u201d I didn\u2019t know anyone when I started, but they\u2019ve become my best friends, and \u201cOvercompensating,\u201d I knew Benny really well, and he was already my best friend. So it\u2019s just working with friends, which I think you always hear about, but it rarely happens.",
      "'Overcompensating' has been celebrated for embracing millennial culture, whereas 'Adults' has been billed as for Gen Z. Which generation do you identify with?",
      "Well, I\u2019m a cusper. I\u2019m an honest, true cusper. I remember watching \u201cGirls\u201d and being like, \u201cThis is me.\u201d And then now I\u2019m watching TikToks of these 19 year olds, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, my God, that\u2019s totally me.\u201d So I feel like I can kind of straddle both worlds.",
      "How would you sum up the difference between the generations' styles of humor?",
      "I think \u201cOvercompensating\u201d is in the world of \u201cWet Hot American Summer,\u201d these movies that we loved growing up, which just feel fun and camp. It\u2019s so relatable. I dropped out of college after two weeks ... but even still, I was like, \u201cI know a Hailee. I know a Grace.\u201d I knew every character. I feel like the humor is really based in relatability.",
      "And with \u201cAdults,\u201d what I think they do so brilliantly is they take from the Gen Z sensibility of ... it\u2019s just joke after joke. I feel like now with TikTok, we\u2019re so used to this fast paced, joke-after-joke lifestyle. I remember watching a TikTok the other day and it was a minute long. The joke didn\u2019t come until the end and I was like, \u201cThis is so boring.\u201d I\u2019m so used to, like, 10 seconds in there\u2019ll be a joke, 20 seconds in, another.",
      "On your TikTok, you've engaged a lot with fans of the show. What was your approach to putting Anton into your social media?",
      "For me, I think what was fun about the social media aspect is, a lot of who I am as a person is also in Anton. So it was really fun to even just post something that Owen would post and people would be like, \u201cThis is so Anton.\u201d I was like, is that a compliment? Are you roasting me, or are you being super nice?",
      "People have really taken to the Anton and Paul Baker plot line, which I think is so beautiful. It\u2019s so cheesy to say this but it really makes me feel like, \u201cOh, people love, love. Love wins.\u201d",
      "Also, it\u2019s so fun to tease because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the next season. On my own TikTok, I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, what if this happened?\u201d Then I see the reaction and I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, that can\u2019t happen because everyone hated that TikTok.\u201d I feel like the creators, too, are learning from the way that we have our own special communication with the people watching it. And it feels like we\u2019re just all in a friend group. They\u2019re like, \u201cWait, Issa (Amita Rao) needs a girlfriend in Season 2!\u201d And (creators) Ben (Kronengold) and Rebecca (Shaw) are so brilliant, I feel like they will hear that and take the people watching opinions, because it matters.",
      "Does your phone look like Anton's?",
      "So this is what happened. I'm just gonna tell you it straight. (Laughs). So Episode 1, the pilot, when I auditioned, Anton was struggling with dating as he is in the season, but he was a little more emotionally reserved and a little more cutting. Then as we built this character together, they kind of infused a little bit of my people-pleasing aspects into Anton. So then it became a mix of what they had brilliantly written before, and also a little bit of Owen as well \u2014 I just used my name in the third person ... I cannot believe I just did it.",
      "But yeah, they infuse Anton with me. For instance, the phone episode is very me to the point where I was like, we might as well just use my real phone. We didn\u2019t, thank God. But yes, if you look at my phone, it\u2019s like, \u201cCar Accident No. 4,\u201d like, \u201cGray Socks Guy From Bar.\u201d",
      "Right now I have probably 2,000 unread text messages. But I would like to say that my mother is worse than me and meets people on the street and puts me in group chats with random people. So that's why I have so many unread texts, because my mom will go to a 7-Eleven, meet someone and put me in a group chat with this person and all of his family.",
      "\"Adults\" opens with Issa's boyfriend, the Canadian, sexually fluid Paul Baker (Jack Innanen), moving into the house. He and Anton strike up a close friendship. In the season's finale, Paul Baker learns his visa's expiring, so Issa proposes. After she gets cold feet, their other housemates Samir (Malik Elassal) and Billie (Lucy Freyer) also offer to marry him.",
      "The final scene reveals that Paul Baker and Anton got married. At their roommates' urging, they share a kiss that turns more than platonic. But before anyone can react, the power goes out.",
      "I want to talk about the ending. At the civil wedding ceremony, did Anton volunteer to marry Paul Baker, or did Paul Baker ask Anton to marry him at that moment?",
      "I don't know why, I just got a full chill down my spine. I felt like Anton in this moment.",
      "I probably think, based on who Anton is \u2014 a little more emotionally reserved, emotionally stunted and scared of love \u2014\u00a0I don't think he volunteered. But I think he was so beyond happy when he was asked. That's what I would say.",
      "What has your experience been diving into this fandom?",
      "We'll do anything to make people watch the show. We love it so much that we're like, we will literally read fan fiction if you just turn on the TV. It's been amazing because it feels like everyone watching it and everyone interacting with us online are loving these characters and the stories as much as we did when we were making it. It feels like we\u2019re a little community of people... a group of people that I would get along with.",
      "I love reading all of people\u2019s theories about Paul Baker and Anton, or Samir and Billie, or what Issa is going to do. I\u2019ve never been on a television show that has that. I feel so lucky to be a part of it because I\u2019ve been on the other end for so many shows like that, where I was secretly on my finsta (\u201cfake Instagram,\u201d or a secondary social media account), writing comments about what would happen in the next season of whatever show I\u2019m talking about.",
      "So you were a fan of ship culture?",
      "I love ship culture. (Laughs). I love it. \u201cNew Girl\u201d was a big one for me. Nick and Jess, I was shipping. There\u2019s been so many. I remember re-watching \u201cFriends\u201d during COVID. And I was like, \u201cOh my God. I love Rachel and Ross.\u201d I love a sitcom ship, I really do.",
      "After that kiss, after they deal with the power going out, what happens next?",
      "Here's my theory, and I've never really said this, and maybe I'll get absolutely killed for saying it, but I think they're all going to make it through.",
      "I think Issa and Anton have such a beautiful friendship, and Amita and I actually have mimicked that in real life. We actually are the best of friends. She's gonna be a bridesmaid in my wedding, like, that's the kind of friend she's become to me. So I do feel like, if that happened in real life with Amita and I, we would make it through. I probably wouldn't do it, but we would make it through. So I think everything's gonna be OK, but I do think, of course, there will be some hiccups.",
      "We know Paul Baker has expressed that he thinks Anton's 'the coolest person in the world.' How does Anton view Paul Baker?",
      "I think Anton has finally found someone who he connects to on a level that he's been searching for. But it is just so scary that that person is your best friend's boyfriend.",
      "So I think either this will change him for the better. Maybe he will be more vocal about his feelings, or this will set him back 20 more years. He will never say anything again. Let's hope for the first.",
      "While releasing \u201cOvercompensating\u201d and \u201cAdults,\u201d Thiele has also been working on his own show, \u201cOff Color,\u201d about his relationship with his parents, who adopted him. The show includes executive producer Ilana Glazer.",
      "Per The Hollywood Reporter, the logline reads, \u201cHe\u2019s gay and Black, they\u2019re all Jewish, his mom should be on \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 and his cousin\u2019s a former party girl turned Rabbi-in-training. The comedy is about a son who doesn\u2019t want to grow up, a mother who has no intention of letting him, and a dad who\u2019s probably faking a nap in the other room so he doesn\u2019t have to engage.\u201d",
      "How is the development of 'Off Color' going?",
      "We are chugging along. Our little team, all these people that I\u2019ve looked up to for so long; Kent Alterman and Sarah Babineau were the heads of Comedy Central who greenlit my favorite shows ever, \u201cBroad City\u201d included. And then Ilana, who is a comedy legend and one of my deepest and biggest role models. So it kind of feels crazy to just even work with them.",
      "So we're chugging along, and hopefully something will happen soon.",
      "Thinking of the premise of 'Off Color,' how do you approach putting yourself into a role? Is it natural for you?",
      "Yeah, it is natural \u2014 because I\u2019m such a narcissist. No, no, but it is natural. What\u2019s so funny about writing about my family is that my family is so beautifully insane. I\u2019ll write something and Ilana will read it and be like, \u201cOh, this could not happen.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, no, it just happened two minutes ago, which is why I\u2019m texting you. ... My mother really did this in the grocery store.\u201d",
      "That's why it's so fun, because it feels like family therapy. It feels like I'm journaling about the craziest things that my parents could do. But somehow it's all real."

      "Set in the \u201880s, the eight-episode series centers around four women \u2014 Daniela (Belinda), Dulce (Diana Bovio), Yuri (Regina Bland\u00f3n) and Lupita (Mariana Trevi\u00f1o) \u2014 who are all connected to the recently murdered Emmanuel Mijares (M\u00e9ndez).

The musical's \u2014 and now the show\u2019s \u2014 success stems from the incorporation of hit Spanish pop music of the \u201880s, the likes of Amanda Miguel\u2019s \u201c\u00c9l Me Minti\u00f3\u201d and Daniela Romo\u2019s \u201cMentiras.\u201d After the series was released June 13, the soundtrack debuted on Spotify\u2019s Top 10 albums worldwide list, and at a July 10 screening, M\u00e9ndez and Belinda were surprised with plaques celebrating 100 million streams.",
      "Adding an extra element of nostalgia for viewers, the characters\u2019 names are inspired by iconic Mexican singers Dulce, Emmanuel, Mijares, Daniela Romo, Yuri and Lupita D\u2019Alessio.",

      "Since the show ended in 2019, fans have been longing for a reunion \u2014 and this was it.",
      "Chatting with TODAY.com, M\u00e9ndez and Belinda spoke about the incredible production, the challenges of securing the rights to the popular songs, re-creating those hits while staying true to the original material and more.",
      "This interview has been edited for clarity and translated from Spanish to English.",
      "Luis, did you hand pick the cast for this show?",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: Oh, yeah. What was most important was the adaptation, which was very complicated and took about four years. To create the scripts, we first needed the rights to the songs \u2014 and they were the most popular Spanish songs of the \u201880s, which was tough.",
      "But when it came to the casting, I knew I couldn\u2019t do it without Mariana Trevi\u00f1o, who played Lupita in the original musical. She wasn\u2019t sure about returning to the role and opening Pandora\u2019s box again (but she did). And the other person we always wanted was Belinda.",
      "I found out we were working together on \u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9n Lo Mat\u00f3?\u201d and I feel like we instantly connected. There\u2019s people you meet and you just know who they are, what they\u2019ve been through, what their goals are, what they like, what they don\u2019t \u2014 and that\u2019s what I felt (with Belinda).",
      "Belinda, you've been acting since you were a child but have been focusing on your music career. How do you choose which acting projects to take on?",
      "Belinda: The truth is, I have been sent a lot of scripts and been invited to be part of a lot of movies and shows. But I am very picky. I\u2019m very specific in what I decide to take on.",
      "But I loved \u201cMentiras\u201d because it was a great challenge for me, not only as an actor, because this character has a wide range, but because it\u2019s just me in a room with three incredible actresses and Luis Gerardo.",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: She was holding her own alongside Mariana Trevi\u00f1o, Regina Bland\u00f3n and Diana Bovio, who are masters of comedy. I think the great surprise was that Beli is not only an extraordinary singer and actor, which we knew, but she\u2019s very funny and she can do comedy very well.",
      "One thing that has done very well is the soundtrack. People have been obsessed with it.",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: Not even in my wildest dreams did I imagine it would turn out so good, but it did. It\u2019s been crazy. The songs have millions of streams on Spotify.",
      "We had a feeling that it was going to work out but the response has been very overwhelming and kind, and we are very grateful because no one imagined it.",
      "Was there ever any pressure to re-create these iconic songs?",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: I never thought about that. I never thought about being nervous or needing to be at the same level as (singers) Mijares or Emmanuel, because I knew I was never going to be them.",
      "These characters are singing about something very specific that they are going through at that moment. The great thing about \"Mentiras\" is the characters don't sing just to sing. The characters sing so that the story advances. When the character can't express what they are feeling with words, they start to sing. So it\u2019s not me singing like Mijares, it\u2019s me singing as my character Emmanuel. It\u2019s not Belinda singing like Amanda Miguel, it\u2019s Belinda singing as Daniela. And Belinda did brilliant things with her songs, like \u201cDe Color De Rosa.\u201d",
      "Was it always the plan to make the show look like a play and not like a television show?",
      "Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez: We always want to pay homage to theater and wanted it to feel very theatrical. The references we had when creating the show were \u201cMoulin Rouge,\u201d \u201cLa La Land\u201d and even \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "But we also didn't want it to be like we just filmed the original musical. We wanted to have that essence, though. Antonio Mu\u00f1o-Hierro, the production designer, had this brilliant idea. He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the series called? It\u2019s called \u2018Mentiras\u2019 (\u2018Lies\u2019)\u2019. So let\u2019s show viewers that everything is a lie. That the sets are also fake.\u2019\u201d",
      "And that\u2019s why there\u2019s these moments when (surprise guest) Daniela Romo says, \u201cEverything is a lie,\u201d and pushes the house down and you see that you\u2019re in the Mijares household, but behind that is Daniela\u2019s house. For me, that was beautiful. I grew up in the world of musical theater, and it\u2019s a love letter to theater, and that\u2019s what makes it so visually stunning.",
      "Belinda: It's incredibly well made. It had a large budget for the sets, everything in general was well-designed, the aesthetic, cinematography, every detail was outstanding.",
      "I think it will set a precedent, and people will be like, \u201cLet\u2019s make a series like \u2018Mentiras.\u2019\u201d It will be the example for many other people, and that\u2019s what\u2019s incredible."

      "Rottenberg, who also directed the episode, said she and Zuritsky \u2014 who have been friends since childhood  \u2014\u00a0had \"been writing these characters for so long that we know all of their Achilles\u2019 heels.\"",
      "The duo worked hard to \"rebuild\" Carrie and Aidan's relationship \"in a way that felt new,\" Rottenberg told Variety.",
      "\"They had both really matured and were evolved enough to address their inherent flaws and know their pitfalls,\" she said.",
      "\"We wanted to give them the best shot to make it work. And the reality was, given who they both are and the situation they\u2019re in, we built an untenable situation,\" she continued, adding, \"But we wanted them both to have a strong argument \u2014 to be able to walk away and say, I gave it everything I could, and it didn\u2019t work.\"",
      "The writing duo also knew it was important to show how much Carrie had evolved since she and Aidan dated the first time around.",
      "\"I remember reading press last season when we got them back together \u2014 not even press, but buzz, scanning social media comments. So many people were like, She better not hurt him again, or How is she going to hurt him?\" Zuritsky said.",
      "\"That was always ringing in my ears as a challenge,\" she added.",
      "Being aware ahead of time that Carrie and Aidan \"probably\" wouldn't last in \"AJLT\" forced the duo to wonder, \"How can we undo it in a way that left both of them with their dignity, their integrity, their love \u2014 and no one betrays anyone?\"",
      "Still, dealing with viewers' reactions always keeps the duo on their toes.",
      "\"It's wild! I can\u2019t think of another situation where people have a real ownership and possessiveness about the character \u2014 there\u2019s almost a blurring of the lines that they\u2019re people viewers know and feel protective of,\" explained Rottenberg.",
      "\"If we write a story that portrays Carrie in a certain light, people feel That\u2019s not my Carrie and Carrie would never put up with this,\" she added.",
      "Zuritsky chimed in to add, \"And sometimes there\u2019s discomfort around the fact that they haven\u2019t changed. I will read just as much snark about Carrie being just same old self as snark that she\u2019s changed too much.\"",

    "story": [
      "TikTok\u2019s newest trend features a gravity defying pose where users perch on a tall stack of random objects, while crossing their legs as they stand on one foot\u2026 in heels.",
      "Known as the \u201cNicki Minaj challenge,\u201d this viral moment is an elaborate balancing act. The challenge has taken over the internet, as the hashtag #nickiminajchallenge has been used over 115,000 times on TikTok alone.",
      "Creators have balanced on everything from Jenga blocks to soup cans. Many have found their own humorous, if not outrageous, ways to embrace the challenge and make it their own. Some have ridden on their kids' play cars while remaining in the pose, while others have used their pets to get in on the action.",
      "As the trend grows in popularity, some are wondering how it all started, and is it safe? Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Nicki Minaj challenge.",
      "Where Did the Nicki Minaj Challenge Come From?",
      "The trend is inspired by rapper Nicki Minaj\u2019s famous pose in the music video for the 2013 song \u201cHigh School\u201d ft. Lil Wayne. At the video\u2019s 34 second mark, Minaj stands by a swimming pool in stilettos, crouching low to the ground with one leg crossed over the other.",
      "In April, TikTok user @1jacore posted a video attempting to emulate Minaj. Since then, others followed suit, with many getting creative as they tried to channel the singer's impressive posture.",
      "Now, the trend has evolved beyond just completing Minaj\u2019s original pose. Users have taken the challenge to new heights, balancing on as many objects as possible, all while wearing a pair of high heels. The trend also appears to have become somewhat competitive, with some participants seemingly attempting to outdo one another with the most elaborate balancing act.",
      "For example, one user posted a video of herself on TikTok balancing on a tall stack of tables in her garden. In the video, she holds a hose in one hand and balances on an upside down flowerpot while in a pair of heels.",
      "Users have also recorded themselves balancing on champagne bottles, cakes and weights.",
      "On TODAY with Jenna & Friends July 24, Jenna Bush Hager and Willie Geist both attempted the trend. Jenna completed the pose on a stack of books with her July book club pick in hand and a pair of sunglasses on. Willie fulfilled the challenge by balancing on top of ceramic coffee mugs with a margarita in hand.",
      "Some attempts at the trend seem to defy physics and gravity. But as participants try to create the craziest take on the trend yet, they should also consider the safety implications behind completing such a stunt.",
      "Is the Nicki Minaj Challenge Safe?",
      "TODAY fitness contributor Stephanie Mansour tells TODAY.com that the Nicki Minaj challenge can be unsafe if the proper precautions are not taken.",
      "\u201cI never recommend working out in heels or balancing on one foot in heels, unless wearing them is part of the artistic nature of a workout,\u201d Mansour says.",
      "Balancing on unstable objects is risky, she adds. If the proper precautions are not taken, this challenge could be \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d",
      "While the challenge is still sweeping social media, Mansour offers her sobering take on whether fans should try to take it on.",
      "\u201cI hate to be the bearer of bad news over a fun TikTok trend,\u201d Mansour says, \u201cbut I really don\u2019t recommend that anyone seriously try this.\u201d",
      "How to Safely do the Nicki Minaj Challenge",
      "Even though the Nicki Minaj challenge is not \"recommended,\" there's still hope for those who want to join in on the fun. There are ways to safely complete the challenge and doing it might even have some benefits.",
      "Mansour says balancing workouts can be a great exercise to build strength.",
      "\u201cThis could be a great exercise to strengthen your glutes, hamstrings, quads, calf and the stabilizing muscles, tendons and ligaments surrounding your ankle, knee and hip joints,\u201d Mansour says, referring to the challenge.",
      "To complete the trend safely, Mansour recommends balancing on a stable surface, such as a level stack of books. She also says participants should make sure that what they are balancing on is wide enough, which will help them from tipping over.",
      "She says it also would be helpful to have past experience balancing on one foot on surfaces that are not elevated.",
      "After you have the right surface to balance on, and wear a pair of workout shoes, your risk of injury is lower.",
      "Now, all that's left for you to do is bring your own personality to the trend and see what creative items you can grab to feature in your pose."

      "For the new superhero flick, which hit theaters July 25, Pedro Pascal steps into the role of Reed Richards while Vanessa Kirby plays Sue Storm. Completing the family are Joseph Quinn\u2019s Johnny Storm, Sue\u2019s brother, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach\u2019s character Ben Grimm, Reed\u2019s close friend.",
      "Straying from the early 2000s \u201cFantastic Four\u201d films and the widely panned 2015 reboot, this time comic book fans meet Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben on Earth-828 circa the early 1960s, as evident by the movie\u2019s glossy retro-futuristic style.",
      "The film breezes past the characters\u2019 origin stories, showing in flashbacks how their previous trip to space resulted in them returning to Earth with superpowers. But the beloved heroes of this world are rattled when one day the Silver Surfer, played by Julia Garner, descends from the sky and announces to the quartet, and the world, that their planet is marked for death. She tells them that Earth will be consumed by a colossal being known as Galactus, voiced by Ralph Ineson.",

Galactus had asked the couple to sacrifice their child to him and in exchange he would leave their planet alone. He reveals that Franklin has special abilities that would eliminate the giant\u2019s insatiable hunger, even though Reed\u2019s multiple tests appeared to confirm the baby lacked superpowers.",
      "Instead of giving into Galactus\u2019 demand, the quartet outsmart him by luring the entity into a trap. However, the plan goes awry and Sue has to use all her strength to create a force field strong enough to push Galactus into a portal that sends him to a far part of the galaxy.",
      "Sue dies but when Reed places Franklin on top of her, the boy suddenly revives her.",

Sue finishes reading a book to Franklin in the Fantastic Four\u2019s penthouse apartment, located at the Baxter Building, before she goes into another room to grab a second novel.",
      "When she returns to the living room, she senses something is wrong and spots Doctor Doom leaning over the child. Although the villain has his mask removed in the scene and holds it in his hand, his face is not shown. Marvel has previously announced that Robert Downey Jr., who portrayed Iron Man, will re-join the MCU as Doctor Doom.",
      "The flick then cuts to a black screen with text that reads, \u201cThe Fantastic Four will return in \u2018Avengers: Doomsday.\u2019\u201d",
      "Once all the credits conclude, the film officially ends with a snippet from the 1967 \u201cFantastic Four\u201d cartoon. There is also a quote from Jack Kirby, who co-created the Fantastic Four with the late Stan Lee, as well as many other comic book characters prior to his death in 1994. The quote from Kirby says, \u201cIf you look at my characters, you will find me. No matter what kind of character you create or assume, a little of yourself must remain there.\u201d",
      "How does the post-credit scene impact \u2018Avengers: Doomsday\u2019?",
      "Doctor Doom finally making an appearance in a Marvel film isn\u2019t that surprising given that he will be the main \u201cBig Bad\u201d for this phase of the MCU and that he is one of the Fantastic Four\u2019s biggest adversaries. Plus, Pascal, Kirby, Quinn and Moss-Bachrach were previously announced as \u201cAvengers: Doomsday\u201d cast members in March.",
      "However, as mentioned, \u201cFirst Steps\u201d is set in the 1960s, decades before the timelines of Marvel\u2019s other films this year, like \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d and \u201cThunderbolts*.\u201d So, Doctor Doom popping up in this movie could suggest there will be some type of time travel element at the center of \u201cAvengers: Doomsday.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Three Venezuelan men told NBC News they experienced physical and psychological torture, including one man\u2019s allegation that he was sexually assaulted, after the Trump administration sent them to a notorious prison in El Salvador.",
      "The men were held for four months in the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a Salvadoran megaprison known for its harsh conditions and reported abuse. The allegations included beatings that left bruises and cuts, psychological abuse and the denial of necessities such as food or bathroom access.",
      "The Trump administration sent about 250 Venezuelan men to CECOT in March and has accused them of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Many of the men and some of their families and attorneys have denied the claim. The men were released and flown to Venezuela on July 18 as part of a prisoner swap with the United States.",
      "Andry Hernandez Romero, a 32-year-old gay asylum-seeker from Venezuela, told NBC News that one day during his imprisonment he was taken to solitary confinement, where prison staff \u201cmade me kneel, perform oral sex on one person, while the others groped me and touched my private parts\u201d and \u201cstroked me with their batons.\u201d",
      "He said he could not identify the guards because their faces were covered and the room did not have a lightbulb, with only a small amount of light coming in through a hole in the ceiling.",
      "Hernandez said the incident left him devastated.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to eat. I didn\u2019t want to do absolutely anything,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThe only thing I did was stay laying down, look at the toilet, remember my family, asking myself a million questions.\u201d",
      "Another detainee who spoke to NBC News, Jerce Reyes, said Hernandez told him after they were released that he was sexually abused by CECOT staff. Hernandez also said on Venezuelan state media that he was sexually abused while in CECOT.",
      "\u201cHe told us that when we arrived in Venezuela, that he suffered abuse at the hands of guards there in El Salvador,\u201d said Reyes, referring to Hernandez\u2019s account of sexual abuse.",
      "Hernandez said he was unaware of any formal system at CECOT through which he could report the alleged abuse and that if detainees tried to complain to superiors at the prison, they would often be subjected to beatings by guards.",
      "The Salvadoran government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hernandez\u2019s sexual assault allegations and claims from other Venezuelan men that they were physically and psychologically abused in the prison. The government has previously said it observes safety and order standards, and the director of CECOT told CNN that \u201cthe whole operation is based on strict respect for human rights.\u201d In a statement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security referred NBC News to the Salvadoran government for comment because the Venezuelan men were \u201cnot U.S. citizens or under U.S. jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "When asked whether the U.S. government would continue to send people to CECOT, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, \u201cwhether it is CECOT, Alligator Alcatraz, Guantanamo Bay or another detention facility, these dangerous criminals will not be allowed to terrorize U.S. citizens.\u201d",
      "The statement said that President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u201care using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens off our streets and out of our country. Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u2018You will not be leaving here\u2019",
      "Hernandez and others said they were repeatedly beaten by prison officials.",
      "\u201cOur daily bread there as Venezuelans were beatings, threats. For whatever circumstance,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIf you answer an official, they hit you. ... If you talk, they hit you.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery time they went to hit a large group outside, they would put us in the required position so we couldn\u2019t see. And to hear the moans, to hear how they were hitting the people was also very heavy.\u201d",
      "Another detainee, Andry Blanco Bonilla, 40, said he and the other Venezuelans faced verbal, psychological and physical abuse from the day they entered CECOT.",
      "\u201cThere were so many moments of anguish and terror,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cI feared for my life.\u201d",
      "Blanco Bonilla said that when they first arrived at CECOT, the men were shackled so tightly at the ankles that walking \u201cwould give us cuts and bruises.\u201d He said the guards denied them food and access to bathrooms or showers as punishment.",
      "Blanco Bonilla, who had gone to the U.S. to seek asylum, said he would never forget the words of a prison official who told the detainees, \u201cWelcome to CECOT. Welcome to hell.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou will not be leaving here. Your days are over,\u201d the official said, according to Blanco Bonilla.",
      "The detainees would suffer beatings as the guards saw fit, he said.",
      "\u201cThey tried to avoid hitting our faces. They kicked us in the back or ribs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they made us get on our knees, they would step on our toes with their boots. They hit us with batons, they hit us on the head.\u201d",
      "After a beating, Blanco Bonilla said he would be brought by guards to a prison doctor, who would say to him, \u201cYou hit yourself. How did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "When he tried to tell the doctor that he was beaten by prison staff, a guard would hit him with a baton in the back, Blanco Bonilla said. The doctor would then ask him again, \u201cHow did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized that if I didn\u2019t tell them what they wanted, they would keep hitting me,\u201d he said, adding that the doctor would then make a false report about the incident.",
      "\u2018We are only migrants\u2019",
      "Reyes, 36, said one of hardest moments for him was when a prison official \u201cencouraged us to commit suicide\u201d and told him \u201cthis is how your whole nightmare ends.\u201d",
      "\u201cI did think about committing suicide at some point. But I thought about my two daughters, I thought about my family,\u201d he said about his two children, ages 3 and 6.",
      "Reyes said there were days when \u201cwe woke up and all said to ourselves, \u2018We aren\u2019t getting out of here.\u2019\u201d He said he witnessed and experienced physical aggression from CECOT guards.",
      "Reyes said he was thankful that he and other men were able to share copies of the Bible inside and motivate each other.",
      "The detainees who spoke to NBC News said they had no contact with the outside world or access to U.S. officials during the four months they were held in CECOT.",
      "Reyes did recall seeing Noem walk by when she toured CECOT in March, shortly after he and the others were sent there. She went past several cells that Salvadoran officials assured her held hardened criminals and gang members.",
      "Reyes says he wasn\u2019t told Noem was coming but remembers that day as the only day the detainees had gotten something cold to drink.",
      "He said he and others pressed their faces to the bars and saw her. \u201cWe began screaming, \u2018Freedom, freedom, freedom. We are not criminals. We are only migrants,\u2019\u201d Reyes said.",
      "The men were sent to CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March, declaring the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua an invading force. Immigration officials have since used that act to deport hundreds of people without immigration hearings, alleging that they were gang members.",
      "The men who spoke to NBC News, as well as the families of former detainees and their attorneys, have strongly denied any ties to gangs and said they were unfairly targeted because of tattoos that may be popular in Venezuela and are unrelated to Tren de Aragua. They have also said some migrants were denied due process and a chance to defend themselves from the accusations against them. Experts have said tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua. An official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement previously said the administration did not solely rely on tattoos to identify the men sent to CECOT as gang members.",
      "A New York Times investigation, which relied on interviews with prosecutors and law enforcement officials as well as court documents and media reports in multiple countries, found that most of the men sent to CECOT did not have criminal records in the United States or in the region. It found at least 32 of the more than 200 men faced serious criminal accusations or convictions in the United States or abroad. Very few of them appeared to have any documented evidence connecting them to Tren de Aragua.",
      "The men said their strong faith in God, love for their families and a belief that one day they would get justice helped them keep going during their most desperate moments.",
      "\u201cReuniting again with my parents and children was a moment of such happiness,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "While the men resume life back in Venezuela, the question of whether they would ever return to the U.S. remains. During a status hearing Thursday tied to the government\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act, the Department of Justice said it would bring any of the men back for immigration or habeas proceedings if a \u201clawful order\u201d were issued.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has made assurances they\u2019ll allow us to do that,\u201d DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis told the court.",
      "Now that they are back home with their families, the men have said they are demanding justice from Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "On Thursday, former detainee Neiyerver Adri\u00e1n Leon Rengel filed a complaint, reviewed by NBC News, against the Department of Homeland Security under the Federal Tort Claims Act, claiming he was removed from the United States unlawfully and without due process. The complaint was filed on behalf Rengel by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Democracy Defenders Fund, which describes itself as a nonpartisan group that defends democratic institutions and opposes autocrats.",
      "LULAC told NBC News that it also planned to file a lawsuit and expected more lawsuits to come after that.",
      "Rengel alleged that he suffered physical, verbal and psychological abuse in CECOT and that the U.S. government could have and should have secured his release, according to the complaint.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the complaint.",
      "\u201cWe were mistreated, our rights were violated, crimes against humanity were committed,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "Hernandez said he and others are still working through the psychological effects of their time in CECOT. \u201cAll 252 [of the men] are doing poorly, mentally.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though we are free, even though we are now with our families, happy and content,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is still a big mental block, a block that particularly I have not been able to find a way to deal with.\u201d",
      "But despite their ongoing struggles, Hernandez said the shared experience has created a lasting sense of community among the men.",
      "\u201cWe entered [CECOT] as 252 strangers, 252 Venezuelans, but 252 brothers came out,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe all supported each other; we were all there in the constant fight.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The new trickle of aid Israel has allowed into Gaza is not enough to stave off famine, aid groups have warned, as a new round of \"tactical pauses\" were set to take place Monday.",
      "The partial easing of restrictions comes amid mounting global outrage over rising deaths and scenes of starvation under Israel's military offensive on the Palestinian enclave it has besieged.",
      "\u201cThis is progress, but vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health crisis,\u201d United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher warned in a statement Sunday after Israel announced a pause in military operations in certain areas for 10 hours daily.",
      "Sunday's aid deliveries were a \"drop in the ocean\" and the days ahead will be \"make or break\" in addressing the hunger crisis, Fletcher told British broadcaster BBC News on Monday.",
      "His warnings were echoed by others as the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave said Monday that 14 new deaths over the past 24 hours were attributed to \u201cfamine and malnutrition,\u201d with two children among those killed.",
      "That brought the total number of deaths due to malnutrition up to 147, including 88 children, since the war began, the health ministry said, with most of those recorded in recent months, according to statements from the United Nations. NBC News was not able to independently confirm the figures.",
      "Humanitarian groups and doctors have warned for weeks of  mounting malnutrition in Gaza, with Israel allowing only a \u201cbasic\u201d amount of food in since May when it lifted its weekslong blockade barring the entry of aid into the enclave.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this needs to be a lot bigger and immediate to be able to make any dent,\u201d Beckie Ryan, response director in Gaza for CARE, a humanitarian agency working to address global hunger, said in a phone interview Monday morning,",
      "Ryan expressed some optimism but added that a ceasefire would be the best way to address the spiraling hunger crisis.",
      "Just under 30 aid packages carrying food were airdropped over Gaza on Sunday, COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, said in a statement.",
      "Video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed scores of Palestinians running toward a handful of parachutes dotting the sky in northern Gaza, which COGAT said was airdropped in collaboration with the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.",
      "Meanwhile, Palestinians could could also be seen carrying bags of flour slung over their shoulders after more than 120 trucks carrying aid were collected and distributed by the U.N. and other aid organizations, according to COGAT.",
      "Abdul Rahman Al-Kahlout, 18, said he waited for hours under the blazing sun in hope of reaching the supplies before they ran out.",
      "\"We died in the sun for four hours,\" Al-Kahlout said. He described shots being fired and soldiers surrounding Palestinians as they waited for the aid several times. He said he feared he was \"going to die for flour.\"",
      "More than 1,000 people, including children, have been killed by Israeli forces while waiting for and trying to reach aid since a new aid distribution system was implemented in late May, led by the controversial U.S. and Israel-backed group the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Health officials in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed at least 41 Palestinians from late Saturday into Sunday, including 26 people who were seeking aid, The Associated Press reported.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that he believes there is no way for Israel to safely negotiate an end to the war with Hamas and that Israel would take over Gaza, comparing the move to U.S. actions at the end of World War II.",
      "Graham said he believed Israel has concluded \u201cthat they can\u2019t achieve a goal of ending the war with Hamas that would be satisfactory to the safety of Israel.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think President Trump has come to believe, and I certainly have come to believe, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to negotiate an end of this war with Hamas,\u201d Graham said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to do in Gaza what we did in Tokyo and Berlin, take the place by force and start over again, presenting a better future for the Palestinians, hopefully having the Arabs take over the West Bank and Gaza,\u201d he later added.",
      "His comments come as Israel is facing mounting international pressure over a growing hunger crisis in Gaza, where at least 133 people have died by starvation, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. On Sunday, Israel announced a pause in fighting in parts of Gaza to facilitate aid delivery.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said that Israel was \u201cmoving toward full control\u201d of Gaza.

      "These claims came to the fore last week when Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard alleged during a press briefing that the former president participated in a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d to harm Trump\u2019s campaign.",
      "Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush has said that the \u201cbizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\u201d NBC News has also reported that former CIA officer Susan Miller, who helped lead the team that produced a report on Russia\u2019s actions during the 2016 election, defended the report and said the White House was \u201clying\u201d about it.",
      "Graham said Sunday that \u201cthe best way to handle this is if there is evidence of a crime being committed, or suspected evidence of a crime being committed, create a special counsel to look at it.\u201d",
      "A special counsel had previously been appointed during the first Trump administration to examine the origins of the Russia probe, and in 2023, then-special counsel John Durham argued that certain FBI personnel \u201cdisplayed a serious lack of analytical rigor toward the information they received.\u201d",
      "A 2020 Senate report backed up the assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, with the then-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, a Republican, saying: \u201cThe Committee found no reason to dispute the Intelligence Community\u2019s conclusions.\u201d",

      "Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team hypothesized that it was killed and eaten or consumed through scavenging by a medium sized caiman, a crocodile-like reptile.",
      "\u201cThis is a fascinating story of the interaction of two very iconic animals in the past,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Link, the study\u2019s lead author, told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe actually found not only the first record of a terror bird in northern south America, but the tooth marks of a large caiman that has probably fed on it,\u201d he added.",
      "Terror bird fossils, which are rare, have mostly been identified in the southern part of the continent.",
      "While tooth marks are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in the fossil record, it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d to find evidence that indicates an apex predator being hunted or scavenged by another, said Link, an associate professor of  biological sciences at the Los Andes University in Colombia.",
      "Writing in \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team said the teeth marks showed no signs of healing, suggesting that the attack was fatal.",
      "Based on the finding, they added that terror birds might have faced higher risk of being killed and eaten than previously expected.",
      "To identify the attacker, Link and his team scanned the fossil and analyzed the size, shape and spacing of the tooth marks. After comparing those marks with teeth of crocodyliforms from the region, they concluded that the trace maker was likely a juvenile caiman about 15 feet long.",
      "It remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know if the caiman ate the terror bird after killing it or whether it scavenged the carcass, Link said. If the bird was alive, it was likely attacked while drinking at a river, researchers wrote, and conversely, if it was dead, the caiman found and fed on its body near water.",
      "\u201cThis story will not be told completely as we have no further evidence to choose between these two hypotheses.\u201d Link said.",
      "The discovery challenges the assumption of \u201ca linear relation between predators feeding on herbivores feeding in plants,\u201d he added. \u201cThe food web is really much more complex.\u201d",
      "The lower part of the bird\u2019s left leg bone used in the study was unearthed in the renowned La Venta fossil beds of Colombia two decades ago by Cesar Perdomo, a local paleontologist."

      "Indeed, this year\u2019s Tour was filled with unforgettable performances by the next generation of emerging talent.",
      "Few people could have predicted the rise of Irish climber Ben Healy, who wore the yellow jersey for two days early in the race after launching strong attacks based purely on instinct. His team, EF Education-EasyPost, came into the race without its team leader, Richard Carapaz, but Healy quickly stepped into the role.

The Belgian fastman was forced to abandon with a fractured collarbone and at least one broken rib.",
      "Milan and teammate Quinn Simmons, from Durango, Colorado, soon began a relentless campaign to best the remaining sprinters and succeeded.

He proved to be the perfect lead-out man for Milan, who wouldn\u2019t let rain or crashes slow him down.",

      "Before one of its planes crashed just after takeoff last month, killing at least 260 people, Air India had been a symbol of the country\u2019s global rise.",
      "Only two years earlier, chief executive Campbell Wilson had inaugurated a brand-new Airbus A350, Air India\u2019s first, calling it \u201ca declaration of Indian aviation\u2019s resurgence on the world stage.\u201d",
      "The aircraft\u2019s delivery made headlines across the country, where the public cheered Air India\u2019s transformation from a neglected state-owned flagship carrier into a modern airline that its new owners, the Tata Group, hoped would become the world\u2019s biggest.",
      "Under the Indian conglomerate, which founded the airline in 1932  and bought it back in 2022 after it spent decades under government operation, Air India was making big moves, announcing a record order in 2023 of 470 aircraft valued at more than $70 billion.",
      "A year later, the airline said it had begun a $400 million retrofit of its legacy fleet, accelerating the upgrade by leasing jets from other airlines, including Delta.",
      "That momentum came to a grinding halt last month when a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed seconds after takeoff in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard plus 19 others on the ground in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "Air India has since been under immense pressure to answer for the crash, but bereaved families were left with more questions after investigators released a preliminary report this month that said the plane\u2019s fuel switches had been wrongly cut off, leading to speculation that one of the pilots might have done it accidentally or even intentionally.",
      "Indian investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is involved in the crash investigation as the aircraft is U.S.-made, said such conclusions were irresponsible.",
      "\u201cInvestigations of this magnitude take time,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said, while India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau urged the public and the media to \u201crefrain from spreading premature narratives.\u201d",
      "But Indian commentators were already irate.",
      "\u201cWhy do this rumor mill mongering about possible problems with the pilot?\u201d Arnab Goswami, a firebrand anchor, said on his conservative Republic Media Network. \u201cSo that across the world the impression goes that Indian pilots cannot fly?\u201d",
      "Capt. C.S. Randhawa, a former pilot for Air India and the Indian air force, said the suggestion that one of the pilots may have crashed the plane deliberately has \u201cdemoralized the pilots in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll pilots are up in arms, and it\u2019s not a good thing. The pilots have to fly with that mental attitude,\u201d Randhawa, who is currently the president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told NBC News.",
      "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that the crash did not appear to have been caused by a mechanical issue with the Boeing fuel control unit. The final report is due next year.",
      "On top of the lack of clarity, some British families hoping to bury their loved ones said they had received the remains of the wrong people, according to the Daily Mail, which cited a lawyer representing them. The Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday that all remains were being handled with \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d and that it was working closely with the British side to address concerns.",
      "Air India was also warned last week by India\u2019s aviation regulator that it could face enforcement action over more than two dozen safety violations from this year and last year, Reuters reported, citing government notices. They include pilots not being given mandatory rest and poor compliance with simulator training requirements.",
      "The airline, which voluntarily disclosed the problems last month, said Friday that it would respond to the regulator and that it \u201cremains fully committed to ensuring the safety of its passengers and staff.\u201d",
      "Air India was already under enormous pressure to clean up its reputation after falling into disrepair during its nearly 70 years of government ownership. Its reform nevertheless aligned perfectly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s nationalist narrative of turning India into a global superpower.",
      "\u201cGiven its legacy, the brand remains synonymous with India,\u201d said Shelley Vishwajeet, a New Delhi-based aviation journalist and  author of \u201cThe IndiGo Story,\u201d a book about the Indian airline. He added that the cultural transformation within Air India \u201chas been a challenge\u201d for its new owners.",
      "Things moved quickly after the takeover by the Tata Group, which consolidated several airlines it controlled, including Vistara and Air Asia India, into two entities: the full-cost carrier Air India and its budget arm, Air India Express.",
      "Vistara, which was partly owned by Singapore Airlines, was particularly beloved by Indians, known for its modern planes and best-in-class customer experience. When it merged with Air India, travelers and crew hoped that Air India would be the true Vistara successor.",
      "But Air India has struggled to deliver change as fast as some had hoped.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re struggling with maintenance issues, disrepair issues, and all these things are taking time,\u201d Randhawa said."

      "Israeli gunfire and airstrikes killed more than 50 Palestinians in Gaza on Saturday, including some who were waiting overnight for aid, according to local health officials, continuing a pattern that has drawn international criticism as the country\u2019s \u201cdrip-feeding of aid\u201d into the enclave continues to claim lives.",
      "Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, said at least 61 people were killed in Gaza so far this weekend, including those waiting in line for aid at the Zikim crossing with Israel, \u201ca number of starving children\u201d and a group recovered in southern Khan Younis.",
      "In the Zikim area, at least a dozen were killed as they waited for aid trucks, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The latest killings near an aid distribution site come amid what many have described as Israel\u2019s \u201cdrip-feeding of aid\u201d into Gaza, a tactic that has contributed to more than 120 deaths from malnutrition and left a third of the population on the brink of starvation.",
      "The criticism is disputed by the Israeli military, which says it has allowed in an average of 70 trucks a day since May. But aid agencies say hundreds more trucks a day are necessary to feed Gaza\u2019s starving population.",
      "Late Saturday, Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry announced that a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d will be observed Sunday morning in Gaza to allow aid to reach civilian centers.",
      "Five deaths due to malnutrition were recorded in Gaza in the last 24 hours, the Palestinian Health Ministry in the territory said on Saturday. At least 127 people, including 85 children, have died as a result of hunger in the enclave since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the ministry.",
      "Earlier this week, 25 countries, including Britain, Japan and a host of European nations, issued a joint statement insisting that the war in Gaza \u201cmust end now.\u201d",
      "The foreign ministers of the nations called the recent killings of Palestinians seeking aid \u201chorrific,\u201d which Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry and the U.N. human rights office estimate to be over 800.",
      "The latest prior instance involved the killing of at least 67 people as they waited for U.N. aid trucks in northern Gaza on Sunday.",
      "Israel said its military had fired warning shots into the crowd to remove \u201can immediate threat,\u201d adding that casualty reports were inflated.",
      "The Israeli military, which controls the entry of all aid into the besieged enclave, blames the U.N. and other aid agencies for failing to distribute the supplies.",
      "U.N. spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric told reporters this week that there was \u201ca lack of willingness\u201d from Israel to allow them to distribute aid.",
      "Israel has accused Hamas of stealing U.S.-funded aid, citing that as a main rationale, along with the U.S., for proposing a new armed, private aid operation. But an investigation by the U.S. Agency for International Development found \u201cno reports alleging Hamas\u201d benefited from U.S.-funded supplies.",
      "In a statement, the IDF said USAID\u2019s report ignores \u201cclear and explicit evidence that Hamas exploits humanitarian aid to sustain its fighting capabilities,\u201d and criticizes the military \u201cfor routing decisions made specifically to protect humanitarian staff and shipments.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe USAID report represents a striking example of biased framing,\u201d the IDF said. \u201cInstead of holding Hamas and other terror groups accountable for looting and obstructing aid from reaching the population, it assigns \u2018indirect responsibility\u2019 to Israel for the actions of armed militants and terror organizations.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 As President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs add to a sense of uncertainty in Japan, more voters here are embracing an idea inspired by their longtime ally the United States: \u201cJapanese first.\u201d",
      "The nationalist slogan helped the right-wing populist party Sanseito make big gains in Japan\u2019s parliamentary elections on Sunday, as it capitalized on economic malaise and concerns about immigration and overtourism.",
      "Party leader Sohei Kamiya, who since 2022 had held Sanseito\u2019s only seat in the upper house of Japan\u2019s parliament, will now be joined by 14 others in the 248-seat chamber. It\u2019s a far cry from the party\u2019s origin as a fringe anti-vaccination group on YouTube during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Though Japan has long had a complex relationship with foreigners and its cultural identity, experts say Sanseito\u2019s rise is another indication of the global shift to the right embodied and partly fueled by Trump, with populist figures gaining ground in Europe, Britain, Latin America and elsewhere.",
      "Kamiya \u201cfancies himself a mini-Trump\u201d and \u201cis one of those who Trump has put wind in his sails,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "Speaking at a rally on Saturday at Tokyo\u2019s Shiba Park, Kamiya said his calls for greater restrictions on foreign workers and investment were driven not by xenophobia but by \u201cthe workings of globalization.\u201d He criticized mainstream parties\u2019 support for boosting immigration in an effort to address the labor shortage facing Japan\u2019s aging and shrinking population.",
      "\u201cJapan is still the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have 120 million people. Why do we have to rely on foreign capital?\u201d Kamiya told an enthusiastic crowd.",
      "The election results were disastrous for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is facing calls to resign now that his conservative Liberal Democratic Party \u2014 which has ruled almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II \u2014 has lost its majority in both houses of parliament.",
      "The Japanese leader had also been under pressure to reach a trade deal with the Trump administration, which said Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods.",
      "On Wednesday, Ishiba denied reports that he planned to step down by the end of August.",
      "The message from his party\u2019s string of election losses is that \u201cpeople are unhappy,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel that the status quo is biased against their interests and it advantages the elderly over the young, and the young feel sort of resentful that they\u2019re having to carry the heavy burden of the growing aging population on their back,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamiya, 47, an energetic speaker with social media savvy, is also a strong contrast to leaders such as Ishiba and the Constitutional Democrats\u2019 Yoshihiko Noda, both 68, who \u201clook like yesterday\u2019s men\u201d and the faces of the establishment, Kingston said.",
      "With voters concerned about stagnating wages, surging prices and bleak employment prospects, \u201cthe change-makers got a lot of protest votes from people who feel disenfranchised,\u201d he said.",
      "Sanseito\u2019s platform resonated with voters such as Yuta Kato.",
      "\u201cThe number of [foreign immigrants] who don\u2019t obey rules is increasing. People don\u2019t voice it, but I think they feel that,\u201d the 38-year-old hairdresser told Reuters in Tokyo. \u201cAlso, the burden on citizens including taxes is getting bigger and bigger, so life is getting more difficult.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason Sanseito did well in the election, he said, \u201cis that they are speaking on behalf of us.\u201d",
      "Kamiya\u2019s party was not the only upstart to benefit from voter discontent, with the center-right Democratic Party for the People increasing its number of seats in the upper house from five to 16.",
      "Sanseito, whose name means \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d originated in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, attracting conservatives with YouTube videos promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines and pushing back against mask mandates. Its YouTube channel now has almost 480,000 subscribers.",
      "The party has also warned about a \u201csilent invasion\u201d of foreigners in Japan, where the number of foreign residents rose more than 10% last year to a record of almost 3.8 million, according to the Immigration Services Agency. It remains far lower as a proportion of the population than in the U.S. or Europe, however.",
      "Critics say such rhetoric has fueled hate speech and growing hostility toward foreigners in Japan, citing a survey last month by Japanese broadcaster NHK and others in which almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that foreigners received \u201cpreferential treatment.\u201d",
      "At the Sanseito rally on Saturday, protesters held up signs that said \u201cNo Hate\u201d and \u201cRacists Go Home.\u201d",
      "Kamiya denies that his party is hostile to foreigners in Japan.",
      "\u201cWe have no intention of discriminating against foreigners, nor do we have any intention of inciting division,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just aiming to firmly rebuild the lives of Japanese people who are currently in trouble.\u201d",
      "Despite its electoral advances, Sanseito doesn\u2019t have enough members in the upper house to make much impact on its own and has only three seats in the more powerful lower house. The challenge, Kingston said, is whether Kamiya can \u201ctake this anger, the malaise, and bring his show nationwide.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An internal U.S. government analysis found no evidence of systematic theft by the Palestinian militant group Hamas of U.S.-funded humanitarian supplies, challenging the main rationale that Israel and the U.S. give for backing a new armed private aid operation.",
      "The analysis, which has not been previously reported, was conducted by a bureau within the U.S. Agency for International Development and completed in late June. It examined 156 incidents of theft or loss of U.S.-funded supplies reported by U.S. aid partner organizations between October 2023 and this May.",
      "It found \u201cno reports alleging Hamas\u201d benefited from U.S.-funded supplies, according to a slide presentation of the findings seen by Reuters.",
      "A State Department spokesperson disputed the findings, saying there is video evidence of Hamas looting aid, but provided no such videos. The spokesperson also accused traditional humanitarian groups of covering up \u201caid corruption.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, questioned the existence of the analysis, saying no State Department official had seen it and that it \u201cwas likely produced by a deep state operative\u201d seeking to discredit President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chumanitarian agenda.\u201d",
      "The findings were shared with the USAID\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office and State Department officials involved in Middle East policy, said two sources familiar with the matter, and come as dire food shortages deepen in the devastated enclave.",
      "Israel says it is committed to allowing in aid but must control it to prevent it from being stolen by Hamas, which it blames for the crisis.",
      "The U.N. World Food Program says nearly a quarter of Gaza\u2019s 2.1 million Palestinians face famine-like conditions, thousands are suffering acute malnutrition, and the World Health Organization and doctors in the enclave report starvation deaths of children and others.",
      "The U.N. also estimates that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 people seeking food supplies, the majority near the militarized distribution sites of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the new private aid group that uses a for-profit U.S. logistics firm run by a former CIA officer and armed U.S. military veterans.",
      "The study was conducted by the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) of USAID, which was the largest funder of assistance to Gaza before the Trump administration froze all U.S. foreign aid in January, terminating thousands of programs. It has also begun dismantling USAID, whose functions have been folded into the State Department.",
      "The analysis found that at least 44 of the 156 incidents where aid supplies were reported stolen or lost were \u201ceither directly or indirectly\u201d due to Israeli military actions, according to the briefing slides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military did not respond to questions about those findings.",
      "The study noted a limitation: because Palestinians who receive aid cannot be vetted, it was possible that U.S.-funded supplies went to administrative officials of Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza.",
      "One source familiar with the study also cautioned that the absence of reports of widespread aid diversion by Hamas \u201cdoes not mean that diversion has not occurred.\u201d",
      "The war in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Nearly 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli assault began, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel says Hamas diverts aid",
      "Israel, which controls access to Gaza, has said that Hamas steals food supplies from U.N. and other organizations to use to control the civilian population and boost its finances, including by jacking up the prices of the goods and reselling them to civilians.",
      "Asked about the USAID report, the Israeli military told Reuters that its allegations are based on intelligence reports that Hamas militants seized cargoes by \u201cboth covertly and overtly\u201d embedding themselves on aid trucks.",
      "Those reports also show that Hamas has diverted up to 25% of aid supplies to its fighters or sold them to civilians, the Israeli military said, adding that GHF has ended the militants\u2019 control of aid by distributing it directly to civilians.",
      "Hamas denies the allegations. A Hamas security official said that Israel has killed more than 800 Hamas-affiliated police and security guards trying to protect aid vehicles and convoy routes. Their missions were coordinated with the U.N.",
      "Reuters could not independently verify the claims by Hamas and Israel, which has not made public proof that the militants have systematically stolen aid.",
      "GHF also accuses Hamas of massive aid theft in defending its distribution model. The U.N. and other groups have rejected calls by GHF, Israel and the U.S. to cooperate with the foundation, saying it violates international humanitarian principles of neutrality.",
      "In response to a request for comment, GHF referred Reuters to a July 2 Washington Post article that quoted an unidentified Gazan and anonymous Israeli officials as saying Hamas profited from the sales and taxing of pilfered humanitarian aid.",
      "Aid groups required to report losses",
      "The 156 reports of theft or losses of supplies reviewed by BHA were filed by U.N. agencies and other humanitarian groups working in Gaza as a condition of receiving U.S. aid funds.",
      "The second source familiar with the matter said that after receiving reports of U.S.-funded aid thefts or losses, USAID staff followed up with partner organizations to try to determine if there was Hamas involvement.",
      "Those organizations also would \u201credirect or pause\u201d aid distributions if they learned that Hamas was in the vicinity, the source said.",
      "Aid organizations working in Gaza also are required to vet their personnel, sub-contractors and suppliers for ties to extremist groups before receiving U.S. funds, a condition that the State Department waived in approving $30 million for GHF last month.",
      "The slide presentation noted that USAID partners tended to over-report aid diversion and theft by groups sanctioned or designated by the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations \u2014 such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad \u2014 because they want to avoid losing U.S. funding.",
      "Of the 156 incidents of loss or theft reported, 63 were attributed to unknown perpetrators, 35 to armed actors, 25 to unarmed people, 11 directly to Israeli military action, 11 to corrupt subcontractors, five to aid group personnel \u201cengaging in corrupt activities,\u201d and six to \u201cothers,\u201d a category that accounted for \u201ccommodities stolen in unknown circumstances,\u201d according to the slide presentation.",
      "The armed actors \u201cincluded gangs and other miscellaneous individuals who may have had weapons,\u201d said a slide. Another slide said \u201ca review of all 156 incidents found no affiliations with\u201d U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations, of which Hamas is one.",
      "\u201cThe majority of incidents could not be definitively attributed to a specific actor,\u201d said another slide. \u201cPartners often largely discovered the commodities had been stolen in transit without identifying the perpetrator.\u201d",
      "It is possible there were classified intelligence reports on Hamas aid thefts, but BHA staff lost access to classified systems in the dismantlement of USAID, said a slide.",
      "However, a source familiar with U.S. intelligence assessments told Reuters that they knew of no U.S. intelligence reports detailing Hamas aid diversions and that Washington was relying on Israeli reports.",
      "The BHA analysis found that the Israeli military \u201cdirectly or indirectly caused\u201d a total of 44 incidents in which U.S.-funded aid was lost or stolen. Those included the 11 attributed to direct Israeli military actions, such as airstrikes or orders to Palestinians to evacuate areas of the war-torn enclave.",
      "Losses indirectly attributed to Israeli military included cases where they compelled aid groups to use delivery routes with high risks of theft or looting, ignoring requests for alternative routes, the analysis said."

      "In the past 24 hours, hospitals in Gaza recorded nine deaths from malnutrition, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Friday in a statement, bringing the total number of deaths from malnutrition since the start of the war to 122, including 83 children.",
      "Sela is malnourished and has lost all her muscle and fat, said Dr. Ahmad Al-Fara, head of the hospital\u2019s pediatric department, adding that she suffered from vitamin D and iron deficiencies.",
      "\u201cShe is one of the extreme examples of malnutrition,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is just only the skin over the bone.\u201d",
      "Barbakh said she brought Sela to the hospital 10 days ago, after her family ran out of food and water.",
      "\u201cI was breastfeeding her naturally at first, but eventually, I stopped producing milk,\u201d she said, because \u201cI had no food or water to nourish myself.\u201d",
      "She switched to formula, \u201cbut now that is also unavailable.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the United Nations Population Fund, or UNFPA, its sexual and reproductive health agency, said the humanitarian situation unfolding in Gaza was leading to \u201ccatastrophic birth outcomes for pregnant women and newborns, threatening the survival of an entire generation.\u201d",
      "Citing new data from Gaza's health ministry, the UNFPA found that the number of babies born in Gaza had sharply declined in the first six months of the year, dropping by 41% \u2014 from 29,000 births in the same period in 2022 to 17,000.",
      "Many of the newborns are in a state of crisis. At least 20 babies have died within 24 hours of birth, UNFPA said, while 33% were born prematurely, underweight or required admission to neonatal intensive care.",
      "Another U.N. report published Thursday said that 9% of Gaza\u2019s children are severely malnourished.",
      "\u201cWe are now witnessing a deadly surge in malnutrition-related deaths,\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press briefing Wednesday, adding that since July 17, severe acute malnutrition centers are full, \"without sufficient supplies for emergency feeding.\u201d",
      "Barbakh, who was displaced from her home in Khan Younis and now lives in a cramped tent with six other family members, said food in Gaza has become extremely scarce, and what little is available in the markets is exorbitantly expensive.",
      "\u201cA single can of formula milk costs 170 shekels ($51), and I cannot afford it for my daughter,\u201d she said.",
      "Another of the malnourished babies in Nasser Hospital was 5-month-old Ramaa, wearing a pink floral dress that crumpled around her slight frame.",
      "She was born weighing 6 pounds, and still does. \u201cHer weight remains the same; it has not increased, not even by one gram,\u201d her mother, 33-year-old Naglaa Waleed Abou Aia, told the NBC News team in Gaza.",
      "Until about two months ago, Waleed Abou Aia said Ramaa \u201cwas nursing naturally, but I am suffering from malnutrition due to a lack of food and water, so the child became malnourished.\u201d",
      "Walking through the ward, Elidalis Burgos, an American critical care nurse volunteering at Nasser Hospital, visited several babies and children. One boy in an orange shirt lay in a cot, his limbs and face bandaged after he was injured from a strike that killed his family. A month later, the angles of his bones were visible under his thin skin.",
      "\u201cHe's suffering from a lot of wounds and severe malnutrition,\u201d Burgos said, \u201cas the blockade has not allowed any nutrition for anybody. Without that, it will be very difficult for a good prognosis.\u201d",
      "Israel says food aid is entering Gaza but is not being distributed by aid groups, but those groups say it\u2019s not enough.",
      "Burgos said that she had witnessed the Israeli military throw away baby formula brought in by the international aid workers, doctors and nurses from her medical nongovernmental agency Glia.",
      "\u201cEven as aid workers, the little bit that we try to bring in, it gets thrown away,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe are not allowed to bring in food or formula for babies or children here.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) denied preventing the entry of infant formula, milk, or nutritional supplements for newborns into the Gaza Strip in a statement to NBC News and said they work to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid. The IDF also claimed that roughly 2,500 tons of infant formula have been transferred into the Gaza Strip since May 19.",
      "The did not respond to Burgos' account that soldiers had thrown away baby formula brought in by aid workers.",
      "It maintains that it has allowed aid into Gaza, blaming the U.N. and Hamas for not ensuring its delivery. U.N. spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric denied that claim on Thursday, blaming Israel for the failure to deliver aid.",
      "Najah Hashem Barbakh, Sela\u2019s mother, said she hadn't eaten anything all day. But, she said, the deadly hunger was edging in to take the most vulnerable first. \u201cI keep telling myself: \u2018I can endure, but my children can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d"

But the question is how much this week\u2019s sudden crisis in Ukraine has nonetheless tarnished the talismanic image of its leader, a man crucial in rallying support at home and abroad for the fight against Russia.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday appeared to reverse his attempt to seize sweeping powers over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Saying he heard the concerns of his people and Western backers, he has now introduced a law that he said would guarantee their independence \u2014 and the agencies themselves said they were satisfied.",

      "At least 16 people have been killed in armed clashes between Thailand and Cambodia, as tensions over a century-old border dispute spiral into the worst fighting between the two Southeast Asian nations in more than a decade.",
      "Since fighting began Thursday, the two sides have been progressively involving heavier weapons, including artillery and rocket systems, with clashes expanding to 12 locations from six. Both blame the other side for starting the conflict, which acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai warned Friday \u201ccould escalate into a state of war.\u201d",
      "At least 14 civilians and one member of the military have been killed, the Thai Health Ministry said Friday, and more than 130,000 residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters. Cambodia reported one civilian death in the border area.",
      "Thailand has accused Cambodia of deliberately targeting civilians, while Cambodia accuses Thailand of using widely prohibited cluster munitions. On Thursday, Thailand, which has a far superior military, used a U.S.-made F-16 fighter jet to carry out an airstrike on a Cambodian military target.",
      "The United States, a longtime treaty ally of Thailand, has called for an \u201cimmediate cessation\u201d of attacks.",
      "\u201cWe are particularly alarmed by reports of harm to innocent civilians,\u201d the State Department said Thursday.",
      "A simmering conflict",
      "The conflict has its roots in the disputed 500-mile border drawn largely by France, Cambodia\u2019s colonial ruler until 1953. Cambodia and Thailand have fought several deadly skirmishes since the border was delineated in 1907, particularly in the area surrounding the ancient 11th-century Hindu temple of Preah Vihear, which both sides claim as their own but was affirmed as Cambodian by the International Court of Justice in 1962 and again in 2013. Thailand rejects the court\u2019s jurisdiction.",
      "The temple\u2019s listing as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008 prompted another flare-up.",
      "Tensions have been building again since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed after both sides opened fire in another contested area where the two meet with Laos, called the Emerald Triangle. Then Wednesday, five Thai soldiers were injured in a land mine explosion along the border, which kicked off the latest clash. Cambodia denies placing land mines.",
      "A series of tit-for-tat moves followed, including both countries expelling each other\u2019s diplomats.",
      "\u201cThe two sides are now at the point of almost no return,\u201d Pou Sothirak, a former Cambodian ambassador to Japan and a distinguished senior adviser to the Cambodian Center for Regional Studies in Phnom Penh, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve locked into this \u2018we\u2019re the victim and you\u2019re the aggressor\u2019 narrative,\u201d he said.",
      "Political fallout",
      "The dispute has set off political turmoil in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended early this month after an extraordinary leak of her phone call with Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia for almost four decades as effectively a one-party state before handing power to his son Hun Manet two years ago.",
      "The father still maintains his grip over Cambodian affairs, which apparently prompted the call by Paetongtarn, 38, whose father, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was known to be close to the 72-year-old Hun Sen. She has said she was trying to defuse the border dispute in the call, during which she referred to Hun Sen as \u201cuncle.\u201d",
      "The conversation, recorded and released by Hun Sen himself, prompted outrage in Thailand, where there was already widespread dissatisfaction with her handling of the border dispute.",
      "Paetongtarn also blasted a Thai army commander during the call, angering an institution that has frequently intervened in the country\u2019s politics, experts said.",
      "\u201cWe have a situation today in which the Thai military is making its own foreign policy against Cambodia. The Thai civilian government has no control over the army at all,\u201d said Paul Wesley Chambers, a visiting fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s free for all and really out of control,\u201d he said of the situation this week, adding that the conflict could topple Phumtham.",
      "Cambodia said it had urged the United Nations Security Council to intervene in Thailand\u2019s \u201cunprovoked and premeditated military aggression.\u201d Thailand says it wants to resolve the conflict bilaterally, but only after Cambodia ceases its attacks.",
      "Neighboring China has offered mediation, but it is seen as closer to the government in Phnom Penh than Bangkok.",
      "Negotiating an end is going to be a challenge for both sides, Pou said, as the Thai military\u2019s effective self-governance has created a diplomatic hole between Thailand and Cambodia, which in the past has undermined the possibility of a permanent end to the border dispute.",
      "\u201cThe Thai military pre-emptively pressures conflicts,\u201d he said."
