      "Barkley last season set an NFL single-season rushing record, postseason included, topping the mark of 2,476 yards set by Terrell Davis. He ended perhaps the greatest debut season of any free agent in Philadelphia sports history with 2,504 yards rushing and 18 rushing touchdowns.",

      "\u201cLilo & Stich\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u2014The Final Reckoning\u201d dominated the box office charts again after fueling a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend. Theaters in the U.S. and Canada had several new films to offer this weekend as well, including Sony\u2019s family friendly \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d and the A24 horror movie \u201cBring Her Back. \u201d According to studio estimates Sunday, it added up to a robust $149 million post-holiday weekend that\u2019s up over 120% from the same timeframe last year.",
      "Disney\u2019s live-action hybrid \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d took first place again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. It was enough to pass \u201cSinners\u201d to become the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Globally, its running total is $610.8 million. \u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, is still going strong in its seventh weekend with another $5.2 million, bumping it to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million globally.",
      "The eighth \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie also repeated in second place, with $27.3 million from 3,861 locations. As with \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d that's down 57% from its opening. With $122.6 million in domestic tickets sold, it\u2019s performing in line with the two previous installments. But with a reported production budget of $400 million, profitability is a ways off. Internationally, it added $76.1 million (including $25.2 million from China where it just opened), bringing its global total to $353.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis is the year of longterm playability,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst. \u201cThe currency of word of mouth and the strong hold is more important than opening weekend dollars.\u201d",
      "Leading the newcomers was Sony\u2019s \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d with an estimated $21 million from 3,809 locations. The movie brings Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio together to train a new kid, the kung fu prodigy Li Fong ( Ben Wang ). Chan starred in a 2010 reboot of the 1984 original, while Macchio has found a new generation of fans in the series \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d which just concluded a six-season run.",
      "Reviews might have been mixed, but opening weekend audiences gave the PG-13 rated film a strong A- CinemaScore and 4.5 stars on PostTrak. It also only cost a reported $45 million to produce and has several weeks until a new family-friendly film arrives. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d opened earlier internationally and has a worldwide total of $47 million.",
      "Fourth place went \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d which earned $10.8 million in its third weekend. The movie is the highest-grossing in the franchise, not accounting for inflation, with $229.3 million globally.",
      "The weekend\u2019s other big newcomer, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d rounded out the top five with $7.1 million from 2,449 screens. Starring Sally Hawkins as a foster mother with some disturbing plans, the film is the sophomore feature of twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou, who made the 2023 horror breakout \u201cTalk to Me.\u201d It earned a rare-for-horror B+ CinemaScore and is essentially the only new film in the genre until \u201c28 Years Later\u201d opens on June 20.",
      "A new Wes Anderson movie, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d also debuted in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, where it made $270,000. It expands nationwide next weekend.",
      "The summer box office forecast remains promising, though there\u2019s a long way to go to get to the $4 billion target (a pre-pandemic norm that only the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer has surpassed). The month of May is expected to close out with $973 million \u2013 up 75% from May 2024, according to data from Comscore.",

      "The appointment of the 45-year-old Venezuelan-Armenian, the husband of soprano Sonya Yoncheva, was announced Friday night. Conlon has been music director since 2006-07 and said in March 2024 that he will retire after after the 2025-26 season.",
      "\u201cLA is a city that is known by innovation, taking risks in productions and musically,\u201d Hindoyan said in New York, where his wife is currently singing at the Metropolitan Opera. \u201cThe idea is to do new pieces, commissions and modern pieces, something to really have a balance between what is classic and go further as much as we can.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan will conduct two productions in 2026-27 and three in each of the following four seasons, LA Opera President Christopher Koelsch said. Koelsch hopes Hindoyan can lead works with Yoncheva, who has not sung a staged production at the LA Opera.",
      "Like other companies, the LA Opera has struggled with increased costs following the pandemic and scrapped a planned pair of world premieres over finances. Tenor and conductor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo was a key figure in fundraising for the company as general director from 2003-19.",
      "\u201cPart of my job as a music director and the job of any musician is to really take care of the art form as much as we can,\" Hindoyan said, \"not only on stage, not only studying at home (but also) the connection with the community and the connection to the donors.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan was born in Caracas, played violin and is a product of El Sistema, the Venezuelan music education system that was instrumental in the careers of Gustavo Dudamel and Rafael Payare. He was an assistant to Daniel Barenboim at Berlin\u2019s Staatsoper unter den Linden.",
      "\u201cGiven Barenboim's extremely exacting standards, I was impressed that he had that job and held onto that job,\" Koelsch said. \u201cAnd then I saw a performance of 'Tosca' and was kind of immediately struck by the elegance of the baton technique and just the sort of the absolute clarity of what he was conveying.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan has been chief conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic since the 2021-22 season. He first conducted the LA Opera last November in Gounod\u2019s \u201cRom\u00e9o et Juliette.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of a natural warmth and charisma to him. In my experience, he almost always coaxes the best out of people,\" Koelsch said. \u201cThe 'Rom\u00e9o' run for me was kind of a test run of how those qualities resonated inside our building, how it worked with the orchestra and the chorus and the administration and the audiences.\u201d",

      "Al Clausen, the Emmy-winning composer who provided the music for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d for 27 years, has died at age 84",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Alf Clausen, the Emmy-winning composer whose music provided essential accompaniment for the animated antics of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d for 27 years, has died.",
      "His daughter Kaarin Clausen told The Associated Press that Alf Clausen died Thursday at his home in Los Angeles after struggling with Parkinson's Disease for about a decade. He was 84.",
      "Clausen, who also scored TV series including \u201cMoonlighting\u201d and \u201cAlf\u201d (\"no relation,\" he used to joke) was nominated for 30 Emmy Awards, 21 of them for \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d winning twice.",
      "Al Jean, an early \u201cSimpsons\u201d writer who was one of the key creative figures on the show in the 1990s, said in a post on X Friday that \u201cClausen was an incredibly talented man who did so much for The Simpsons.\"",
      "While Danny Elfman wrote the show's theme song, Clausen joined the Fox animated series created by Matt Groening in 1990 and provided essentially all of its music until 2017, composing nearly 600 scores and conducting the 35-piece orchestra that played it in the studio.",
      "His colleagues said his music was a key component of the show's comedy, but Clausen believed the best way to back up the gags of Homer, Marge Bart and Lisa was by making the music as straight as possible.",
      "\u201cThis is a dream job for a composer,\u201d Clausen told Variety, which first reported his death, in 1998. \u201cMatt Groening said to me very early on, \u2018We\u2019re not a cartoon. We\u2019re a drama where the characters are drawn. I want you to score it like a drama.\u2019 I score the emotions of the characters as opposed to specific action hits on the screen.\u201d",
      "Groening, in a 1996 interview, called him \u201cone of the unacknowledged treasures of the show.\u201d",
      "Clausen was born in Minneapolis and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota. He graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 1966, and moved to Los Angeles seeking a career in music.",
      "In the 1970s he was a musical director on several TV variety shows including \u201cDonny & Marie.\u201d",
      "Clausen worked as an orchestrator for composer Lee Holdridge in his scores for 1980s films including \u201cSplash\u201d and \u201cThe Beastmaster.\u201d",
      "It was Holdridge who first got the composing job on \u201cMoonlighting,\" the late-80s ABC rom-com detective series starring Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd, but he handed the gig off to Clausen, who would get six Emmy nominations for his music on it.",
      "Clausen won his Emmys for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in 1997 and 1998 and also won five Annie Awards, which honor work in animation in film and television.",
      "He was fired from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in a cost-cutting move in 2017, to the outrage of his collaborators and fans. He sued over his dismissal.",
      "Clausen is survived by his wife Sally, children Kaarin, Scott and Kyle, stepchildren Josh and Emily, and 11 grandchildren.",

      "One day before the kickoff concert for World Pride 2025 in the nation\u2019s capital, headlining performer Shakira has abruptly cancelled due to equipment difficulties",
      "WASHINGTON -- One day before the kickoff concert for World Pride 2025 in the nation's capital, headlining performer Shakira has abruptly cancelled due to equipment difficulties.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that unforeseen circumstances have forced the cancellation\u201d of the concert, the Capital Pride Alliance, the main World Pride organizer, said in a Friday statement. \u201cUpdates about the relocated Opening Ceremony program will be released as soon as they are finalized!\u201d",
      "The multi-platinum singer had been scheduled to headline the opening celebrations Saturday night at Nationals Park. The reasons are apparently an extension of equipment issues related to her Thursday night concert in Boston's Fenway Park, which was also cancelled hours before it was set to begin. A Friday night concert at Fenway for country star Jason Aldean was also cancelled.",
      "\u201cDue to complications with the previous show in Boston, Shakira\u2019s full tour production cannot be transported to Washington, D.C. in time for her scheduled performance at Nationals Park,\u201d the Capital Pride Alliance statement said. \u201cDespite every effort to make it happen, it is not possible to move forward as planned.\u201d",
      "The Alliance noted that the full slate of citywide events was still on for opening weekend, and said the kickoff ceremony would be relocated and reorganized.",
      "The cancellation presents a further challenge for the Alliance, but at least a non-political one. Organizers have already said they expected international attendance to measurably suffer as a result of concern and anger in the LGBTQ+ community over President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Trump\u2019s public antipathy for trans protections and drag shows has already prompted two international LGBTQ+ organizations, Eagle Canada and the African Human Rights Coalition, to issue warnings against traveling to the U.S. at all. The primary concern is that trans or non-binary individuals would face trouble entering the country if passport control officers enforce the administration\u2019s strict binary view of gender status.",
      "Some potential international participants have already announced plans to skip this year\u2019s events, either out of fear of harassment or as a boycott against Trump\u2019s policies. But others have called for a domestic mobilization to flood the capital.",
      "Capital Pride Alliance Executive Director Ryan Bos said that security fencing would be installed surrounding the final two-day concert and rally on a multi-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "Early hotel reservation numbers for the final World Pride weekend, June 6-8, were originally down from the previous year, according to Destination D.C., which tracks reservations.",
      "But Destination D.C. President Elliott Ferguson told reporters on Thursday that, \u201cwhat we\u2019re seeing now is a surge at the last minute, especially with the national community.\u201d",
      "Ferguson speculated that concerns about international attendance had \u201cgalvanized the local community, the national community to want to come to the city.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The nation's public television service, PBS, has filed suit against President Donald Trump's executive order that it be stripped of federal funding",
      "PBS filed suit Friday against President Donald Trump and other administration officials to block his order stripping federal funding from the 330-station public television system, three days after NPR did the same for its radio network.",
      "In its lawsuit, PBS relies on similar arguments, saying Trump was overstepping his authority and engaging in \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d because of his claim that PBS' news coverage is biased against conservatives.",
      "\u201cPBS disputes those charged assertions in the strongest possible terms,\u201d lawyer Z.W. Julius Chen wrote in the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u201cBut regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS's programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.\u201d",
      "It was the latest of many legal actions taken against the administration for its moves, including several by media organizations impacted by Trump's orders.",
      "PBS was joined as a plaintiff by one of its stations, Lakeland PBS, which serves rural areas in northern and central Minnesota. Trump's order is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the station, the lawsuit said.",
      "A PBS spokesman said that \u201cafter careful deliberation, PBS reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television\u2019s editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations.\u201d",
      "Through an executive order earlier this month, Trump told the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to stop funding the two systems. Through the corporation alone, PBS is receiving $325 million this year, most of which goes directly to individual stations.",
      "PBS, which makes much of the programming used by the stations, said it gets 22% of its revenue directly from the feds. Sixty-one percent of PBS' budget is funded through individual station dues, and the stations raise the bulk of that money through the government.",
      "Trump's order \u201cwould have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS member stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans,\u201d Chen wrote.",
      "PBS said the U.S. Department of Education has canceled a $78 million grant to the system for educational programming, used to make children's shows like \u201cSesame Street,\u201d \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog\u201d and \u201cReading Rainbow.\u201d",
      "For Minnesota residents, the order threatens the \u201cLakeland Learns\u201d education program and \u201cLakeland News,\u201d described in the lawsuit as the only television program in the region providing local news, weather and sports.",
      "Besides Trump, the lawsuit names other administration officials as defendants, including Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. PBS says its technology is used as a backup for the nationwide wireless emergency alert system.",
      "The administration has fought with several media organizations. Government-run news services like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are struggling for their lives, The Associated Press has battled with the White House over press access and the Federal Communications Commission is investigating television news divisions.",

      "Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy Awards playing Major Margaret Houlihan on the pioneering hit TV series \u201cM.A.S.H.,\" has died. She was 87.",
      "NEW YORK -- Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy Awards playing Major Margaret Houlihan, the demanding head nurse of a behind-the-lines surgical unit during the Korean War on the pioneering hit TV series \u201cM.A.S.H.,\u201d has died. She was 87.",
      "Publicist Harlan Boll says Swit died Friday at her home in New York City, likely from natural causes.",
      "Swit and Alan Alda were the longest-serving cast members on \u201cM.A.S.H.,\u201d which was based on Robert Altman\u2019s 1970 film, which was itself based on a novel by Richard Hooker, the pseudonym of H. Richard Hornberger.",
      "The CBS show aired for 11 years from 1972 to 1983, revolving around life at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, which gave the show its name. The two-and-a-half-hour finale on Feb. 28, 1983, lured over 100 million viewers, the most-watched episode of any scripted series ever.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine put \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d at No. 25 of the best TV shows of all time, while Time Out put it at No. 34. It won the Impact Award at the 2009 TV Land annual awards. It won a Peabody Award in 1975 \u201cfor the depth of its humor and the manner in which comedy is used to lift the spirit and, as well, to offer a profound statement on the nature of war.\u201d",
      "In Altman\u2019s 1970 film, Houlihan was a one-dimensional character \u2014 a prickly, rules-bound head nurse who was regularly tormented by male colleagues, who gave her the nickname \u201cHot Lips.\u201d Her intimate moments were broadcast to the entire camp after somebody planted a microphone under her bed.",
      "Sally Kellerman played Houlihan in the movie version and Swit took it over for TV, eventually deepening and creating her into a much fuller character. Her sexuality was played down and she wasn\u2019t even called \u201cHot Lips\u201d in the later years.",
      "The growing awareness of feminism in the \u201970s spurred Houlihan\u2019s transformation from caricature to real person, but a lot of the change was due to Swit\u2019s influence on the scriptwriters.",
      "\u201cAround the second or third year I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes,\u201d Swit told Suzy Kalter, author of \u201cThe Complete Book of \u2018M.A.S.H.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cTo oversimplify it, I took each traumatic change that happened in her life and kept it. I didn\u2019t go into the next episode as if it were a different character in a different play. She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.\u201d",
      "\u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d wasn\u2019t an instant hit. It finished its first season in 46th place, out of 75 network TV series, but it nabbed nine Emmy nominations. It was rewarded with a better time slot for its sophomore season, paired on Saturday nights with \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d then TV\u2019s highest-rated show. At the 1974 Emmys, it was crowned best comedy, with Alda winning as best comedy actor.",
      "The series also survived despite cast churn. In addition to Swit and Alda, the first season featured Wayne Rogers, McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville and Gary Burghoff. Harry Morgan, Mike Farrell and David Ogden Stiers would later be added, while Jamie Farr and William Christopher had expanded roles.",
      "\u201cLoretta Swit\u2019s portrayal of Margaret \u2018Hot Lips\u2019 Houlihan was groundbreaking \u2014 bringing heart, humor, and strength to one of television comedy\u2019s most enduring roles. Her talent extended well beyond that iconic character, with acclaimed work on both stage and screen that showcased her intelligence, versatility, and passion,\" National Comedy Center Executive Director Journey Gunderson said in a statement.",
      "Swit appeared in all but 11 episodes of the series, nearly four times longer than the Korean War itself, exploring issues like PTSD, sexism and racism. Swit pushed for a better representation for women.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I liked, with Loretta\u2019s prodding, was every time I had a chance to write for her character, we\u2019d get away from the Hot Lips angle and find out more about who Margaret was. She became more of a real person,\u201d Alda told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018.",
      "The series ended on a happy note for Houlihan, who spends much of the finale debating whether she wants to head to Tokyo or Belgium for her next overseas post. Ultimately she opts to return to America and work at a hospital, citing her father \u2014 a career Army man.",
      "Swit didn\u2019t personally agree that was the correct decision for a military-minded official: \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was correct for my Margaret,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment in 2023. \u201cI think her next move was Vietnam. So I didn\u2019t agree with that, but that\u2019s what they wanted her to do.\u201d",
      "But the actor did get to write the speech that Houlihan delivers to her fellow nurses on their final night together, in which she says: \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor and privilege to have worked with you. And I\u2019m very, very proud to have known you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was consumed with writing that. And I still get letters from women all over the world who became nurses because of Margaret Houlihan. To have contributed to someone\u2019s life like that is remarkable,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment.",
      "During her run, Houlihan had an affair with Hawkeye\u2019s foil, the bumbling Frank Burns, played by Linville in the TV version, and in Season 5, Houlihan returns from a stay in Tokyo engaged to a handsome lieutenant colonel, a storyline that Swit says she advocated for with the writers.",
      "\u201cI told them: \u2018Can you imagine what fun you\u2019re going to have with Larry when I come back to town and I tell him I\u2019m engaged? He\u2019ll rip the doors off of the mess tent!\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what they had him do. So we were all of the same mind.\u201d",
      "Toward the end, Swit was tempted to leave the show. She played the role of Chris Cagney in a 1981 television movie, \u201cCagney & Lacey,\u201d and was offered the part when it was picked up as a midseason series for the spring of 1982. But producers insisted she stay with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d for its last two seasons.",
      "Swit told The Florida Times-Union in 2010 she might have stayed with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d anyway. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but get better as an actor working with scripts like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in something that literate, well, we got spoiled.\u201d",
      "In 2022, James Poniewozik, The New York Times\u2019s chief television critic, looked back on the show and said it held up well: \u201cIts blend of madcap comedy and pitch-dark drama \u2014 the laughs amplifying the serious stakes, and vice versa \u2014 is recognizable in today\u2019s dramedies, from \u2018Better Things\u2019 to \u2018Barry,\u2019 that work in the DMZ between laughter and sadness.\u201d",
      "After the TV series, Swit became a vocal animal welfare activist, selling SwitHeart perfume and her memoir through her official website, with proceeds benefiting various animal-related nonprofit groups.",
      "In 1983, she married actor Dennis Holahan, whom she\u2019d met when he was a guest star on \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d They divorced in 1995.",
      "Born in Passaic, New Jersey, the daughter of Polish immigrants, Swit enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, then paid her dues for years in touring productions.",
      "In 1969, she arrived in Hollywood and was soon seen in series such as \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d \u201cHawaii Five-O,\u201d \u201cMission Impossible\u201d and \u201cBonanza.\u201d Then in 1972, she got her big break when she was asked to audition for the role of \u201cHot Lips.\u201d",
      "She would regularly return to theater, starring on Broadway in 1975 in \u201cSame Time, Next Year\u201d and \u201cThe Mystery of Edwin Drood\u201d in 1986. She was in \u201cAmorous Crossing,\u201d a romantic comedy, at Alhambra Theatre & Dining in 2010 and in North Carolina Theatre\u2019s production of \u201cMame\u201d in 2003.",

      "The lighthouse appeared overnight",
      "MARSEILLE, France -- The lighthouse appeared overnight. Painted on a wall tucked away in a quiet Marseille street, its beam aligned perfectly with the real-life shadow of a metal post on the pavement. At its center, stenciled in crisp white, are the words: \u201cI want to be what you saw in me.\u201d",
      "Banksy had struck again.",
      "On Friday, the elusive British street artist confirmed the work by posting two images on his official Instagram account \u2014 without caption or coordinates. Fans quickly identified the location as 1 Rue F\u00e9lix Fr\u00e9gier, in the Catalans district of Marseille\u2019s 7th arrondissement, near the sea.",
      "Since then, crowds have gathered at the site. Tourists snap photos. Children point. Locals who usually walk past the building stop to take a closer look.",
      "There is no official explanation for the phrase. But its emotional pull is unmistakable \u2014 a quiet plea for recognition, love or redemption. Some speculate it references a country ballad by Lonestar. Others call it a love letter. Or a lament. Or both.",
      "The image is deceptively simple: a lone lighthouse, dark and weathered, casting a stark white beam. But what gives it power is the way it plays with light \u2014 the real and the painted, the seen and the imagined. The post in front of the wall becomes part of the piece. Reality becomes the frame.",
      "Marseille\u2019s mayor, Beno\u00eet Payan, was quick to react online. \u201cMarseille x Banksy,\u201d he wrote, adding a flame emoji. By midday, the hashtag #BanksyMarseille was trending across France, and beyond.",
      "Though often political, Banksy\u2019s art is just as often personal, exploring themes of loss, longing and identity. In recent years, his works have appeared on war-ravaged buildings in Ukraine, in support of migrants crossing the Mediterranean and on walls condemning capitalism, Brexit, and police brutality.",
      "The artist, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world\u2019s best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \u201cLaugh now, but one day I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d",
      "His work has sold for millions of dollars at auction, and past murals on outdoor sites have often been stolen or removed by building owners soon after going up. In December 2023, after Banksy stenciled military drones on a stop sign in south London, a man was photographed taking down the sign with bolt cutters. Police later arrested two men on suspicion of theft and criminal damage.",
      "In March 2024, an environmentally themed work on a wall beside a tree in north London was splashed with paint, covered with plastic sheeting and fenced off within days of being created.",
      "Despite the fame \u2014 or infamy \u2014 at least in Marseille, not everyone walking past noticed it. Some didn\u2019t even know who Banksy was, according to the local press.",
      "On Instagram observers say this Marseille piece feels quieter. More interior.",
      "And yet, it is no less global. The work arrives just ahead of a major Banksy retrospective opening June 14 at the Museum of Art in nearby Toulon featuring 80 works, including rare originals. Another exhibit opens Saturday in Montpellier.",
      "But the Marseille mural wasn\u2019t meant for a museum. It lives in the street, exposed to weather, footsteps and time. As of Friday evening, no barriers had been erected. No glass shield installed. Just a shadow, a beam and a message that\u2019s already circling the world.",

      "The Imperial Household Agency said both the mother and child are in good health, but did not disclose the baby's date of birth or gender.",
      "The former princess, 33, is a niece of Emperor Naruhito. She married a former college classmate Kei Komuro, a commoner, and renounced her royal status in 2021 as required by Japan's Imperial House Law. Days after their marriage, the couple moved to New York where her husband works as a lawyer.",

      "LONDON -- Actor and comedian Russell Brand pleaded not guilty in a London court Friday to rape and sexual assault charges involving four women dating back more than 25 years.",
      "Brand, who turns 50 next week, denied two counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault. He said \"not guilty\u201d after each charge was read in Southwark Crown Court.",
      "His trial was scheduled for June 3, 2026 and is expected to last four to five weeks.",
      "Prosecutors said that the offenses took place between 1999 and 2005 \u2014 one in the English seaside town of Bournemouth and the other three in London.",
      "Brand didn't speak to reporters as he arrived at court wearing dark sunglasses, a suit jacket, a black collared shirt open below his chest and black jeans. In his right hand, he clutched a copy of the \u201cThe Valley of Vision,\u201d a collection of Puritan prayers.",
      "The \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor known for risqu\u00e9 stand-up routines, battles with drugs and alcohol, has dropped out of the mainstream media in recent years and built a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories, as well as discussing religion.",
      "On a five-minute prayer video he posted Monday on social media, Brand wrote: \u201cJesus, thank you for saving my life.\u201d",
      "When the charges were announced last month, he said that he welcomed the opportunity to prove his innocence.",
      "\u201cI was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord,\u201d he said in a social media video. \u201cI was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile. But what I never was was a rapist. I\u2019ve never engaged in nonconsensual activity. I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.\u201d",
      "Brand is accused of raping a woman at a hotel room in Bournemouth when she attended a 1999 Labour Party conference and met him at an event where he was performing.

      "Big Ocean, the world\u2019s first K-pop group composed entirely of deaf and hard-of-hearing artists, is breaking barriers with high-tech tools and inclusive performances",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Big Ocean, a three-member K-pop group composed entirely of artists with hearing disabilities, is redefining the limits of music and performance \u2014 one beat at a time.",
      "When Big Ocean takes the stage, they seamlessly incorporate sign language into their performances. But their polished shows are built on extensive preparation using high-tech tools born from necessity \u2014 vibrating smartwatches that pulse with musical beats and LED visual metronomes that flash timing cues during practice sessions. This technological approach represents significant progress in South Korea\u2019s entertainment industry, where career opportunities for people with disabilities have historically been limited.",
      "The trio, PJ, Jiseok and Chanyeon, made their debut in April 2024 and recently wrapped a solo European tour marking their first anniversary. The band performed in four countries, including France and the U.K., while promoting their second mini-album, \u201cUnderwater,\u201d which dropped on April 20.",
      "PJ rose to prominence as a YouTuber who educated viewers about hearing disabilities. Chanyeon previously worked as an audiologist. Jiseok was a professional ski racer.",
      "To achieve the precision crucial in K-pop\u2019s demanding choreography and music, Big Ocean relies on technologies rarely seen in the genre. Members wear modified vibrating smartwatches that deliver rhythmic cues to their wrists and practice with visual metronomes \u2014 flashing light guides displayed on monitors \u2014 to help stay in sync when audio alone isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Chanyeon uses a hybrid hearing device with Bluetooth that streams music directly from mobile devices. The group also uses a pitch-checking app and AI voice conversion technology to support vocal training and enhance audio output after recordings.",
      "\u201cWe each felt rhythm differently when dancing,\u201d PJ told The Associated Press. \u201cSo when we\u2019d play the same song and dance in front of the mirror, one of us would move faster while another would move slower. To solve this timing issue, we decided to memorize everything together and create our own cues with each other.\u201d",
      "This precision becomes critical during live performances, where unexpected disruptions can derail even experienced performers. \u201cWhen we performed in France, our fans were cheering so loudly we lost the beat,\u201d said Jiseok. \u201cBut we looked at each other and quickly handled the situation \u2014 just like we practiced.\u201d",
      "Stage effects and certain musical styles create additional obstacles. \u201cWhen a lot of smoke comes up, sometimes we momentarily can\u2019t see the stage movements in front of us,\u201d PJ said. \u201cOur concentration gets disrupted instantly in those moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s no clear beat in a song, it\u2019s really hard for us to stay synchronized,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen the bass is overwhelming, it\u2019s difficult for us to catch it accurately.\u201d",
      "Despite these challenges, Big Ocean\u2019s commitment to accessibility and inclusion has inspired their global fanbase. Big Ocean\u2019s global fanbase \u2014 known as PADO \u2014 has responded with similar commitment.",
      "\u201cWhile communicating with PADO, we\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re actually learning Korean sign language for us, or learning various sign languages to communicate with us,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen we see how much they\u2019re preparing and putting in that effort, we feel so grateful.\u201d",
      "The group uses English for basic communication with international fans and incorporates Korean Sign Language, American Sign Language and International Sign to promote accessibility and inclusion.",
      "Jiseok credits BTS\u2019s RM with inspiring his musical journey. He said RM\u2019s donation to his former school \u2014 a private institution for deaf and hard of hearing students \u2014 gave him access to music and dance for the first time. \u201cWithout those learning opportunities, I probably never would have dreamed of becoming a K-pop idol,\u201d he said.",
      "Looking ahead, Big Ocean hopes to build on its growing global profile.",
      "\u201cWe recently saw Justin Bieber\u2019s Instagram post asking for music collaborators, so we sent him a DM,\u201d PJ said. \u201cAll of us would love the opportunity to work with him. And personally, I\u2019d also love to work with Billie Eilish.\u201d",
      "As the band reflects on its first year, Chanyeon said their biggest growth has been internal.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always liked playing it safe \u2014 even with food, I only ate what I was used to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut through Big Ocean, I\u2019ve gained confidence in trying new things. That\u2019s what I\u2019m most satisfied with.\u201d",

      "A New Zealand flag printed with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d and displayed on the floor of an art gallery in the city of Nelson has been removed from display after protests, the gallery said Thursday",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand flag printed with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d and laid on the floor of an art gallery has once again been packed away following public outcry, 30 years after protests forced the removal of the same artwork.",
      "The Suter Art Gallery in the city of Nelson said Thursday it had taken down the work by M\u0101ori artist Diane Prince due to escalating tensions and safety fears. The episode mirrored an Auckland gallery's removal of the work amid public backlash and complaints to law enforcement in 1995.",
      "This time, the flag was meant to remain on display for five months. Instead, it lasted just 19 days, reigniting long-running debates in New Zealand over artistic expression, national symbols and the country\u2019s colonial history.",
      "Police told The Associated Press on Friday that officers were investigating \u201cseveral\u201d complaints about the exhibition.",
      "The piece, titled Flagging the Future, is a cloth New Zealand flag displayed on the floor with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d stenciled across it. The flag features the British Union Jack and red stars on a blue background.",
      "The work was part of an exhibition, Diane Prince: Activist Artist, and was meant to provoke reflection on the M\u0101ori experience since New Zealand's colonization by Britain in the 19th century. Prince created the piece in 1995 in response to a government policy that limited compensation to M\u0101ori tribes for historical land theft.",
      "\u201cI have no attachment to the New Zealand flag,\u201d Prince told Radio New Zealand in 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t call myself a New Zealander. I call myself a M\u0101ori.\u201d",
      "Prince couldn\u2019t be reached immediately for comment Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s reckoning with its colonial past has gathered pace in recent decades. But there has been little appetite among successive governments to sever the country\u2019s remaining constitutional ties to Britain or change the flag to a design that doesn't feature the Union Jack.",
      "New Zealand is among countries where desecrating the national flag is considered taboo and prohibited by law. Damaging a flag in public with intent to dishonor it is punishable by a fine of up to 5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,984), but prosecutions are fleetingly rare.",
      "As in the United States and elsewhere, the country\u2019s flag is synonymous for some with military service. But for others, particularly some M\u0101ori, it\u2019s a reminder of land dispossession, and loss of culture and identity.",
      "Protests of the artwork in the city of Nelson, population 55,000, included videos posted to social media by a local woman, Ruth Tipu, whose grandfather served in the army\u2019s M\u0101ori Battalion during World War II. In one clip, she is seen lifting the flag from the floor and draping it over another artwork, an action Tipu said she would repeat daily.",
      "A veterans\u2019 group also denounced the piece as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d City council member Tim Skinner said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the work\u2019s inclusion.",
      "But others welcomed it. Nelson\u2019s deputy mayor, Rohan O\u2019Neill-Stevens, posted on social media \u201cin strong defense of artistic expression and the right for us all to be challenged and confronted by art.\u201d",
      "The work was perhaps expected to provoke controversy and in the exhibition\u2019s opening days, The Suter Gallery defended its inclusion. But a statement on its Facebook page late Thursday said a \u201csharp escalation in the tone and nature of the discourse, moving well beyond the bounds of respectful debate\u201d had prompted the flag\u2019s removal.",
      "\u201cThis should not be interpreted as a judgement on the artwork or the artist\u2019s intent,\u201d the statement said. The gallery didn\u2019t detail specific incidents of concern and a gallery spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for an interview on Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s Police said in a statement Friday that while officers were investigating complaints, they weren\u2019t called to any disturbances at the exhibition. Prince said when she revived the work in 2024 that threats of prosecution by law enforcement had prompted its removal from the Auckland gallery in 1995.",
      "The Nelson gallery didn't suggest in its statement that police involvement had influenced Thursday's decision.",

      "As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it",
      "NEW YORK -- As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it.",
      "We should all be so alive and so remembered at his age. Fogerty, in the midst of an international tour, played a rowdy 100-minute set Thursday night to an adoring, near-capacity audience at Manhattan's Beacon Theatre. Crowd members spanned from those likely to remember \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cFortunate Son\u201d and other Creedence Clearwater Revival hits when first released a half-century ago to those looking young enough to have heard about them through their grandparents.",
      "At least from a distance, Fogerty didn't look or sound much different from his prime with Creedence, which was rarely off the charts between 1969 and 1971. He wore his trademark flannel shirt; had the same shaggy haircut, although with his bangs brushed back; sang with a vintage roar that has mellowed only slightly; and even played the same guitar, a Rickenbacker, that he had acquired back in the late '60s.",
      "Fogerty presented himself as a proud rock \u2018n' roller, and a very proud family man. His band includes two of his sons on guitar, Shane and Tyler, with daughter Kelsy briefly joining them on a third guitar. Off to the side was his wife, Julie, whom he praised as the love and the hero of his life, if only because she gave one of the greatest gifts an old rock star could ask for: She helped win back rights to his song catalogue. Fogerty had battled over his copyrights for decades, and at one point found himself being sued for plagiarizing one of his Creedence hits, which at the time he didn\u2019t own.",
      "He has marked his victory with an upcoming album, \u201cLegacy,\u201d for which he recorded new versions of 20 songs. If you were in the house Thursday night, you couldn't help hearing about it. A promotional film about \u201cLegacy\u201d opened the show and Fogerty mentioned it again before his encore set. Both the album, subtitled \u201cThe Creedence Clearwater Revival Years,\u201d and his concert tell a story of how he wants to look back.",
      "As Fogerty noted at one point Thursday night, Creedence Clearwater Revival soared to the highest heights before imploding bitterly in the early \u201870s and never again recording or touring together. Only Creedence diehards would have known the identity of the other band members \u2014 drummer Doug Clifford, bassist Stu Cook, and guitarist Tom Fogerty, John\u2019s brother, who died in 1990. Their names were never mentioned, their faces near-invisible among the rush of images that appeared Thursday on a screen behind Fogerty and his band. The new tracks on \u201cLegacy,\u201d each labeled \u201cJohn's Version,\u201d leave only John Fogerty from the original group.",
      "The Beacon show was very much about where is he now, and how much he likes it. He dashed about the stage, rocked out on his Rickenbacker with the joy of a teenager on air guitar and even poured himself champagne. Fans clapped and danced, while being showered with confetti and dazzled with lasers and fog. The more informed sang along with \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain\u201d and the baseball anthem \u201cCenterfield,\" Fogerty's most famous post-Creedence song. Virtually all stood and cheered to serenade the night\u2019s guest of honor, whose birthday was the day before.",

      "Trump's status as a \u201ccontent creator\u201d was also damaged by attention given to the interview, lawyers said. It was part of their argument opposing CBS parent Paramount Global's effort to dismiss the president's $20 billion lawsuit against the company, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. Trump has claimed the editing was done to advantage Harris, which CBS rejects.",
      "Even with the effort to dismiss the case, Paramount is engaged in settlement discussions with Trump. The prospect of a settlement has so rattled CBS News that two of its top executives have resigned in protest.",
      "Trump, who did not agree to be interviewed by \u201c60 Minutes\" during the campaign, has protested editing where Harris is seen giving two different answers to a question by the show's Bill Whitaker in separate clips aired on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cFace the Nation\u201d earlier in the day. CBS said each reply came within Harris' long-winded answer to Whitaker, but was edited to be more succinct.",
      "Trump's lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, said that \u201cthis led to widespread confusion and mental anguish of consumers, including plaintiffs, regarding a household name of the legacy media apparently deceptively distorting its broadcasts, and then resisting attempts to clear the public record.\u201d",
      "Because they were misled, voters withheld attention from Trump and his Truth Social platform, Paltzik argued.",
      "Trump, described as a \u201cmedia icon\u201d by his lawyers, was \u201cforced to redirect significant time, money and effort to correcting the public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Paramount and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone are seeking the settlement with Trump, whose administration must approve the company's proposed merger with Skydance Media. CBS News' president and CEO, Wendy McMahon, and \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens, who both opposed a settlement, have resigned in recent weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a media advocacy group that says it is a Paramount shareholder, said that it would file a lawsuit in protest if a settlement is reached.",

Ron Wyden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said they are investigating whether a settlement would violate bribery laws.",

      "The genre they played \u2013 Mexican regional music, which encapsulates a wide range of styles including corridos and cumbia \u2013 has in recent years gained a spotlight as it's entered a sort of international musical renaissance. Young artists have mixed the classic genre with trap and sometimes pay homage to leaders of drug cartels, often portrayed as Robin Hood-type figures.",
      "While it was not immediately clear if the group played such songs, other artists have faced death threats by cartels, while others have had their visas stripped by the United States under accusations by the Trump administration that they were glorifying criminal violence.",
      "Few details were released about where the bodies were found and in what conditions, but Tamaulipas state prosecutors had been investigating the case, according to a statement by state security officials. The last time they had communicated with their families was Sunday night, when they said they were going to a venue where they were hired to play.",
      "After that, nothing else was heard of them. Officials said the bodies shared characteristics of artists, though did not provide further detail.",
      "Their disappearance caused an uproar in Tamaulipas, a state long eclipsed by cartel warfare. Their families reported the disappearances, called on the public for support and people took to the streets in protest.",
      "On Wednesday, protesters blocked the international bridge connecting Reynosa and Pharr, Texas, later going to a local cathedral to pray and make offerings to the disappeared.",
      "As of midday Thursday, the state prosecutor\u2019s office had not released further details on the case.",
      "Reynosa is a Mexican border city adjacent to the United States and has been plagued by escalating violence since 2017 due to internal disputes among groups vying for control of drug trafficking, human smuggling and fuel theft.",
      "This case follows another that occurred in 2018, when armed men kidnapped two members of the musical group \u201cLos Norte\u00f1os de R\u00edo Bravo,\u201d whose bodies were later found on the federal highway connecting Reynosa to R\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas.",

      "A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge declared Thursday that a man is mentally incompetent to stand trial on charges of stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through her front gate.",
      "The move in a Los Angeles County mental health court came after a second psychiatrist examined the defendant, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, and reached the same conclusion as the first: that his mental health would not allow him to answer to felony charges of vandalism and stalking of the \u201cFriends\u201d star.",
      "\u201cThe court finds the defendant is not currently competent to stand trial,\u201d Judge Maria Cavalluzzi said. \u201cCriminal proceedings will remain suspended.\u201d",
      "Carwyle, 48, of Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty. He appeared behind glass in a custody area of the courtroom and did not speak. He looked vastly different than his previous two court hearings. His scraggly gray hair and beard had been shorn, and he was wearing bright yellow county jail clothing after previously appearing with bare shoulders, wrapped in a blanket-like smock meant for suicide prevention.",
      "Carwyle had argued that he is competent, and exercised his right to a second opinion after an initial incompetence finding last week.",
      "\u201cIt's not the outcome my client would have preferred,\" Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge.",
      "A conviction on the charges, along with an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm, could bring up to three years in prison for Carwyle. The incompetence finding has no set end date but it is temporary, and the standard criminal process could resume later.",
      "Cavalluzzi ordered more comprehensive mental evaluations to help determine where and how he'll be held, and what his treatment will be. The judge will get a report on the results at a June 26 hearing, where Aniston or her attorney will be allowed to share her perspective on the case.",
      "Aniston's lawyer, Blair Berk, was in the courtroom observing Thursday, but did not speak. Berk and the deputy district attorney handling the case declined comment outside court.",
      "Prosecutors allege Carwyle had been harassing Aniston with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, causing major damage. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. Authorities said Aniston was home at the time, but did not come into contact, and no one was injured.",
      "Aniston became one of television's biggest stars in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends,\u201d from 1994 until 2004. She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

      "\u201cI won\u2019t sugar-coat it: it\u2019s rough. But I\u2019m hopeful. I\u2019m being lovingly cared for by friends and family, my medical team is brilliant, and I\u2019ve never felt more held by the people around me,\u201d she added.",
      "Szubanski said that she had shaved her head before appearing in a video \u201cin anticipation of it all falling out in a couple of weeks.\u201d That was an apparent reference to undergoing chemotherapy.",

      "It didn't occur to Ben Wang right away that in taking on \u201c Karate Kid: Legends,\u201d he'd be the franchise's first Asian American \u201cKid.\u201d And that gives him a lot of optimism.",
      "\u201cAt first I didn't even think about that,\u201d Wang told The Associated Press. \u201cThat feels like a very cool and actually privileged position that I get to be in.\"",
      "His casting happened, he said, in \"a world where that's normal enough.\"",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d which opens Friday, unites OG Ralph Macchio's Daniel and Jackie Chan's Mr. Han from the 2010 movie to help Wang's Li Fong win a New York City karate competition.",
      "In the original \u201cKarate Kid\u201d movie, which came out more than 40 years ago, Pat Morita was the only main Asian American cast member even though it takes place in California's San Fernando Valley. His beloved Mr. Miyagi helped underdog Daniel wax on and wax off against white karate bullies. That arc has been replicated and flipped in sequels and offshoots ever since. The overall lack of Asian and Asian American representation all these years has been a lingering point of contention for some.",
      "Jeff Yang, author of \u201cThe Golden Screen: The Movies That Made Asian America,\u201d said he knows plenty of Asian Americans who find most of the Miyagi-verse entertaining. At the same time, even the recent Netflix \u201cCobra Kai\u201d series hardly had any young Asian American main characters. That lost opportunity felt like a \u201cloose, nagging tooth,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a situation where the ancient or legendary martial arts master is transferring his skills not just to another generation, but into another community,\u201d Jeff Yang said. \u201cIn a way, that feels like for me as an Asian American, it turns it into a guilty pleasure.\"",
      "The Asians who were there were \u201ceither sidekicks or villains,\" he added.",
      "In Asia, there's a long cinematic history of elite martial artists-turned-actors ranging from icon Bruce Lee to Chan and Jet Li. But in Hollywood, Asian characters who did perform karate or kung-fu often weren't written three-dimensionally. Most of the stars who could shine for acting and on-screen fighting weren't Asian.",
      "\u201cIn a way that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Yang said. \u201cMartial arts is one of the things that was brought to the United States by soldiers who had been stationed in Asia, learned the practice, embraced the lifestyle and the discipline.\u201d",
      "By the 1970s and '80s, karate dojos were becoming popular all over the U.S. in cities and suburbs. So \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d debuted at just the right time.",
      "Ken Nagayama, a martial arts grand master who runs a school in the Valley, was an instructor at a North Hollywood dojo used for scenes in the original film. He recalls meeting Pat Morita. But, he wasn't thinking about casting. He was impressed by how much interest in karate shot up because of one movie.",
      "\u201cWhen that came out, so many people were interested in taking class, especially younger kids,\u201d said Nagayama, who plans to watch \u201cLegends\u201d with some of his students. He had \u201ca whole mix\u201d of students of all races signing up.",
      "Steven Ho, a stunt coordinator and martial artist who lives in Los Angeles and has appeared multiple times on Conan O'Brien's talk shows, remembers Morita, Macchio and William Zabka watching tournaments he competed in to prepare for the first movie. He was such a fan of Morita that he never thought about how there were no other Asian actors.",
      "\u201cPat Morita, to me, he was the lead,\u201d Ho said. \u201cAlso, if that were the only martial arts film out there, then yeah, it would be odd and I would be disappointed. But you gotta remember the \u201880s and \u201990s we were living in the golden age of Jet Li, Jackie Chan, films that featured ... more authentic martial artists.\"",
      "It's a full-circle moment that Chan is one of the mentors in this new flick. Wang is still in disbelief he got to do combat choreography with the superstar.",
      "\u201cHe's the guy you think he is,\u201d Wang said with a grin. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t turn it off when he\u2019s not on set.\u201d",
      "Ho happily points out that \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is reinforcing how his 12-year-old twin sons are growing up without negative Asian stereotypes like he did. He\u2019d rather a story have no Asians if the characters are going to be the butt of the joke. That history of stereotyping of Asian men is why he initially declined appearing on O\u2019Brien\u2019s show.",
      "\u201cI thought \u201dOh, he\u2019s a tall guy. I\u2019m a short, Asian guy. They\u2019re just going to goof on me. They\u2019re going to go off on me,' so I said, \u2018You know, I\u2019m gonna be out of town,\u2019\u201d Ho said.",
      "Luckily, the segments, which have earned millions of YouTube views, were crafted so Ho was the straight-man to O\u2019Brien\u2019s buffoonery.",
      "Twins Jonny and Ollie, in fact, are real-life karate kids. The boys, known as the \u201cTwinjas,\" know karate, mixed martial arts and other disciplines. They count Bruce Lee's daughter, Shannon, as a friend. They've appeared on \u201cAmerica's Got Talent,\u201d \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\" and taught Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg moves. They love \u201cCobra Kai\u201d for the drama and want to see \u201cLegends\u201d for Chan. They have since been introduced to the movie that started it all.",
      "For Ollie, Miyagi was his favorite character.",
      "\u201cI think that in the first Karate Kids, how the teacher was Asian, I think being a teacher is better than being a student,\u201d he said.",
      "Jonny says not every show or movie in this genre has to have an Asian lead, but when there is one, he takes note.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s definitely a lot of other movies and shows that have Asian leads, like Simu Liu, the first Asian superhero,\u201d Jonny said, referring to Marvel's \u201c Shang-Chi.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very significant.\"",
      "The Twinjas, who are working on a children's fiction book that's part mystery and part action, are not shy about voicing their own desire for \u201cany opportunities that come our way, we\u2019d love to take, especially for acting and using our martial arts skills,\u201d Ollie said.",
      "Perhaps they'll get some inspiration from seeing Wang in \u201cLegends.\u201d Wang considers it a \"point of pride\u201d if young Asian American children view him as a benchmark so they can see themselves as the hero.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep going back to is it's a privilege,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWhat I love about this series is ... there's this idea anyone can be the \u2018Karate Kid.\u2019\u201d",

      "A law firm says the number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000",
      "The number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000, a British law firm said on Monday.",
      "Rylands Garth, based in London, said more than 520 ex-players from rugby union and rugby league joined the lawsuit by Friday last week, which was the deadline for new applicants set by a court ahead of a hearing in July and before the case potentially goes to trial next year.",
      "It takes the total number of players who are part of the lawsuit to approximately 1,100, Rylands Garth said in a statement.",
      "The former players contend, according to Rylands Garth, that \u201crugby governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect them from the impacts of concussive and sub-concussive blows during their playing careers, despite knowing of the risks.\u201d",
      "Claimants are seeking compensation from World Rugby, the English Rugby Football Union and Welsh Rugby Union \u2014 governing bodies in 15-a-side rugby \u2014 and the English Rugby Football League and British Amateur Rugby League Association \u2014 from 13-a-side rugby league \u2014 for lost earnings, medical bills and care costs associated with their injuries, the firm said.",
      "\u201cRylands Garth is also calling for urgent and substantive reform of the game to better protect the safety of current and future players \u2014 including the creation of an independent brain health ombudsman for the sport,\u201d it said.",
      "Among those to have previously joined the class action was World Cup-winning former England hooker Steve Thompson, former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman and former Wales flanker Alix Popham.",
      "\u201cThis surge in claimants exposes the deep-rooted issues in rugby,\u201d Rylands Garth said, adding: \"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement issued by World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU, the governing bodies said they \u201care aware of the latest update shared by the claimants\u2019 legal representatives with the final number of claimants.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe now await full details of their diagnosis and the claims being made. Our thoughts are with any former player facing challenges.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.",
      "The 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.",
      "Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.",
      "Kennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d",
      "His comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.",
      "Some worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.",
      "Ohio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who's 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d",
      "While announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.",
      "For Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.",
      "Daniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.",
      "\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d",
      "The Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.",
      "\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d",
      "Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.",
      "Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.",
      "At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.",
      "Lamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.",
      "\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d",
      "Copeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.",
      "Ashley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.",
      "\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d",
      "Doctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.",
      "Kennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.",
      "Both he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.",

Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "A ban on disposable vapes has come into force across the U.K. as the British government aims to stem their illegal use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment",
      "LONDON -- A ban on disposable vapes came into force across the U.K. on Sunday as the British government aims to stem their use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment.",
      "The ban makes it illegal for any retailer \u2014 online or in-store \u2014 to sell vapes, whether they contain nicotine or not. They will still be able to sell reusable vapes.",
      "The crackdown follows the soaring use of disposable vapes in schools and a rising tide of trash as users dispose of the vapes. It is estimated that as many as 5 million disposable vapes are thrown in bins or littered every week across the U.K., rather than being recycled.",
      "A number of countries are seeking to regulate the vape market, which has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Australia outlawed the sale of vapes outside pharmacies last year in some of the world\u2019s toughest restrictions on electronic cigarettes, while Belgium became the first European Country to ban the use of disposable vapes at the start of this year. California has been at the forefront of bringing in new regulations in the U.S.",
      "The U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said usage among young people remained too high, and the ban would \u201cput an end to their alarming rise in school playgrounds and the avalanche of rubbish flooding the nation\u2019s streets.\u201d",
      "Also known as single-use vapes, disposable vapes are non-refillable and unable to be recharged, and are typically thrown away with general waste or just thrown on the street. Even when they are recycled, they need to be taken apart by hand, while their batteries are a fire risk to recycling facilities and can leak harmful chemicals into the environment and potentially harming wildlife.",
      "Businesses were given six months to prepare for the change by selling any existing stock. Rogue traders who continue to sell them risk a fine of 200 ($260) in the first instance, followed by an unlimited fine or jail time for repeat offending.",
      "The U.K. Vaping Industry Association said its members had moved quickly to comply with the June 1 deadline, but warned of \u201cserious unintended consequences\u201d emanating from too much regulation.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that this ban will encourage former smokers who have already transitioned from cigarettes, which kill 220 people every day in the U.K, to return to combustible tobacco or opt for unregulated vapes,\" said its director general, John Dunne.",
      "Separately, the British government is legislating to potentially restrict the packaging, marketing and flavors of e-cigarettes.",

      "ROME -- French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, best known as the inventor of the abortion pill, died on Friday aged 98 at his home in Paris, his institute said in a statement.",
      "Both a doctor and a researcher, Baulieu was known around the world for the scientific, medical and social significance of his work on steroid hormones.",
      "\u201cHis research was guided by his attachment to the progress made possible by science, his commitment to women\u2019s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,\u201d the Institut Baulieu said in the statement posted on its website.",
      "Born Etienne Blum in Strasbourg on Dec. 12, 1926, he took the name \u201c\u00c9mile Baulieu\u201d when he joined the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation at the age of 15.",
      "An endocrinologist with a doctorate in medicine completed in 1955 and one in science eight years later, in 1963 Baulieu founded a pioneering research unit working on hormones at INSERM, the French institute for health and medical research. He remained as head of the unit until 1997.",
      "He is best known for his development, in 1982, of RU 486, the so-called \u201cabortion pill\u201d that changed the lives of millions of women throughout the world, offering them the possibility of voluntary medical termination of pregnancy, in physical and psychological safety.",
      "The Institut Baulieu said it was \u201ca non-invasive method, less aggressive and less delayed than surgery,\u201d noting that following his discovery the researcher faced fierce criticism and even threats from opponents of women's abortion rights.",
      "\u201cEven today, access to this method is opposed, banned in some countries, and is currently being challenged in the United States, where it is the most widely used abortion method,\u201d the institute added.",
      "Baulieu\u2019s research into DHEA, a hormone whose secretion and anti-aging activity he had discovered, led him to work on neurosteroids -- or steroids of the nervous system. He also developed an original treatment to combat depression, for which a clinical trial is currently underway in several university hospitals.",
      "In 2008, he founded the Institut Baulieu to understand, prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.",
      "Honored with the grand crosses of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur (legion of honor) and the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (national order of merit), he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1982, which he chaired in 2003 and 2004.",
      "He was a member of the national advisory committee on life sciences and health (1996-2002) and received numerous awards, both in France and abroad.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Baulieu in a post on X, calling him \u201ca beacon of courage\u201d and \u201ca progressive mind who enabled women to win their freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cFew French people have changed the world to such an extent,\u201d he added.",
      "After the death of his first wife, Yolande Compagnon, he remarried, to Simone Harari Baulieu. He is survived by three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, his institute said.",

      "The attorneys filed a motion Friday to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit, but did not give a reason for seeking to drop the case. The lawsuit had been filed last year in state court in Louisville on behalf of a woman who was seven weeks pregnant at the time and identified only by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy.",

      "\u201cPeople have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,\u201d said Amber Duke, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cWe are strategizing our next steps in this fight.\u201d",

      "Americans are losing an array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee.",
      "State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big \u2014 and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities \u2014 are being hollowed out.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed.",
      "Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.",
      "The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That's one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.",
      "\"It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d",
      "Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.",
      "Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.",
      "\u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said.",
      "The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated.",
      "The Mecklenburg County department, with \"Protecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.",
      "\u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d",
      "What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.",
      "Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d",
      "State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.",
      "Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department's budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.",
      "At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening.",
      "\u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.",
      "A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.",
      "The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.",
      "A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d",
      "HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.",
      "In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.",
      "In Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.",
      "The cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d",
      "CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.",
      "So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.",
      "She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines.",
      "\u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.",
      "With health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California\u2019s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.",
      "But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation \u2014 some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County\u2019s health director. \u201cWhat really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. ...

      "The nation\u2019s top public health agency has posted new recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women may \u2014 but no longer should \u2014 get COVID-19 vaccinations",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get COVID-19 vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.",
      "The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "But the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt's not as bad as it could have been.\"",
      "Kennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.",
      "A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.",
      "\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\"",
      "That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.",
      "Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "A CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.",
      "But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.",
      "The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \"incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.",

      "Carlos Alcaraz has been wearing nasal strips in some matches since last season",
      "PARIS -- If more tennis players find themselves breathing easier, it might just be thanks to Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "The four-time Grand Slam champion, whose bid for a second consecutive French Open title was scheduled to continue with a third-round match Friday night, has often worn a nasal strip in matches since last season \u2014 although not during his first two contests at Roland-Garros this week \u2014 and the sport's other athletes took note.",
      "After all, if Alcaraz finds something useful on the court, their thinking goes, maybe it makes sense to give the adhesive bands a shot.",
      "\u201cI saw Carlos playing in it,\u201d said 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, a semifinalist in Paris last year and the No. 6 women's seed this time. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty interested to try and see if there is really a difference. If he plays matches in it, then probably there is.\u201d",
      "At the 2024 season-ending ATP Finals last November, Alcaraz said: \u201cIt is something that I\u2019m going to wear more often. I could recover better between points.\u201d",
      "Once associated with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, the bands, which essentially look like a Band-Aid worn across the bridge of the nose, are popping up on tennis courts \u2014 sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of curiosity.",
      "They are designed to open the nostrils slightly, making it easier to breathe through the nose. Originally marketed to reduce snoring, they\u2019re being embraced to enhance air intake during physical exertion.",
      "The idea is simple: Better breathing could mean better oxygen intake.",
      "In practice, the science is less convincing.",
      "In 2021, Brazilian academic Ricardo Dinardi reviewed more than 600 studies on nasal strips and found they didn\u2019t make a real difference in how much air athletes took in, their heart rate or how strenuous exercise felt.",
      "\u201cThe effect on athletic performance is mostly placebo,\u201d Dinardi said. \u201cBut in elite sports, even perceived benefits can count.\u201d",
      "Three-time major finalist Casper Ruud, who wore the strips in matches earlier this year, knows the evidence is shaky. But he still liked using them \u2014 both on the court and while sleeping. Like Alcaraz, Ruud did not wear one in Paris before his second-round exit.",
      "But he has been testing a prototype of a different version.",
      "\u201cI tried out a device that\u2019s very early in development. It will be a bit more comfortable to wear, because it\u2019s inside the nose and it looks like I have this bullring under,\u201d said Ruud, who was the runner-up at Roland-Garros to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023. \u201cIt will return, don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
      "For other players, like Nicol\u00e1s Jarry, the strips are more than a trend \u2014 they\u2019re a necessity. After nasal surgery in 2020, the Chilean still needed help to draw air into his nose, so he puts them on for every practice and every match he plays.",
      "\u201cWithout it, I cannot breathe. My nostrils shut when I try,\u201d he said, inhaling to demonstrate for a reporter. \u201cOthers don\u2019t have that issue and still use them.\u201d",
      "Jarry definitely has noticed a recent spike in interest among players. He said that even though he's worn the strips for years, including at this French Open, other competitors on tour never asked about them \u2014 until Alcaraz started wearing one last year, sometimes in black, sometimes in pink.",
      "\u201cOthers have asked me, and many are trying it,\" said Jarry, who sported a beige-colored strip in Paris. \"But before him? Nothing.\u201d",
      "There are those, like 2024 US Open runner-up Jessica Pegula, who are tempted to try.",
      "\u201cI have a horrible deviated septum. I can\u2019t really breathe out of one side of my nose,\" said Pegula, who will play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round Saturday. \u201cMaybe I should start wearing one.\u201d",
      "She admits, though, that the aesthetic aspect might be a deal-breaker.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" Pegula said with a smile, \u201cif I have the confidence to rock one.\u201d",

      "The announcement follows an earlier Trump administration step to limit COVID-19 vaccinations among healthy people under age 65.",
      "Until now, the U.S. \u2013 following guidance from independent experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 has recommended yearly COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.",
      "Together, the moves have left health experts, vaccine makers and insurers uncertain about what to advise and what comes next.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to add a lot of confusion overall,\u201d said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.",
      "Some of this season\u2019s vaccine is still available. Insurance industry experts say if people had insurance coverage before Kennedy\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s highly unlikely that would have ended instantly based on the secretary\u2019s video announcement. That means if someone could find a shot, they'd likely be able to get one for now.",
      "Who will be able to get what vaccines this fall is still unclear.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers plan to issue updated COVID-19 shots in the late summer or fall. But the Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to limit approval of seasonal shots to seniors and others at high risk, pending more studies of everyone else.",
      "Even if the U.S. approves vaccines only for certain groups, it still may be possible for others to get the shot depending on the outcome of upcoming advisory meetings, regulatory moves and decisions from insurers and employers.",
      "Insurers base coverage decisions on the recommendations of that CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It\u2019s not clear what role that panel now will play. Paying out of pocket could cost about $200.",
      "But some insurers and employers may decide to still cover the shots regardless of the new recommendations, said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the non-profit KFF, which studies health care issues. She noted that they may view the expense as worthwhile if it avoids a higher bill from someone hospitalized by the coronavirus.",
      "The FDA published a list of health conditions it said would qualify, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. The CDC has a more extensive list.",
      "But, again, it isn't yet known how this will play out. For example, it could be hard for people to prove they're qualified. If they're vaccinated at a drugstore, for instance, the pharmacist wouldn't normally know about underlying health problems or even ask. Kates said it's unclear whether Kennedy's move would affect whether doctors recommend the shot.",
      "And Sethi, the UW-Madison expert, said \u201cthis elephant in the room\u201d is that blocking vaccination to the healthy may mean people who have a risk factor and simply don't know it will miss out.",
      "Adding to the confusion, the FDA included pregnancy and recent pregnancy on the list of conditions that would qualify someone for a shot \u2014 but Kennedy said that pregnancy was no longer a qualification in his announcement this week.",
      "COVID-19 complications during pregnancy can include preterm birth as well as serious illness in the mother, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said it \u201cstrongly reaffirms\u201d its recommendation for vaccination during pregnancy.",

      "A verdict is expected in one of France's largest-ever child sex abuse cases",
      "A French court will deliver its verdict Wednesday in one of the country\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse cases, which has raised questions about how a pedophile surgeon was able to rape hundreds of victims over a period spanning more than two decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, a 74-year-old former surgeon, stands accused of raping and sexually assaulting 299 children. On Friday, prosecutors requested the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, describing Le Scouarnec as \u201ca devil in a white coat.\u201d He's already serving a 15-year prison sentence, for a conviction in 2020 for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces.",
      "The new trial in Brittany, western France, began in February and has laid bare a pattern of abuse between 1989 and 2014. Most of the victims were unconscious or sedated hospital patients at the time of the assaults. The average age was 11. Among the victims were 158 boys and 141 girls.",
      "During the trial, advocacy groups have accused health authorities of inaction after they were notified as soon as 2005 of Le Scouarnec\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography pictures.",
      "At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.",
      "\u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments.",
      "\u201cMore could have been done,\" Kellenberger said. \"Things could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.",
      "Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial came as activists continue to push to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to three to 20 years in prison.",
      "In a separate case focusing on alleged abuse at a Catholic school, an inquiry commission of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse over five decades.",
      "Victims of Le Scouarnec have, however, complained of a perceived lack of attention.",
      "\"This trial, which could have served as an open-air laboratory to expose the serious failings of our institutions, seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large,\u201d a group of victims said in a statement.",
      "Not all victims were initially aware they had been abused. Some were contacted by investigators after their names appeared in journals kept by Le Scouarnec, in which he meticulously documented his crimes. Others only realized they had been hospitalized at the time after checking medical records. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial.",
      "Using the cover of medical procedures, the former abdominal and digestive surgeon took advantage of moments when children were alone in their hospital rooms. His method was to disguise sexual abuse as clinical care, targeting young patients who were unlikely to remember the encounters.",
      "The notebooks, which detail the abuse in graphic language, have become central to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "Despite the scope of the allegations, Le Scouarnec has remained calm and composed throughout the trial.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them as people,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were the destination of my fantasies. As the trial went on, I began to see them as individuals, with emotions, anger, suffering and distress.\u201d",
      "He said his first act of abuse occurred in 1985, when he raped his 5-year-old niece.",
      "While he offered apologies to some victims, his demeanor struck many as detached and emotionless.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t show emotion, that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it, but I don\u2019t express it.\u201d",
      "The case first came to light in April 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor told her mother that the man next door had exposed himself and touched her through the fence separating their properties.",
      "A search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions.",
      "\u201cJo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec says he no longer feels any sexual attraction to children, but there\u2019s no way to verify that,\u201d Kellenberger, the prosecutor, told the court. \u201cExperts concluded that we cannot rely on his word alone and that his potential for future danger remains significant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are seeking not only a 20-year prison sentence with a two-thirds minimum term, but also a post-sentence preventive detention, a rarely used measure in France that applies to the country\u2019s most dangerous offenders. If approved, Le Scouarnec could be held indefinitely in a secure socio-medical facility, even after serving his time.",
      "A third trial is expected in the coming years, following the emergence of new allegations during this trial, including further abuse involving his granddaughter.",

      "In March, MSF said that 92 people had died of cholera in Sudan\u2019s White Nile State, where 2,700 people had contracted the disease since late February.",
      "Sudan plunged into war more than two years ago, when tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group, or RSF, exploded with battles in Khartoum and across the country.",
      "Since then, at least 20,000 people have been tallied as being killed, though the number is likely far higher, and the African nation has been engulfed by what the United Nations says is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.",
      "More than 14 million people have been displaced and forced from their homes and disease outbreaks, famine and atrocities have mounted as the country entered its third year of war.",
      "Sudan's Health Minister Haitham Ibrahim said on Saturday that the recent increase in cholera cases is estimated to average 600 to 700 per week, over the past four weeks.",
      "He attributed the surge to the return of many Sudanese to the Khartoum region \u2014 people who had fled their homes to escape the fighting and who are now coming back. Their returns have strained the city's dwindling water resources, he said.",
      "Last week, the Sudanese military said it had regained control of the Greater Khartoum area from the paramilitary forces.",
      "On Monday, Mohanad Elbalal, co-founder of the Khartoum Aid Kitchen, said he was told that 12 people had died of cholera in Omdurman, including a relative of one of his kitchen staff.",
      "Bakker, the MSF coordinator, said Tuesday that the group's treatment centers in Omdurman are overwhelmed and that the \u201cscenes are disturbing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany patients are arriving too late to be saved,\" she said. \"We don\u2019t know the true scale of the outbreak, and our teams can only see a fraction of the full picture.\u201d",
      "She called for a united response, including water, sanitation and hygiene programs and more treatment facilities.",

      "France\u2019s lower house of parliament has adopted a bill to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication",
      "PARIS -- France\u2019s lower house of parliament adopted a bill Tuesday to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow across Europe for legal end-of-life options.",
      "The National Assembly vote is a key step on the long-debated issue, though others remain before the bill can become law.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thinking of all the patients and their loved ones that I\u2019ve met over more than a decade. Many are no longer here, and they always told me: Keep fighting,\" said Olivier Falorni, the bill's general rapporteur, amid applause from fellow lawmakers.",
      "The proposed measure on lethal medication defines assisted dying as allowing use under certain conditions so that people may take it themselves. Only those whose physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone would be able to get help from a doctor or a nurse.",
      "The bill, which received 305 votes in favor and 199 against, will be sent to the Senate, where the conservative majority could seek to amend it. A definitive vote on the measure could take months to be scheduled amid France\u2019s long and complex process. The National Assembly has final say over the Senate.",
      "Activists have criticized the complexity and length of the parliamentary process that they say is penalizing patients waiting for end-of-life options.",
      "In parallel, another bill on palliative care meant to reinforce measures to relieve pain and preserve patients\u2019 dignity was also adopted Tuesday, unanimously.",
      "To benefit, patients would need to be over 18 and be French citizens or live in France.",
      "A team of medical professionals would need to confirm that the patient has a grave and incurable illness \u201cat an advanced or terminal stage,\u201d is suffering from intolerable and untreatable pain and is seeking lethal medication of their own free will.",
      "Patients with severe psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease won\u2019t be eligible.",
      "The person would initiate the request for lethal medication and confirm the request after a period of reflection. If approved, a doctor would deliver a prescription for the lethal medication, which could be taken at home or at a nursing home or a health care facility.",
      "A 2023 report indicated that most French citizens back legalizing end-of-life options, and opinion polls show growing support over the past 20 years.",
      "Initial discussions in parliament last year were abruptly interrupted by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly, plunging France into a months-long political crisis.",
      "\u201cWhat a long road it has been, contrary to what the public thought, contrary to what the French people believed,\u201d said Jonathan Denis, president of the Association for the Right to Die With Dignity (ADMD).",
      "Earlier this month, Macron suggested he could ask French voters to approve the measure via referendum if parliament discussions get off track.",
      "Macron on Tuesday called the vote an important step, adding on social media that \"with respect for different sensibilities, doubts, and hopes, the path of fraternity I had hoped for is gradually beginning to open. With dignity and humanity.\u201d",
      "Many French people have traveled to neighboring countries where medically assisted suicide or euthanasia are legal.",
      "Medically assisted suicide involves patients taking, of their own free will, a lethal drink or medication prescribed by a doctor to those who meet certain criteria. Euthanasia involves doctors or other health practitioners giving patients who meet certain criteria a lethal injection at their own request.",
      "\u201cI cannot accept that French men and women have to go to Switzerland \u2014 if they can afford it \u2014 or to Belgium to be supported in their choice, or that French men and women are being accompanied clandestinely in other countries,\" Denis said.",
      "French religious leaders this month issued a joint statement to denounce the bill, warning about the dangers of an \u201canthropological rupture.\u201d The Conference of Religious Leaders in France (CRCF), which represents the Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist communities, said the proposed measures risk exerting pressure on older people and those with illnesses or disabilities.",
      "Assisted suicide is allowed in Switzerland and several U.S. states. Euthanasia is currently legal in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Canada, Australia, Colombia, Belgium and Luxembourg under certain conditions.",
      "In the U.K., lawmakers are debating a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales after giving it initial approval in November.",

      "The problem, aid workers say, is the U.S. hasn't made clear what programs are lifesaving, or whether whatever funding is left will continue after July 1.",
      "The aid group CARE has warned that 4.6 million people in Somalia are projected to face severe hunger by June, an uptick of hundreds of thousands of people from forecasts before the aid cuts.",
      "The effects are felt in rural areas and in Mogadishu, where over 800,000 displaced people shelter. Camps for them are ubiquitous in the city's suburbs, but many of their centers for feeding the hungry are now closing.",

      "Ma\u2019ow, the bereaved father, is a tailor. He said he had been unable recently to provide three meals a day for his family of six. His wife had no breast milk for Maka'il, whose malnutrition deteriorated between multiple trips to the hospital.",

      "One Alight Africa worker, Abdullahi Hassan, confirmed that the group had to close all their nutrition centers in several districts of Mogadishu.

      "BEIRUT -- A system of thousands of ridges and canals across a floodplain in southern Iraq has long been believed to be the remnant of a massive agricultural system built by slave labor.",
      "Now an international team of archaeologists has found new evidence to support the theory.",
      "The team undertook testing to determine the construction dates of some of the massive earthen structures and found that they spanned several centuries, beginning around the time of a famous slave rebellion in the 9th century A.D. The research findings were published Monday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "The enslaved people from that era are known today as the \u201cZanj,\u201d a medieval Arabic term for the East African Swahili coast, although there are different theories about where in Africa most of them actually came from.",
      "They carried out a large-scale revolt in Iraq in 869 AD under the Abbasid state, known today as the \u201cZanj rebellion.\u201d The rebellion lasted for more than a decade until the Abbasid state regained control of the region in 883 A.D.",
      "Many descendants of those enslaved people now live in the southern port city of Basra in modern-day Iraq.",
      "While they are part of the fabric of modern-day Iraq, \u201ctheir history has not been actually written or documented very well in our history,\u201d said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archaeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah in Iraq, who was part of the research team. Researchers from Durham and Newcastle universities in the U.K., Radboud University in the Netherlands, and the University of Basra in Iraq also took part.",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s why this (finding) is very important, and what is next actually is to protect at least some of these huge structures for future work. It is minority heritage,\u201d he said.",

      "All four of the ridge crests sampled date to the period between the late ninth to mid-13th century A.D., situating their construction during the period when slave labor was in use in the area \u2014 and providing evidence that the use of slave labor likely continued for several centuries after the famous rebellion.",
      "Their findings demonstrate \u201cthat these features were in use for a substantially longer period than previously assumed and, as such, they represent an important piece of Iraqi landscape heritage,\u201d the researchers wrote.",
      "The finding comes at the time of a resurgence of archaeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \u201ccradle of civilization,\u201d but where archaeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The covert operation was described as one for the \u201chistory books\u201d by Ukraine\u2019s president. In the span of a few hours on Sunday, nearly a third of Moscow\u2019s strategic bomber fleet was destroyed or damaged with cheaply made drones sneaked into Russian territory, according to Ukrainian officials.",
      "The undertaking by Ukraine\u2019s Security Service, codenamed \u201cSpiderweb,\u201d involved more than 18 months of painstaking planning and great risk. It was personally overseen by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "It came to fruition at a time in the 3-year-old war when peace talks have failed to deliver the unconditional ceasefire long-sought by Kyiv, and as Moscow continues to launch record-breaking numbers of drone and missile barrages.",
      "The attack on Sunday encapsulates Ukraine\u2019s wartime strategy: Outnumbered, outgunned and dependent on Western partners, Ukrainian military planners have sought innovative and cost-effective means to exact Russian losses, often leaning on the element of surprise.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the Ukrainian attack so far:",
      "Zelenskyy said 117 drones were used in the operation in which four military airfields were attacked resulting in the severe damage or destruction of 34% of Russia\u2019s fleet of air missile carriers.",
      "The complex operation was directed from an office that was next door to an office of the Russian security service, the FSB, Zelenskyy said, without elaborating on where in Russia it was. Executing it involved smuggling in first-person view, or FPV, drones to Russia, where they were placed in wooden containers, which were eventually taken by truck close to the airfields.",
      "From there, the drones flew to strike Russia\u2019s strategic bombers. Social media footage shared by Russian media on the day of the attack showed drones rising from inside the containers. By the end, over 40 Russian warplanes were severely damaged or destroyed with costs estimated to be around $7 billion, according to Ukraine's security service.",
      "Among the most striking targets was Belaya air base in the Siberian region of Irkutsk \u2014 over 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) away from Ukraine.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry in a statement confirmed the attacks, saying they damaged aircraft and sparked fires on air bases in the Irkutsk region, as well as the Murmansk region in the north. It said strikes were also repelled in the Amur region in Russia\u2019s Far East and in the western regions of Ivanovo and Ryazan, the ministry said.",
      "There was no way to independently verify the claims from either side.",
      "Strategic aircraft, including the A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22M, were destroyed in the attack, according to the SBU.",
      "Moscow has previously used Tu-95 and Tu-22M long-range bombers to launch missiles at Ukraine, while A-50s are used to coordinate targets and detect air defenses and guided missiles. Ukraine has long hoped to degrade Russia\u2019s ability to deploy bombers that launch deadly missile barrages against Ukrainian cities, against which Kyiv has limited means to respond.",
      "The loss of the planes could reduce Russia\u2019s ability to deliver devastating missile barrages against Ukraine.",
      "The attack comes right as Moscow has unleashed a record-breaking number of drones and missiles against Ukraine to degrade domestic weapons production capabilities, shatter morale and consume Kyiv\u2019s limited quantities of air defense missiles. Often these attacks have also struck civilians.",
      "The attack also gives Ukraine a morale boost at a time when peace talks have sputtered and could undermine Russian confidence that it can win the war with ease.",
      "It was launched a day before a round of direct peace talks took place in Istanbul on Monday. It also occurred on the same day as Russia launched a record number of 472 drones against Ukraine in yet another barrage.",
      "\u201cThe enemy thought it could bomb Ukraine and kill Ukrainians with impunity and without end. But that is not the case. We will respond to Russian terror and destroy the enemy everywhere \u2014 at sea, in the air, and on land,\u201d said the head of the SBU, Vasyl Maliuk, on Monday.",
      "\u201cAnd if necessary, we\u2019ll get them from underground too,\u201d he added.",
      "Despite suffering setbacks and shortcomings on the battlefield, throughout the war Kyiv has sought to focus on Russia\u2019s rear to cripple and neutralize combat capabilities.",
      "Sunday\u2019s operation is perhaps the most brazen in a series mounted by Ukraine.",
      "In April 2022, Ukraine sank the Moskva, the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, after striking it with two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles. The sinking marked a major Ukrainian victory in the war.",
      "In October 2022, a Ukrainian attack damaged the Kerch Bridge, which links Russia to Moscow-annexed Crimea. The bridge, which holds important strategic and symbolic value, was hit again in July 2023.",
      "A year later, in August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring military incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region, the first time Russian territory was occupied by an invader since World War II. It dealt a humiliating blow to the Kremlin. Russia claimed in April 2025 that it had fully reclaimed the border territory, though Ukraine insists it still has troops present there.",

      "After climbing the ranks, Xu wielded considerable influence as a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission without, it appears, falling afoul of China's party anti-corruption forces, who brought down several other high ranking retired and serving military leaders, including two former defense ministers. China has offered no information on the situation involving the pair, stirring rumors of a major shakeup in the ranks concerning corruption or spying for the U.S..",
      "China has not fought a major campaign since the 1950-53 Korean War, so Xu built his career largely on his adherence to the party line and fealty to the leader of the time, who like Xi now, serves as chairman of the Central Military Commission.",

      "The European Union is preparing \u201ccountermeasures\u201d against the United States if the two sides cannot reach a deal after surprise U.S. tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing negotiations between Brussels and Washington",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The European Union on Monday said it is preparing \u201ccountermeasures\u201d against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing, wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.",
      "Last week, ahead of Friday's surprise announcement, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to \u201caccelerate talks\u201d on a deal. \u201cIn the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,\u201d European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.",
      "He said the EU is finalizing an expanded list of countermeasures that would automatically take effect on July 14 or earlier. That\u2019s the date when a 90-day pause, intended to ease negotiations, ends in tariffs announced by the two economic powerhouses on each other. About halfway through that grace period, Trump announced a 50% tariffs on steel imports.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away. Top officials at the EU\u2019s executive commission says they\u2019re pushing hard for a trade deal to avoid a 50% tariff on imported goods.",
      "Negotiations will continue on Wednesday in Paris in a meeting between the EU\u2019s top trade negotiator, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, and his counterpart, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.",
      "The EU could buy more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the U.S., and lower duties on cars, but it isn't likely to budge on calls to scrap the value added tax \u2014 which is akin to a sales tax \u2014 or open up the EU to American beef.",
      "The EU has offered the U.S. a \u201czero for zero\u201d outcome in which tariffs would be removed on both sides for industrial goods including autos. Trump has dismissed that, but EU officials have said it\u2019s still on the table.",
      "The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on steel imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are also so ubiquitous in packaging that they\u2019re likely to pack a punch across consumer products.",

      "Sweden is the latest country to examine its international adoption policies after allegations of unethical practices, particularly in South Korea,",
      "The commission was formed in 2021 following a report by Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter detailing the Scandinavian country\u2019s problematic international adoption system. Monday\u2019s recommendations were sent to Minister of Social Services Camilla Waltersson Gr\u00f6nvall.",
      "\u201cThe assignment was to investigate whether there had been irregularities that the Swedish actors knew about, could have done and actually did,\u201d Anna Singer, a legal expert and the head of the commission, told a press conference. \u201cAnd actors include everyone who has had anything to do with international adoption activities.",
      "\"It includes the government, the supervisory authority, organization, municipalities and courts. The conclusion is that there have been irregularities in the international adoptions to Sweden.\u201d",
      "The commission called on the government to formally apologize to adoptees and their families. Investigators found confirmed cases of child trafficking in every decade from the 1970s to the 2000s, including from Sri Lanka, Colombia, Poland and China.",
      "Singer said a public apology, besides being important for those who are personally affected, can help raise awareness about the violations because there is a tendency to download the existence and significance of the abuses.",
      "An Associated Press investigation, also documented by Frontline (PBS), last year reported dubious child-gathering practices and fraudulent paperwork involving South Korea\u2019s foreign adoption program, which peaked in the 1970s and `80s amid huge Western demands for babies.",
      "The AP and Frontline spoke with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and Europe and examined thousands of pages of documents to reveal evidence of kidnapped or missing children ending up abroad, fabricated child origins, babies switched with one another and parents told their newborns were gravely sick or dead, only to discover decades later they\u2019d been sent to new parents overseas.",

Denmark\u2019s only international adoption agency said it was shutting down and Switzerland apologized for failing to prevent illegal adoptions. France released a scathing assessment of its own culpability.",
      "South Korea sent around 200,000 children to the West for adoptions in the past six decades, with more than half of them placed in the U.S. Along with France and Denmark, Sweden was a major European destination of South Korean children, adopting nearly 10,000 of them since the 1960s.",

      "LONDON -- The United Kingdom will build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe as part of a boost to military spending designed to send a message to Moscow \u2014 and Washington.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain \u201ccannot ignore the threat that Russia poses\u201d as he pledged to undertake the most sweeping changes to Britain's defenses since the end of the Cold War more than three decades ago.",
      "\u201cWe have to recognize the world has changed,\" Starmer told the BBC. \u201cWith greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.\u201d",
      "The government is to respond to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It's the first such review since 2021, and lands in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and by the re-election of President Donald Trump last year.",
      "Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \u201cfighting big tank battles on European landmass\u201d are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.",
      "Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air sea and in cyberspace.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \u201ca message to Moscow, and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a historic low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.",
      "Healey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \u201con track\u201d and that there's \u201cno doubt\u201d it will hit 3% before 2034.",
      "Starmer said the 3% goal is an \u201cambition,\u201d rather than a firm promise, and it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.",
      "Starmer said he wouldn't make a firm pledge until he knew \u201cprecisely where the money is coming from.\u201d",
      "Even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.",
      "Monday's announcements include building \u201cup to 12\u201d nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion in Britain's nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be scarce.",
      "The government will also increase conventional Britain\u2019s weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.",
      "Starmer said rearming would create a \u201cdefense dividend\u201d of well-paid jobs \u2014 a contrast to the post-Cold War \u201cpeace dividend\u201d that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.",
      "Like other NATO members, the U.K. has been reassessing its defense spending since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Healey said Russia is \u201cattacking the U.K. daily,\u201d with 90,000 cyberattacks from state-linked sources directed at the U.K.\u2019s defense over the last two years. A cyber command to counter such threats is expected to be set up as part of the review.",
      "\u201cThis is a message to Moscow,\u201d Healey told the BBC.",
      "It's also a message to Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defense.",
      "European countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don\u2019t pull their weight.",
      "James Cartlidge, defense spokesman for the main opposition Conservative Party, welcomed more money for defense but was skeptical of the government's 3% pledge,",
      "\u201cAll of Labour\u2019s strategic defence review promises will be taken with a pinch of salt unless they can show there will actually be enough money to pay for them,\u201d he said.",

      "Polls closed and poll workers began counting colored ballots Sunday night with the question hanging in the air of what will become of Mexico's judiciary, the answer to which will only emerge in the coming days as results roll in.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority announced late in the night that 13% of Mexico's 100 million voters cast ballots at the polls, lagging far behind the 60% turnout just a year before during the country's presidential election.",
      "Nevertheless, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called the voting \u201ca complete success.\"",
      "\u201cMexico is the most democratic country in the world,\u201d she added.",
      "Experts warned of startling low turnout in the lead up to the historic elections due to the mindboggling array of unfamiliar choices and the novelty of voting for judges. Experts say those factors may throw into question the legitimacy of the election, which has faced months of fierce scrutiny.",
      "Sheinbaum, a member of Mexico\u2019s ruling party, Morena, rejected the criticisms and insisted the election would only only make Mexico more democratic and root out corruption in a system that most people in the country believe is broken.",
      "\u201cWhoever says that there is authoritarianism in Mexico is lying,\u201d she said. \u201cMexico is a country that is only becoming more free, just and democratic because that is the will of the people.\u201d",
      "While some voters said they felt pushed to vote in an election they felt would determine the fate of the country\u2019s democracy, many more expressed a deep sense of apathy, citing disillusionment due to decades of corruption and lack of basic information about the vote.",
      "\u201cI'm not interested (in voting). Parties and their messages \u2014 they come and they go. It's all the same,\u201d said Raul Bernal, a 50-year-old factory worker in downtown Mexico City walking is dog.",
      "Even without the final tally, the results of the vote are set to transform Mexico's judiciary. Morena overhauled the court system late last year, fueling protests and criticism that the reform is an attempt by those in power to seize on their political popularity to gain control of the branch of government until now out of their reach.",
      "\u201cIt's an effort to control the court system, which has been a sort of thorn in the side\" of those in power, said Laurence Patin, director of the legal organization Juicio Justo in Mexico. \u201cBut it's a counter-balance, which exists in every healthy democracy.\u201d",
      "Instead of judges being appointed on a system of merit and experience, Mexican voters have cast ballots to choose between some 7,700 candidates vying for more than 2,600 judicial positions.",
      "Some of the country's voting centers opened with only a trickle of people and small lines forming throughout the day.",
      "Esteban Hern\u00e1ndez, a 31-year-old veterinary student, said he didn\u2019t agree with electing judges and doesn\u2019t support Morena, but came to vote because \u201csince there isn\u2019t much participation, my vote will count more.\u201d",
      "He had studied the candidates on a website listing their qualifications and decided to pick those who had doctorates. Other critics said they only voted for the Supreme Court and other top courts.",
      "Francisco Torres de Le\u00f3n, a 62-year-old retired teacher in southern Mexico, called the process \"painstaking because there are too many candidates and positions that they\u2019re going to fill.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who had pushed through the judicial reform but remained out of the public eye since leaving office last year, voted in Chiapas near his ranch.",
      "\u201cI wanted to participate in this historic election,\u201d he said. \u201cNever in the history of our country \u2026 have the people decided and had the right to elect judges.\u201d",
      "The process has raised concerns.",
      "Civil society organizations like Defensorxs have raised red flags about a range of candidates running for election, including lawyers who represented some of Mexico's most feared cartel leaders and local officials who were forced to resign from their positions due to corruption scandals.",
      "Also among those putting themselves forward are ex-convicts imprisoned for years for drug trafficking to the United States and a slate of candidates with ties to a religious group whose spiritual leader is behind bars in California after pleading guilty to sexually abusing minors.",
      "Others like Martha Tamayo, a lawyer and former congresswoman from conflict-ravaged Sinaloa, cast doubt on projections that the election could hand even more power over to criminals and criminal groups, simply because they already have a strong control over courts.",
      "\u201cThe influence of criminal groups already exists,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cartels go with the judges (bribe them) whether they are elected or not.\u201d",
      "The public has been plagued by confusion over a voting process that Patin warned has been hastily thrown together. Voters often have to choose from more than a hundred candidates who are not permitted to clearly voice their party affiliation or carry out widespread campaigning.",
      "As a result, many Mexicans said they were going into the vote blind, though others voting Sunday noted they supported the process despite the confusion.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority has investigated voter guides being handed out across the country, in what critics say is a blatant move by political parties to stack the vote in their favor.",
      "\u201cPolitical parties weren\u2019t just going to sit with their arms crossed,\u201d Patin said.",
      "While still unsure if his vote would improve access to justice for many Mexicans, 61-year-old actor Manuel Jos\u00e9 Contreras defended the election, Sheinbaum and her party. He cast his ballot with a tone of hope.",
      "\u201cThe reform has its problems but we needed an urgent change,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to start with something.\u201d",

      "Poles awakened Monday to a clear albeit close result that returns a nationalist politician to the presidency who has pledged to hinder the centrist, pro-EU government for the remainder of its term.",
      "Here's what to know about Karol Nawrocki, Poland\u2019s newly elected conservative president:",
      "Nawrocki is a 42-year-old historian who had no political experience prior to the campaign and who was not even a party member until he was tapped by the conservative Law and Justice party that governed Poland from 2015 to 2023.",
      "Nawrocki heads the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland. Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Many of them oppose abortion and LGBTQ+ visibility and say Nawrocki reflects the traditional values they grew up with.",
      "He was also the preferred favorite of U.S. President Donald Trump, with the American conservative group CPAC holding its first meeting in Poland last week during the campaign to give him a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised him and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "His campaign echoed themes popular on the American right. A common refrain from his supporters is that Nawrocki will restore \u201cnormality,\u201d as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags appeared at his rallies.",
      "Nawrocki performed better in the first round than expected, an indication he was underestimated in the polling.",
      "Nawrocki's quick political rise has not been without controversy, with reports linking him to underworld figures whom he met while boxing or working as a hotel security guard in the past.",
      "Nawrocki has also been linked to a scandal involving the acquisition of a Gdansk apartment from an elderly pensioner named Jerzy. Allegations suggest Nawrocki promised to care for Jerzy in return but failed to fulfill the commitment, leading the man to end up in a publicly funded retirement home.",
      "His shifting explanations raised questions about his transparency and credibility. After the scandal erupted he donated the apartment to a charity.",
      "It recently emerged that Nawrocki took part in a 2009 Gdansk brawl involving about 140 rival soccer fans, some later convicted of crimes. Nawrocki described the fight as a form of \u201cnoble\u201d combat.",
      "Polish media have also reported on his connections to gangsters and the world of prostitution.",
      "His critics say all of these things make him unfit to represent Poland as the head of state but many right-wing voters don\u2019t believe the allegations and accuse the media of using its power to hurt him, creating what appears to be a rallying effect around him.",
      "It's unclear what effect, if any, these scandals had on the outcome of Sunday's result.",

      "The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. And businesses and investors must contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Trump imposed last month to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",

      "\"The United States has unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions, exacerbating the uncertainty and instability of bilateral economic and trade relations,\u201d while China has stood by its commitments, the statement said.",
      "It also threatened unspecified retaliation, saying China will \u201ccontinue to take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\u201d",
      "And in response to recent comments by Trump, it said of the U.S.: \u201cInstead of reflecting on itself, it has turned the tables and unreasonably accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts.\u201d",
      "Trump stirred further controversy Friday, saying he will no longer be nice with China on trade, declaring in a social media post that the country had broken an agreement with the United States.",
      "Hours later, Trump said in the Oval Office that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and \u201chopefully we\u2019ll work that out,\u201d while still insisting China had violated the agreement.",
      "\u201cThe bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cSo much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\u201d",

      "Both countries are in a race to develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, with Washington seeking to curb China\u2019s access to the most advanced computer chips.

      "Conservative Karol Nawrocki has won Poland\u2019s weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland\u2019s weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%.",
      "The race had Poland on edge since a first round of voting two weeks earlier, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.",
      "An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture a couple of hours later.",
      "The outcome suggests that Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.",
      "Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.",
      "Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide \u2014 so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples.",
      "But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic.",
      "Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made both to voters and the EU.",
      "Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.",
      "Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.",
      "The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule.",
      "The strategy clearly worked.",
      "Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \u201cnoble\u201d fights in his life. The revelations did not seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president.",
      "He welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.",
      "A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \u201cnormality,\u201d as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Nawrocki has also echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After months of political turmoil, South Korea will elect a new president this week to succeed conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted over his brief but shocking imposition of martial law.",
      "Surveys suggested liberal Lee Jae-myung is heavily favored to win Tuesday's snap election, riding on a wave of public disappointment of Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle in December. The main conservative candidate, Kim Moon Soo, wants a come-from-behind victory, but observers say his refusal to directly criticize Yoon made it difficult for him to narrow the gap with Lee.",
      "The winner will be sworn in as president on Wednesday without the typical two-month transition period. The new leader faces the urgent tasks of trying to heal the deep domestic divide over Yoon's action as well as focusing on U.S. President Donald Trump's America-first policy and North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program.",
      "Lee, who represents the main liberal Democratic Party, is the favorite to win the elections. In three Gallup Korea surveys released last week, 46% to 49% of respondents picked Lee as their choice for next president, giving him a comfortable lead over Kim with 35% to 37%.",
      "Lee narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, and spearheaded parliament\u2019s two votes to overturn Yoon\u2019s martial law decree and impeach him, before the Constitutional Court formally dismissed him in April.",
      "Lee\u2019s outspoken criticism of South Korea's conservative establishment and calls to punish those involved in Yoon's martial law enactment have caused worries among his opponents that Lee's election would further polarize the country.",
      "Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, has fought an uphill battle against Lee as his People Power Party struggles to restore public confidence. Kim's opposition to Yoon's impeachment and reluctance to explicitly criticize the disgraced leader drove him away from moderate voters, analysts say.",
      "Four other politicians are running for the presidency, including Lee Jun-seok of the small conservative New Reform Party, who has categorically rejected Kim's request to field a unified candidate between them to prevent a split in conservative votes.",
      "The election has got ugly, with candidates levelling damaging statements, personal attacks and even sexually offensive language against each other without unveiling clear, long-term vision for South Korea.",
      "During last week's televised debate, Lee Jae-myung labelled Kim as \"Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s avatar,\u201d while Kim called Lee a \u201charbinger of monster politics and dictatorship.\u201d Lee Jun-seok faced withering public criticism after he used graphic references to women\u2019s bodies to criticize Lee Jae-myung's son over his purported sexually explicit online slur targeting a female singer.",
      "Unlike past elections, North Korea's nuclear program hasn't emerged as a hot-button topic, suggesting that most candidates share a view that South Korea has few immediate ways to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons. Dealing with Trump's aggressive tariffs policy hasn't been a divisive issue either.",
      "Kim has instead focused on portraying Lee Jae-myung as a dangerous leader who would likely wield excessive power by putting the judiciary under his control and revising laws to stop his criminal trials. Lee Jae-myung, for his part, has repeatedly questioned Kim's ties with Yoon.",
      "South Korea\u2019s new president will have little time to negotiate with the United States before July 9, when Trump\u2019s 90-day pause on global tariffs expires, potentially exposing South Korean products to 25% tax rates. A U.S. federal court has recently ruled that Trump lacks authority to impose the tariffs, but the White House has appealed, leaving the long-term outcome unclear.",
      "South Korea's outgoing administration was trying to finalize a comprehensive \u201cpackage\u201d deal with the U.S. by early July to soften the blow to the country\u2019s trade-dependent economy.",
      "Lee has accused government officials of rushing negotiations for short-term political gains and said it wouldn\u2019t serve national interests to obsess over securing an early agreement with Washington. Kim said he would place a priority on a meeting with Trump as soon as possible to resolve trade issues.",
      "The next government in Seoul may also struggle to ease security tensions over North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear weapons program, which has been complicated by North Korea's support of Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "Lee has expressed a willingness to improve ties with North Korea but acknowledged that it would be difficult to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un anytime soon. He said he would support Trump's push to resume nuclear diplomacy with North Korea. Kim Moon Soo has promised to build up South Korea's military capability and win a stronger U.S. security support, suggesting he would uphold Yoon's hard-line approach on North Korea.",
      "The most pressing domestic issue facing the new president will be a starkly divided nation that had seen millions rallying for months to either support or denounce Yoon.",
      "Yoon had labeled Lee\u2019s party as \u201canti-state\u201d forces abusing their legislative majority to block his agenda. He also endorsed unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that the liberals had benefited from election fraud, prompting his supporters to rally in the streets with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d signs.",
      "Lee has issued a message of unity and vowed not to seek political vengeance against his rivals if elected. But his critics doubt that, suspecting Lee could use investigations of Yoon's martial law decree as a vehicle to suppress his opponents.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal saga is likely to overshadow the early months of Seoul\u2019s next government, as the former president continues to stand trial on high-stakes rebellion charges, which carry a possible sentence of death or life in prison.",

      "The United Kingdom is shifting its stance on the disputed Western Sahara, backing Morocco's plan to offer its people limited autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty",
      "RABAT, Morocco -- The United Kingdom on Sunday became the latest country to back Morocco\u2019s position on the disputed Western Sahara, calling its plan to keep the territory under Moroccan control \u201cthe most credible, viable and pragmatic\u201d way to resolve the decades-long conflict.",
      "At a joint press conference in Morocco's capital, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the United Kingdom was changing its position to support Morocco's plan to offer the area limited autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. He and Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita lauded the two countries' ties on security and trade, noting Morocco's role as co-host of the 2030 FIFA World Cup.",
      "\"The time for a resolution and to move this issue forward is long-overdue, and would strengthen the stability of North Africa,\" Lammy said.",
      "He also reiterated support for the United Nations-led process and called on Morocco to \u201cexpand on details of what autonomy within the Moroccan State could entail for the region.\u201d",
      "Western Sahara is a strip of coastal desert rich in phosphates and fish that the United Nations has considered a \u201cnon-self-governing territory\u201d throughout almost 50 years of dispute. It's claimed by both Morocco and Polisario, a pro-independence group that operates out of refugee camps in southwestern Algeria.",
      "The shift fulfills one of Morocco's primary foreign policy objectives and makes the United Kingdom the third permanent member of the United Nations Security Council to back its position, following France and the United States. Since 1991, the United Nations has administered a peacekeeping mission designed to hold a referendum to determine the status of the disputed territory, all of which is under Morocco's control except for a small sliver near the Algerian border.",
      "After years of conflict, the area has recently emerged as a hotspot for investment, drawing European and American firms interested in fishing, agriculture and infrastructure projects that would allow for the transmission of wind and solar power. As negotiations have stalled, Morocco has invested heavily in the region and sought support from trade partners. Polisario has taken its fight to international courts, arguing that Morocco does not have the right to trade resources belonging to the Sahrawi people while the conflict remains unresolved.",
      "The countries exchange billions of dollars worth of cars, fruits and vegetables. The two are partnering on XLinks, a renewable energy storage and transmission project whose backers hope will power millions of British homes.",
      "The British shift angered Algeria, Morocco's regional rival, which in a statement on Sunday blasted Morocco's plan as \u201cempty of content and incapable of contributing to a serious and credible settlement of the conflict.\u201d",
      "Polisario Front representatives didn\u2019t respond to questions about the United Kingdom's stance.",

      "Protesters led by university students blocked bridges in the capital Belgrade and rallied in 30 other Serbian cities and towns as they also marked exactly seven months since a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station in the north, killing 16 people and sparking the massive wave of anti-corruption protests.",

      "Many people in Serbia believe that the deadly Nov. 1 canopy collapse in Novi Sad was the result of flawed renovation work on the station building, and they link the disaster to alleged government corruption in major infrastructure projects with Chinese state companies.",
      "Vucic, whom critics have accused of imposing authoritarian rule in Serbia since coming to power over a decade ago, initially dismissed the possibility of holding early elections but on Friday suggested they could take place, though without saying exactly when.",
      "Sunday's protests included commemoration ceremonies for the victims of the Novi Sad crash and student marches and blockades. In Belgrade, crowds halted traffic at two key bridges over the Sava River for three hours, while protesters in Novi Sad carried a white wreath for the canopy collapse victims as they walked toward the crash site.",

      "No one has been sentenced in connection with the tragedy in Novi Sad and doubts prevail that ongoing legal proceedings will uncover the alleged corruption behind the crash.",
      "Serbia is formally seeking European Union entry but the ruling populists have been accused of clamping down on democratic freedoms, including free media. Vucic's authorities have stepped up pressure on protesters, including police detentions, intimidation and physical attacks.",

      "LONDON -- For soccer-loving transgender women in England, it's been a tough day, as the ban on their participation in women's teams came into force.",
      "To show its solidarity with the community and against the decision by the governing body of English soccer (football), Goal Diggers Football Club, a London-based trans-inclusive women\u2019s team, held a tournament Sunday.",
      "The message was clear. Yes, it's a sad day, but no one will stop us playing the sport we love.",
      "Around 100 people \u2014 women, trans women, non-binary and gender non-conforming players \u2014took part in the \u201cLet The Dolls Play Tournament\u201d in Islington, north London.",
      "And everyone present appeared to find comfort in their solidarity despite the occasional foul, intentional or not.",
      "\u201cYou know they\u2019re not going take away this community, my friends,\u201d said Paula Griffin, a 60-year-old transgender woman. \"And there\u2019s such a powerful message coming from that, that the people who care about women\u2019s sport are the people who play the women\u2019s sports. And these are the people that are my friends.\u201d",
      "Griffin, like the others, are still dismayed by the decision last month by England's Football Association to ban transgender women from playing on women's soccer teams from June 1 following a U.K. Supreme Court ruling in April.",
      "The F.A. said it had decided to change its rules that had allowed transgender athletes to play in women's soccer teams if they had reduced testosterone levels.",
      "The decision came in the wake of the ruling from the U.K.'s Supreme Court that defined a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female. The head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said after the ruling that transgender women would be excluded from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams.",
      "While the ruling was cheered by some feminist groups, it was condemned by trans-rights groups who said it would have a broad and detrimental impact on daily life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really upset me,\u201d said Billie Sky, a 28-year-old transgender woman. \"I have to say, this has been a really hard week. I\u2019ve struggled to get out of bed at times. I\u2019m doing my best to get through work and come to things like this, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s really difficult.\u201d",
      "The issue has been polarizing in the U.K. and beyond, particularly in the United States, where President Donald Trump has signed executive orders to prohibit participation of transgender athletes in sports and to use a rigid definition of the sexes, rather than gender, for federal government purposes. The orders are being challenged in court.",
      "For those present at the tournament in north London on Sunday morning, the fight will go on but for now, it's about keeping the sport they love close.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s the whole point of today, is we\u2019re trying to just reclaim the day and make it a really joyous time to spend together,\u201d said Jahnavi Kalayil, a 26-year-old woman. \"And I think it\u2019s definitely happened, everyone\u2019s had a really great time. Whether winning or losing the games, it\u2019s more about just coming together as a community and making sure we\u2019re standing up for our trans siblings.\u201d",

      "Federal Transportation Department officials plan to join the CEO of United Airlines and airport officials in providing an update on operations at New Jersey\u2019s biggest airport Monday afternoon. The runway was scheduled to go back into service Monday, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.",
      "Crews worked day and night to complete the $121 million construction project ahead of schedule and ease some of the problems at the airport.

      "Five air traffic controllers went on 45-day trauma leaves after the first radar and communications outage at the Philadelphia facility on April 28, and another one is out on medical leave. That left the facility with only 16 certified controllers and five supervisors. Officials have said there are another 16 experienced controllers in training that should get certified sometime between now and October.",
      "The FAA limited the Newark airport to 28 arrivals and 28 departures an hour last month because of the construction and staff shortages. The agency has said that it expects to be able to bump up the number of flights daily in Newark to 34 arrivals and 34 departures once the runway construction is done. But it's not immediately clear if the FAA will have to wait until the controllers on trauma leave are scheduled to return around the middle of the month.",
      "Before the air traffic control problems this spring, 38 or 39 flights typically took off and landed hourly at the Newark airport.",
      "The FAA has said it will revisit the limits again in October because it hopes to have more controllers trained by then.",
      "The government also upgraded the software at the air traffic control facility after a second radar outage on May 9. That helped prevent a repeat problem on May 11 when there was another problem with the lines carrying the radar signal down from New York.",

      "The EU could possibly buy more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the U.S., as well as lower duties on cars, but it isn't likely to budge on calls to scrap the value added tax \u2014 which is akin to a sales tax \u2014 or open up the EU to American beef.",

      "The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on steel imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases.

      "The government announced military plans in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It's the first such review since 2021, and lands in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and by the re-election of President Donald Trump last year.",
      "Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \u201cfighting big tank battles on European landmass\u201d are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.",
      "Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air sea and in cyberspace.",
      "The measures include increasing production of submarines and weapons and \u201clearning the lessons of Ukraine,\" which has rapidly developed its drone technology to counter Moscow's forces and even hit targets deep inside Russia.",
      "The government said the U.K, will also establish a cyber command to counter \u201cdaily\u201d Russia-linked attacks on Britain's defenses.",
      "Monday\u2019s announcements include building \u201cup to 12\u201d nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds in Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret.",
      "The government will also increase conventional Britain\u2019s weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.",
      "Starmer said rearming would create a \u201cdefense dividend\u201d of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs \u2014 a contrast to the post-Cold War \u201cpeace dividend\u201d that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \u201ca message to Moscow,\u201d and transform the country\u2019s military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a two-century low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.",
      "Healey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \u201con track\u201d and that there\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d it will hit 3% before 2034.",
      "Starmer said the 3% goal is an \u201cambition,\u201d rather than a firm promise, and it\u2019s unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.",
      "Starmer said he wouldn\u2019t make a firm pledge until he knew \u201cprecisely where the money is coming from.\u201d",
      "Even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.",
      "It's also a message to Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defense.",
      "European countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don\u2019t pull their weight.",
      "Starmer said his government would make \u201cBritain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will never fight alone,\u201d he said. \u201cOur defense policy will always be NATO-first.\u201d",
      "James Cartlidge, defense spokesman for the main opposition Conservative Party, welcomed more money for defense but was skeptical of the government's 3% pledge,",
      "\u201cAll of Labour\u2019s strategic defence review promises will be taken with a pinch of salt unless they can show there will actually be enough money to pay for them,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist conservative, as its next president \u2014 a win that signals a turn to the right in one of the European Union's member states",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian and staunch nationalist, as its next president in a closely watched vote that signals a resurgence of right-wing populism in the heart of Europe.",
      "Nawrocki, who is set to take office on Aug. 6, is expected to shape the country\u2019s domestic and foreign policy in ways that could strain ties with Brussels while aligning the Central European nation of nearly 38 million people more closely with the administration of President Donald Trump in the United States.",
      "Here are some key takeaways:",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s victory underscores the enduring appeal of nationalist rhetoric among about half of the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union, and its deep social divisions.",
      "The 42-year-old historian who had no previous political experience built his campaign on patriotic themes, traditional Catholic values, and a vow to defend Poland's sovereignty against the EU and larger European nations like Germany.",
      "His win also reflects the appeal of right-wing nationalism across Europe, where concerns about migration, national sovereignty, and cultural identity have led to surging support for parties on the right \u2014 even the far right in recent times.",
      "Far-right candidates did very well in Poland's first round of voting two weeks earlier, underlining the appeal of the nationalist and conservative views. Nawrocki picked up many of those votes.",
      "As his supporters celebrate his win, those who voted for the defeated liberal candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, worry that it will hasten the erosion of liberal democratic norms.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s presidency presents a direct challenge to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who returned to power in late 2023 pledging to mend relations with the EU and restore judicial independence which Brussels said was eroded by Law and Justice, the party that backed Nawrocki.",
      "But Tusk's coalition \u2014 a fragile alliance of centrists, leftists, and agrarian conservatives \u2014 has struggled to push through key promises including a civil union law for same-sex couples and a less restrictive abortion law.",
      "Nawrocki, who opposes such measures, will have the power to veto legislation, complicating Tusk\u2019s agenda and potentially triggering political gridlock.",
      "Nawrocki's election could signal a stronger relationship between Poland and the Trump administration.",
      "Poland and the U.S. are close allies, and there are 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in Poland, but Tusk and his partners in the past have been critical of Trump. Nawrocki, however, has a worldview closely aligned with Trump and his Make America Great Again ethos.",
      "Trump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago and his administration made clear in other ways that he was its preferred candidate.",
      "While Nawrocki has voiced support for Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russian aggression, he does not back Ukrainian membership in NATO and has questioned the long-term costs of aid \u2014 particularly support for refugees.",
      "His rhetoric has at times echoed that of Trump, for instance by accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of what he said was insufficient gratitude for Poland\u2019s assistance. With growing public fatigue over helping Ukrainian refugees, Nawrocki\u2019s approach could shift Poland\u2019s posture from strong ally to conditional partner if the war drags on much longer.",
      "The election result is a setback for the EU, which had welcomed Tusk\u2019s return in 2023 as a signal of renewed pro-European engagement.",
      "Nawrocki and the Law and Justice party have criticized what nationalists view as EU overreach into Poland's national affairs, especially regarding judicial reforms and migration policy.",
      "While the president does not control day-to-day diplomacy, Nawrocki\u2019s symbolic and veto powers could frustrate Brussels\u2019 efforts to bring Poland back into alignment with bloc standards, particularly on rule-of-law issues.",
      "Though an EU member, Poland has its own currency, the zloty, which weakened slightly on Monday morning, reflecting investor concerns over potential policy instability and renewed tensions with EU institutions.",
      "Billions of euros in EU funding has been linked to judicial reforms which Tusk's government will now be unlikely to enact without presidential cooperation.",

      "The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. And businesses and investors must contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",

      "It also threatened unspecified retaliation, saying China will \u201ccontinue to take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\u201d",
      "And in response to recent comments by Trump, it said of the U.S.: \u201cInstead of reflecting on itself, it has turned the tables and unreasonably accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts.\u201d",
      "Trump stirred further controversy Friday, saying he will no longer be nice with China on trade, declaring in a social media post that the country had broken an agreement with the United States.",
      "Hours later, Trump said in the Oval Office that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and \u201chopefully we\u2019ll work that out,\u201d while still insisting China had violated the agreement.",
      "\u201cThe bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cSo much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\u201d",
      "The Trump administration also stepped up the clash with China in other ways last week, announcing that it would start revoking visas for Chinese students studying in the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "\u201cLilo & Stich\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u2014The Final Reckoning\u201d dominated the box office charts again after fueling a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend. Theaters in the U.S. and Canada had several new films to offer this weekend as well, including Sony\u2019s family friendly \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d and the A24 horror movie \u201cBring Her Back. \u201d According to studio estimates Sunday, it added up to a robust $149 million post-holiday weekend that\u2019s up over 120% from the same timeframe last year.",
      "Disney\u2019s live-action hybrid \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d took first place again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. It was enough to pass \u201cSinners\u201d to become the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Globally, its running total is $610.8 million. \u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, is still going strong in its seventh weekend with another $5.2 million, bumping it to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million globally.",
      "The eighth \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie also repeated in second place, with $27.3 million from 3,861 locations. As with \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d that's down 57% from its opening. With $122.6 million in domestic tickets sold, it\u2019s performing in line with the two previous installments. But with a reported production budget of $400 million, profitability is a ways off. Internationally, it added $76.1 million (including $25.2 million from China where it just opened), bringing its global total to $353.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis is the year of longterm playability,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst. \u201cThe currency of word of mouth and the strong hold is more important than opening weekend dollars.\u201d",
      "Leading the newcomers was Sony\u2019s \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d with an estimated $21 million from 3,809 locations. The movie brings Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio together to train a new kid, the kung fu prodigy Li Fong ( Ben Wang ). Chan starred in a 2010 reboot of the 1984 original, while Macchio has found a new generation of fans in the series \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d which just concluded a six-season run.",
      "Reviews might have been mixed, but opening weekend audiences gave the PG-13 rated film a strong A- CinemaScore and 4.5 stars on PostTrak. It also only cost a reported $45 million to produce and has several weeks until a new family-friendly film arrives. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d opened earlier internationally and has a worldwide total of $47 million.",
      "Fourth place went \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d which earned $10.8 million in its third weekend. The movie is the highest-grossing in the franchise, not accounting for inflation, with $229.3 million globally.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s doubling of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum could hit Americans in an unexpected place: grocery aisles",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s doubling of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum could hit Americans in an unexpected place: grocery aisles.",
      "The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on those imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are so ubiquitous in packaging, they\u2019re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.",
      "\u201cRising grocery prices would be part of the ripple effects,\u201d says Usha Haley, an expert on trade and professor at Wichita State University, who added that the tariffs could raise costs across industries and further strain ties with allies \u201cwithout aiding a long-term U.S. manufacturing revival.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away, in such a whiplash-inducing frenzy it\u2019s hard to keep up. He insisted the latest tariff hike was necessary to \u201ceven further secure the steel industry in the U.S.\u201d",
      "That promise, though, could be at odds with his pledge to reduce food costs.",
      "Rising grocery prices, Trump has said, were among the biggest reasons voters swung his way. A look around a supermarket makes clear how many products could be impacted by new taxes on steel and aluminum, from beer and soda to dog food to can after can of beans, fruit, tomato paste and more.",
      "\u201cIt plays into the hands of China and other foreign canned food producers, which are more than happy to undercut American farmers and food producers,\u201d insists Can Manufacturers Institute president Robert Budway. \u201cDoubling the steel tariff will further increase the cost of canned goods at the grocery store.\u201d",
      "Budway says production by domestic tin mill steel producers, whose products are used in cans, have dramatically decreased in recent years, making manufacturers reliant on imported materials. When those prices go up, he says, \u201cthe cost is levied upon millions of American families.\u201d",
      "Food companies were already warily assessing the administration\u2019s tariffs before the latest hike, which Trump said would go into effect on Wednesday. The Campbell Co., whose soup cans are a staple for millions of Americans, has said it was working to mitigate the impact of tariffs but may be forced to raise prices. ConAgra Brands, which puts everything from cans of Reddi-Whip to cooking sprays like Pam on supermarket shelves, likewise has pointed to the impact steel and aluminum tariffs have.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t get all of our materials from the US because there\u2019s no supply,\u201d ConAgra CFO David Marberger said at a recent Goldman Sachs conference on global staples.",
      "Beyond the obvious products \u2014 canned foods like tuna, chicken broth and cranberry sauce \u2014 economists warn of a spillover effect that tariffs can have on a gamut of items. If the cost to build a store or buy a truck to haul food rise, the prices of products may follow.",
      "Most Americans will never buy a tractor, but Babak Hafezi, who runs a global consulting firm and teaches international business at American University, says a price spike in such a big-ticket item vital to food production will spill down to all sorts of other items.",
      "\u201cIf a John Deere tractor costs 25% more, consumers pay the price for that,\u201d Hafezi says. \u201cThis trickles down the economy and impacts every aspect of the economy. Some of the trickling is immediate and others are slower to manifest themselves. But yes, prices will increase and choices will decrease.\u201d",
      "Trump appeared before a crowd of cheering steelworkers to unveil the new tariffs at a rally outside Pittsburgh. In a statement, David McCall, president of the United Steelworkers International union, called tariffs \u201ca valuable tool in balancing the scales\u201d but \u201cwider reforms of our global trading system\" are needed.",
      "It may be harder to gauge the weight of tariffs on, say, a can of chickpeas versus that of a new car, but consumers are likely to see myriad indirect costs from the levies, says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade.",
      "\u201cAnybody who\u2019s directly connected to the steel industry, they\u2019re going to benefit. It\u2019s just coming at a very high cost,\u201d Waldkirch says. \u201cYou may get a few more steel jobs. But all these indirect costs mean you then destroy jobs elsewhere. If you were to add that all in, you come up with a pretty large negative loss.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- Before the oppressive summer heat descends on Atlanta, therapist Brittanee Sims usually gets her thick, curly hair braided at a salon to preserve her healthy mane.",
      "But it\u2019s more expensive this year. So she'll only pay for her teenage daughter and son to get their summer hairdos. Not having braided hair \u201ccreates more of a hassle for everything,\u201d said Sims, who counts herself among the tens of millions of women that regularly spend on the Black hair care industry.",
      "Now, she said, she has to \u201cgo home and figure out what I\u2019m gonna do to my hair in the morning, after I went to the gym and it\u2019s messed up with sweating and frizz.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving up prices for products many Black women consider essential, squeezing shoppers and stylists even more as they grapple with inflation and higher rents. Much of the synthetic braiding hair, human hair for extensions, wigs and weaves, styling tools, braiding gel and other products is imported from or has packaging from China, which was subject to a combined 145% tariff in April. India also is a major global source of human hair.",
      "Many Black women have hair types and workplace-favored styles that require careful attention, and they can spend hundreds of dollars at salons each month on extensions, weaves, wigs and braids. The Associated Press spoke with several Black hair industry experts, beauty supply store owners, and wholesale companies, as well as nearly two dozen Black stylists and braiders, some of whom may have to raise prices even as business has slowed.",
      "On Thursday, a federal appeals court reinstated most of Trump's tariffs on imported goods after they were blocked the day before by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "Earlier this month, the United States agreed to drop the 145% tax on goods imported from China to 30% while the two economic superpowers negotiate new trade agreements. Imports from most other countries face baseline tariff rates at 10%.",
      "Regardless, the next few months \u201care already shot\u201d for many items, said Marty Parker, a University of Georgia business professor and supply chain expert who worked in the hair care industry. The costs companies have been facing at ports are making their way down to consumers, supply shortages are getting worse, and it's unclear what will happen if negotiations break down.",
      "\u201cPrices go up very fast and come down very slow,\u201d Parker said.",
      "Some stylists said they're seeing fewer clients because prices are going up for virtually everything.",
      "Atlanta stylists are paying more for hair from China. Atlanta stylist Yana Ellis, who also sells products like wigs, paid an extra $245 in shipping for 52 bundles of hair in March compared to 40 bundles in December. AaNiyah Butler said her shipping costs for human hair more than doubled from February to May. And Dajiah Blackshear found in early May that a beauty supply store raised the cost of the kind of hair she\u2019s used for years by $100.",
      "The store owner said he may have to stop selling that brand of hair because it went up so much. Similarly, some wholesale hair stores have seen higher costs or are expecting them in the coming weeks. Even the typical $6 to $10 cost of a pack of synthetic hair has crept up.",
      "Blackshear doesn't want clients to bring hair because she likes to vet the quality. But if expenses continue to mount, she may have to raise her prices.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely difficult,\u201d she said, especially for clients who are \"having to make those hard decisions, between \u2018do I get my hair done or do I pay my bills?\u2019\u201d",
      "Janice Lowe, who runs 5 Starr Salon in a lower-income neighborhood southeast of Atlanta, has started asking clients to bring hair and is unable to purchase certain products.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m falling behind on my obligations,\u201d she said.",
      "Consultants vary on how much prices will rise, when they\u2019ll go up and for how long \u2014 and the full harm to stylists and consumers could be months away.",
      "The global Black hair care industry was worth about $3.2 billion in 2023, according to market.us, and Black women spend six times more on hair care than other ethnicities.",
      "Stylists often purchase some harder-to-get professional products from door-to-door distributors that buy from wholesale companies or larger distributors that purchase directly from other countries.",
      "Lowe has seen some of her distributors vanish altogether, making it harder to get professional lines such as Black-owned leading professional hair care brand Design Essentials, manufactured in Atlanta at McBride Research Laboratories.",
      "Design Essentials is trying to delay big price increases until 2026 or 2027, and may turn to layoffs or pause promotions to save money, said president Cornell McBride Jr. Most packaging plastics come from China, but ingredients can come from many places.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to put it to the consumer but the person who pays is the consumer in the end,\u201d McBride Jr. said.",
      "Hawa Keita and her mother usually charge customers between $160 and $250 for braiding at their shop, Eve\u2019s African Hair Braiding in College Park southwest of Atlanta. Keita is determined to take losses because their customers \u201ccan\u2019t afford the Atlanta prices,\u201d Keita said.",
      "The cost of a box of 100 packs of braiding hair from China went up for the first time in two years, from $250 to $300, Keita said. They order weekly, often multiple boxes. Some companies say they'll soon raise prices or run out of stock.",
      "Making customers happy is ultimately what will keep the business afloat, Keita said. She smiled as she recounted braiding a young woman\u2019s hair for her birthday with a style she suggested.",
      "\u201cWhen we finished, she gave me the biggest hug, and she was in here screaming and just yelling because she just really loved her hair,\u201d Keita said.",
      "For many Black Americans, especially women, affording their hair care also means confronting unfavorable beauty standards. Georgia State University law professor Tanya Washington said recent discoveries about dangerous chemicals in synthetic hair and hair straightening products have sparked conversations among Black women looking for hairstyles that don't require as much imported products.",
      "But embracing natural hairdos can be daunting for women like the soon-to-be lawyers and clerks Washington advises who face pressure to straighten their hair.",
      "\u201cThat puts everyone who does not have organically, naturally derived straight hair at a disadvantage in these spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that a definition of professionalism that favors one phenotype \u2014 European phenotype \u2014 over all others, is inappropriate.\"",
      "Longstanding income disparities between Black and white American women can also make higher hair care prices untenable. According to the U.S. Census, as of 2023, the median household income in Atlanta is $131,319 for white households and $47,937 for Black households.",
      "It's an inequality issue that professional hairstylists are aware of nationwide.",
      "Stylist Mitzi Mitchell, owner of PIC ONE Beauty Services in Pennsylvania, said she has stocked up on certain products and tools for another year in anticipation of price increases.",
      "She wants to avoid \u201cbootleg\u201d products, which are made illegally and often aren\u2019t as safe, but became much more prevalent in the marketplace during economic downturns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really conscientious about my Black minority clients because we make a heck of a lot less than other nationalities,\u201d said Mitchell, who is Black. \u201cI try to keep prices low so we can continue to have the same services, but I know I will have to raise it.\u201d",

      "In a statement, RealPage applauded Polis' veto, calling it an example of \u201ccourageous leadership.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the right outcome for all of us who desire a healthy housing ecosystem that benefits Colorado renters and housing providers alike,\u201d said Jennifer Bowcock, a spokesperson for the Texas-based firm.",
      "But Polis' decision outraged local housing advocates and the American Economic Liberties Project, a consumer rights advocacy group that has helped lead the fight against RealPage and other companies that use rent-setting algorithms.",
      "\u201cThis veto sends the devastating message that corporate landlords can keep using secret price-fixing algorithms to take extra rent from people who have the least,\u201d said Sam Gilman, co-founder and president of the Community Economic Defense Project, a Colorado-based nonprofit.",
      "RealPage software provides daily recommendations to help landlords and their employees price their available apartments. The landlords do not have to follow the suggestions, but critics argue that because the software has access to a vast trove of confidential data, it helps RealPage's clients charge the highest possible rent.",
      "Although Colorado was the first state to pass a bill targeting rental algorithms, at least six cities have passed similar ordinances over the past year. They include Philadelphia; Minneapolis; San Francisco; Berkeley, California; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Providence, Rhode Island.",
      "RealPage has decried those measures and sued over Berkeley's ordinance, saying it violates the company\u2019s free speech rights and is the result of an \u201cintentional campaign of misinformation and often-repeated false claims\u201d about its products.",
      "RealPage argues that the real driver of high rents is a lack of housing supply. It also says that its pricing recommendations often encourage landlords to drop rents since landlords are incentivized to maximize revenue and maintain high occupancy.",
      "A clause recently added to Republicans\u2019 signature \u201c big, beautiful \u201d tax bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade. On Tuesday, five Democratic senators sent a letter to RealPage asking if the company was involved in getting that clause inserted.",
      "In an email, Bowcock said RealPage was not involved in the AI moratorium language, but she said the company supports \u201ca thoughtful, well-grounded, and consistent regulatory approach to AI, rather than a patchwork of state and local legislation.\u201d",

      "The New York Mets are hiring U.S. Tennis Association CEO Lew Sherr as their new president of business operations",
      "PARIS -- The New York Mets are hiring the person who oversees the U.S. Open tennis tournament, Lew Sherr, as their new president of business operations.",
      "Sherr has been the CEO and executive director of the U.S. Tennis Association since 2022 and has worked there since 2010, including previously as chief revenue officer. His departure was announced by the USTA on Friday; he will remain there until the end of June, then start with the Mets in July.",
      "\u201cFor right now, my focus is the smoothest possible transition,\u201d Sherr said in an interview with The Associated Press at the French Open. \u201cBut I'm hugely excited about what's happening over there. (Mets owners) Steve and Alex Cohen have made a commitment to that team that is unrivaled in sports. You see it on the field, off the field. The energy around the team. The energy around what they\u2019re trying to do for the community with their foundation. The plans for the casino and the hotel and entertainment district.\u201d",
      "Steve Cohen is among the bidders for three casino licenses to be awarded by the New York State Gaming Commission and has been lobbying to have the state legislature reclassify the parking lots adjacent to Citi Field \u2014 also near the facility that hosts the U.S. Open \u2014 from parkland to commercial land for a gaming facility.",
      "The Mets announced Scott Havens' departure as their president of business operations on Tuesday; he was in that post since December 2023. Chief legal officer Katie Pothier, chief marketing officer Andy Goldberg, chief communications officer Nancy Elder and senior vice president of finance Peter Woll have left since November.",
      "The USTA said Brian Vahaly and Andrea Hirsch will be interim co-CEOs during a search for Sherr's replacement. Vahaly is chairman of the USTA Board; Hirsch is the USTA's chief operating officer and chief legal officer.",
      "In Sherr's time as CEO, the USTA has seen growth in tennis participation around the country, along with increases in U.S. Open attendance, sponsorships, and revenue from ticket sales and broadcasting rights.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve taken some big swings,\" Sherr said Friday, \u201cand thankfully, they\u2019re paying off.\u201d",
      "Just last week, he spoke at a news conference in New York to unveil an $800 million project to update Arthur Ashe Stadium and create a player performance center on the tournament grounds. He also made significant changes to this year's U.S. Open mixed doubles event in a bid to attract top singles players, making it a two-day, 16-team competition the week before the singles brackets begin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet, in that I really have loved being part of this organization for 15 years and the opportunities I've had to do just really interesting things \u2014 and not just on the commercial side, but in terms of helping us think about growing the sport,\u201d Sherr said. \"I\u2019m leaving sleeping well at night, knowing (the USTA) is going to be well looked-after.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released a draft analysis of the environmental effects of building a protective tunnel around an aging Enbridge oil pipeline running beneath a channel connecting two Great Lakes",
      "Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project's environmental impacts.",
      "The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.",
      "A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.",
      "With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.",
      "Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.",
      "The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.",
      "Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.",
      "Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.",
      "The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.",
      "Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,\u201d Enbridge officials said in a statement.",
      "The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains \u201can existential threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cChances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes \u2014 our most valuable freshwater resource \u2014 skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.\u201d",
      "Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.",
      "\u201cMy key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump's fossil fuel agenda,\" she said.",
      "Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.",
      "Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.",
      "Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.",
      "Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.",
      "A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.",
      "About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa\u2019s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it\u2019s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.",
      "Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state's contested case process.",

The company is seeking monetary damages and a court order that would stop Aldi from selling products that infringe on its trademarks.",
      "A message seeking comment was left Thursday with Aldi.",
      "In the lawsuit, Mondelez displayed side-by-side photos of multiple products. Aldi\u2019s Thin Wheat crackers, for example, come in a gold box very similar to Mondelez's Wheat Thins. Aldi\u2019s chocolate sandwich cookies and Oreos both have blue packaging. The supermarket's Golden Round crackers and Mondelez\u2019s Ritz crackers are packaged in red boxes.",
      "Aldi, a German discount chain with U.S. headquarters in Batavia, Illinois, keeps prices low by primarily selling products under its own labels.",
      "The chain has faced lawsuits over its packaging before. Last year, an Australian court found that Aldi infringed on the copyright of Baby Bellies snack puffs for young children. In that case, Aldi's packaging featured a cartoon owl and similar colors to the name-brand packaging.",
      "Earlier this year, a U.K. appeals court ruled in favor of Thatchers, a cider company, which sued Aldi over design similarities in the packaging of its lemon cider.",
      "Mondelez said in its lawsuit that the company had contacted Aldi on numerous occasions about \u201cconfusingly similar packaging.\u201d Mondelez said Aldi discontinued or changed the packaging on some items but continued to sell others.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that Aldi infringed on Mondalez's trade dress rights for the packaging of Nutter Butter and Nilla Wafers cookies, and its Premium cracker brand.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices, while American incomes jumped.",
      "Friday\u2019s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.6%. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared to their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",
      "The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump\u2019s tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.",
      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

      "President Donald Trump is holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday to celebrate a details-to-come deal for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in U.S. Steel",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- President Donald Trump is holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday to celebrate a details-to-come deal for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in U.S. Steel, which he says will keep the iconic American steelmaker under U.S.-control.",
      "Though Trump initially vowed to block the Japanese steelmaker\u2019s bid to buy Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, he changed course and announced an agreement last week for what he described as \u201cpartial ownership\u201d by Nippon. It's not clear, though, if the deal his administration helped broker has been finalized or how ownership would be structured.",
      "Trump stressed the deal would maintain American control of the storied company, which is seen as both a political symbol and an important matter for the country\u2019s supply chain, industries like auto manufacturing and national security.",
      "Trump, who has been eager to strike deals and announce new investments in the U.S. since retaking the White House, is also trying to satisfy voters, including blue-collar workers, who elected him as he called to protect U.S. manufacturing.",
      "U.S. Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon Steel issued a statement approving of the proposed \u201cpartnership\u201d but also has not disclosed terms of the arrangement.",
      "State and federal lawmakers who have been briefed on the matter describe a deal in which Nippon will buy U.S. Steel and spend billions on U.S. Steel facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota. The company would be overseen by an executive suite and board made up mostly of Americans and protected by the U.S. government\u2019s veto power in the form of a \u201cgolden share.\u201d",
      "In the absence of clear details or affirmation from the companies involved, the United Steelworkers union, which has long opposed the deal, this week questioned whether the new arrangement makes \u201cany meaningful change\u201d from the initial proposal.",
      "\u201cNippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in U.S. Steel\u2019s facilities if it owned the company outright,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position.\u201d",
      "The White House did not offer any new details Thursday. U.S. Steel did not respond to messages seeking information. Nippon Steel also declined to comment.",
      "No matter the terms, the issue has outsized importance for Trump, who last year repeatedly said he would block the deal and foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, as did former President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump promised during the campaign to make the revitalization of American manufacturing a priority of his second term in office. And the fate of U.S. Steel, once the world\u2019s largest corporation, could become a political liability in the midterm elections for his Republican Party in the swing state of Pennsylvania and other battleground states dependent on industrial manufacturing.",
      "Trump said Sunday he wouldn\u2019t approve the deal if U.S. Steel did not remain under U.S. control and said it will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Channel on Wednesday, Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Dan Meuser called the arrangement \u201cstrictly an investment, a strategic partnership where it\u2019s American-owned, American run and remains in America.\u201d",
      "However, Meuser said he hadn\u2019t seen the deal and added that \"it\u2019s still being structured.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Republican Sen. David McCormick came out in favor of the plan, calling it \u201cgreat\u201d for the domestic steel industry, Pennsylvania, national security and U.S. Steel\u2019s employees. A bipartisan group of senators, joined by then-Senate candidate McCormick, had opposed Nippon Steel\u2019s initial proposed purchase of U.S. Steel for $14.9 billion after it was announced in late 2023.",
      "In recent days, Trump and other American officials began touting Nippon Steel\u2019s new commitment to invest $14 billion on top of its $14.9 billion bid, including building a new electric arc furnace steel mill somewhere in the U.S.",
      "Pennsylvania\u2019s other senator, Democrat John Fetterman \u2014 who lives across the street from U.S. Steel\u2019s Edgar Thomson Steel Works blast furnace \u2014 didn\u2019t explicitly endorse the new proposal. But he said he had helped jam up Nippon Steel\u2019s original bid until \u201cNippon coughed up an extra $14B.\u201d",
      "The planned \u201cgolden share\u201d for the U.S. amounts to three board members approved by the U.S. government, which will essentially ensure that U.S. Steel can only make decisions that\u2019ll be in the best interests of the United States, McCormick said Tuesday on Fox News.",
      "Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is seen as a potential presidential candidate, had largely refrained from publicly endorsing a deal but said at a news conference this week that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the arrangement.",
      "In an interview published Thursday in the conservative Washington Examiner, Shapiro said: \u201cThe deal has gotten better. The prospects for the future of steelmaking have gotten better.\u201d",
      "Chris Kelly, the mayor of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel\u2019s Irvin finishing plant is located, said he was \u201cecstatic\u201d about the deal, though he acknowledged some details were unknown. He said it will save thousands of jobs for his community.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a reprieve from taking steel out of Pittsburgh,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Justice Department has formally moved to dismiss a criminal fraud charge against Boeing and asked a judge to cancel an upcoming trial connected to two plane crashes that killed 346 people",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Justice Department has formally moved to dismiss a criminal fraud charge against Boeing and has asked a judge to cancel an upcoming trial connected to two plane crashes that killed 346 people off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia, according to court documents filed Thursday.",
      "The deal, announced last week, will allow the American aircraft manufacturer to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the 737 Max jetliner before the planes crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.",
      "The \u201cagreement in principle\u201d will require the company to pay and invest more than $1.1 billion, including an additional $445 million for the crash victims\u2019 families, in return for dismissing the criminal case, according to court documents. Dismissing the fraud charge will allow the manufacturer to avoid a possible criminal conviction that could have jeopardized the company\u2019s status as a federal contractor, experts have said.",
      "U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, will decide whether to accept the motion to dismiss, accept the terms of the non-prosecution agreement and whether to cancel the trial. O\u2019Connor on Thursday ordered all the lawyers to present him with a briefing schedule on the government\u2019s motion by June 4.",
      "Some relatives of the passengers who died in the crashes have been pushing for a public trial, the prosecution of former company officials, and more severe financial punishment for Boeing. The Justice Department has noted that the victims\u2019 families had mixed views on the proposed deal.",
      "Nadia Milleron, a Massachusetts resident whose 24-year-old daughter, Samya Stumo, died in the Ethiopia crash, in an email Thursday said it hurt her to read the Justice Department's \u201cfalse\u201d statement that the agreement will secure meaningful accountability, deliver public benefits and bring finality to a complex case whose outcome would otherwise be uncertain.",
      "\u201cThis is not a difficult or complex case because Boeing signed a confession,\u201d Milleron said. \u201cThere will be no accountability as a result of the NPA (non-prosecution deal).\u201d",
      "Boeing said in a statement that the company is committed to complying with its obligations under the resolution, including commitments to further institutional improvements and investments, as well as additional compensation for families of those who died in the two plane crashes.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply sorry for their losses, and remain committed to honoring their loved ones\u2019 memories by pressing forward with the broad and deep changes to our company that we have made to strengthen our safety system and culture,\u201d a Boeing spokesperson said in the statement.",
      "Attorney Mark Lindquist, who represents dozens of the victims' families said in a statement Thursday that although he had wanted to see a more vigorous prosecution, he didn't think it was going to happen.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I can only hope the criminal case and the lawsuits motivated Boeing to improve safety,\u201d Lindquist said. \u201cThat\u2019s what really matters. We all want to walk onto a Boeing plane and feel safe.\u201d",
      "Boeing was accused of misleading the Federal Aviation Administration about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about a new software system that could turn the plane\u2019s nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.",
      "The Max planes crashed after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded until the company redesigned the software.",
      "The Justice Department charged Boeing in 2021 with deceiving FAA regulators about the software and about how much training pilots would need to fly the plane safely. The department agreed not to prosecute Boeing at the time, however, if the company paid a $2.5 billion settlement, including the $243.6 million fine, and took steps to comply with anti-fraud laws for three years.",
      "But last year, federal prosecutors said Boeing violated the terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed last July to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring what could have been a lengthy public trial.",
      "Then in December, O'Connor rejected the plea deal. The judge said the diversity, inclusion and equity, or DEI, policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in picking a monitor to oversee Boeing\u2019s compliance with the agreement.",
      "Under the new agreement, Boeing must retain an \u201cindependent compliance consultant\u201d who will make recommendations for \u201cfurther improvement\u201d and report back to the government, court documents said.",

      "Perfect timing then for NASCAR's \u201cIn-season Challenge\u201d to debut, right?",
      "Well, Wallace forgot that was about to debut.",
      "\u201cFor me to forget about it and remember how exciting it was when they announced, I think it\u2019s going to be big for the fans to tune in and and give them a little bit more ... you\u2019re just invested more,\" Wallace said.",
      "Kyle Larson just tried his latest attempt at \u201cthe Double\u201d of the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600. Count him among those who didn't realize NASCAR's new in-season competition had its field of 32 set after Sunday night's Cup Series race at the Nashville Superspeedway.",
      "\u201cI just really haven\u2019t seen anything promoted about it, so I think it\u2019s easy to forget about it,\" Larson said.",
      "NASCAR announced this new in-season competition in May 2024, so drivers can be forgiven for being focused on the second half of the season.",
      "The format is simple: 32 drivers race for seeding over the next three races starting at Michigan on Sunday and concluding at Pocono on June 22. Drivers are seeded by their best finish for the five-race competition starting at Atlanta.",
      "Then it goes to single elimination with the field cut to 16 at Chicago, eight at Sonoma, four at Dover and the final two at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The winner gets $1 million, and that does get drivers' attention as part of the new media rights deal that includes TNT.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be something fun that you pay attention to, and there\u2019s good money on the line,\u201d said Larson, the 2021 Cup Series champ. \u201cSo, you've just got to be really consistent throughout.\u201d",
      "Chris Buescher of RFK Racing is among those who didn't realize this challenge is starting. He needs race victories after losing points for a penalty at Kansas in May. The prize is nice.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s real money,\" Buescher said. \"But I don\u2019t want that to change how we go to the race track. We need to figure out how to win races. There\u2019s a lot more than that on the line at the end of the year.\u201d",
      "Three-time Cup Series champ Joey Logano compared this event's prize to the money up for grabs in the All-Star Race and this new competition like a stage win.",
      "\u201cThis is a little longer thing, but it\u2019s a race within the race,\" Logano said. \u201cSo you\u2019re not willing to give up a lot to do that, right?\u201d",
      "Denny Hamlin was excited when the In-season Challenge was first announced. Then he saw the courses for this competition, and his enthusiasm dimmed with the number of road courses included.",
      "\u201cTruthfully, we\u2019re going to get pretty lucky or have such a good draw that just things kind of work out,\" Hamlin said. \"I wish it was more conventional ovals, but I think that\u2019s just the way the schedule works out. And it\u2019s unfortunately not probably my prime part of the season.\u201d",
      "Brad Keselowski and his No. 6 Ford for RFK Racing went into Nashville at 32 \u2014 right on the line to be included in that chase for seeding. He hadn't given the competition much thought focused on this season. But he thinks it will be fun once it starts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good for the sport, good for our fans and it\u2019s a competition,\u201d Keselowski said. \"If there\u2019s competition, we want to win it. But that said, I think our heads down on one week at a time, in some ways one day at a time. ... And it\u2019s hard to look further ahead than that.\u201d",
      "With Ryan Blaney's first victory of the season at Nashville Superspeedway, Team Penske now has its three drivers qualified for the NASCAR Cup playoffs even with Nashville the first race of the second half of this year.",
      "Blaney, who hadn't won since November, joined Austin Cindric, who won at Talladega, and three-time Cup Series champ Joey Logano, a winner at Texas. Josh Berry, whose Wood Brothers Racing team has a relationship with Team Penske, also won at Las Vegas.",
      "Michael Nelson, president of Team Penske's NASCAR operations, said it was nice to have that pressure off all the teams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s obviously pretty awesome to have a little bit of that pressure off for the guys,\" Nelson said. \"And again ... it gives you a chance to go out and take some chances here and there and try to rack up a bunch of wins. So now we\u2019re grateful to be at this point with our cars this time of year.\u201d",
      "Carson Hocevar matched his career-best finish driving from 26th to second at Nashville. The 22-year-old driver in his second Cup Series season with Spire Motorsports ticked off Ricky Stenhouse Jr. with his aggressive style.",
      "Hocevar clipped Stenhouse on Lap 106 of 300, sending him into the wall and out of the race. Stenhouse said Hocevar was overly aggressive and will talk to the young driver. Just not after the race.",

      "Tyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner beamed as they carried the Indiana Pacers shiny, new Eastern Conference championship trophy into their postgame news conferences Saturday night",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The Pacers have finally ended the franchise's 25-year NBA Finals drought, achieving the unthinkable after starting 10-15 and looking like anything but a title contender.",
      "Now Indiana will try to exorcise the demons of its decades-long, snake-bitten history and actually win the title when the Pacers take on the Oklahoma City in the NBA Finals.",
      "\u201cIt is really a special thing that happened 25 years ago, I wasn\u2019t even six months old,\u201d Tyrese Haliburton said after Indiana's series-ending victory over New York. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fans who have never seen success from this organization, especially people around my age. They weren\u2019t alive for it.",
      "\"So it\u2019s really special what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re just trying to keep making this a special place, a place where people want to come.\u201d",
      "The Pacers play in a state where basketball is treated like religion, championship teams become royals and players and coaches emerge as revered figures when they achieve the unexpected like these Pacers.",
      "But Indiana hasn't always been that dream destination for NBA players, instead being tabbed as snake-bitten franchise for most of its 48 seasons in the league.",
      "\u2014 After winning three ABA titles, it took a telethon to save the financially floundering NBA newbie in July 1977.",
      "\u2014 The Pacers made just one playoff appearance during their first decade in the NBA, losing both games to Philadelphia.",
      "\u2014 Fans booed resoundingly when the Pacers used a first-round draft pick on Reggie Miller in 1987 instead of home-state favorite Steve Alford.",
      "\u2014 And their pathway to championships in the 1990s seemed hopelessly blocked by Michael Jordan's Bulls or Patrick Ewing's the Knicks until the breakthrough run in 2000 only to lose to Shaquille O'Neal, the late Kobe Bryant and the Lakers.",
      "And though Miller was still playing at a high level, it has taken another quarter-century to make it back.",
      "The journey hasn't been an easy one.",
      "This Pacers team rallied to eliminate some other snake-bitten opponents. They knocked out the 2021 NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks, the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers and the rival Knicks. The second final chapter begins Thursday in Oklahoma City.",
      "The expectations were different 25 years ago.",
      "Donnie Walsh revamped Indiana's roster by surrounding Miller with younger players following the 1999-2000 season, and four seasons later the Pacers posted the league's best record in 2003-04. They wound up losing the conference final in six games to Detroit.",
      "Then came the franchise-changing Malice in the Palace brawl in November 2004.",
      "Several lengthy suspensions gutted the team, derailing Miller's last title run while sending the franchise into a downward spiral. Larry Bird fired coach Rick Carlisle, his friend and ex-teammate, two years later and his departure was followed by a rash of devastating injuries.",
      "Danny Granger's budding career was cut short by knee tendinitis. Paul George suffered a compound fracture in his right leg in 2014 and he was traded to Oklahoma City in 2017. Two years later, All-Star guard Victor Oladipo ruptured his right quadriceps tendon and was subsequently traded, too.",
      "Myles Turner experienced most of the ups and downs of that decade from the Pacers locker room, and it only made his opportunity to hug Miller and Nancy Leonard, the widow of former Pacers longtime coach and broadcaster Bobby \u201cSlick\u201d Leonard, so much sweeter after winning the conference crown.",
      "\u201cIt was just pure excitement, pure validation,\" Turner said. \u201cJust all the years, all the hate, all the love, everything in between. So, man, in that moment, it was just pure exuberance.\u201d",
      "Turner was a pivotal piece \u2014 not the central one \u2014 when president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard embarked on another rebuild midway through the 2021-22 season to form the core of this year's squad.",
      "He started by dealing All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis to Sacramento for Haliburton. Five months later, Indiana acquired forward Aason Nesmith from Boston for Malcolm Brogdon. And when Pritchard sent Bruce Brown to Toronto for Pascal Siakam in January 2024, Pritchard figured the Pacers finally had their big three.",
      "Fans were skeptical, but the Pacers ushered in a new era of basketball, one that combined Indiana's favorite sport with its longtime auto racing tradition, creating a track-like pace brand of basketball.",
      "In some ways, these Pacers are a throwback to their ABA roots \u2014 fast, high scoring, flurries of 3-pointers and made-for-television entertainment right down to the dance team.",
      "\u201cThe pace, it just fits who I am as a person, like the way I play the game,\u201d said Siakam, who won a championship ring with Toronto. \u201cWe have a lot of people who look down on us as an underdog and that's my style. I like that because that's been me my whole life.\u201d",
      "The Pacers will open as the underdog against the Thunder, the team George landed with all those years ago. Two former ABA powers, San Antonio and Denver, have won NBA titles. But if the Pacers can capture the Larry O'Brien trophy, they would be the league's only team to be crowned ABA and NBA champions.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to be popping champagne,\u201d said Carlisle, who led the Dallas Mavericks to the 2010-11 title. \u201cGetting to the NBA Finals is an accomplishment. But if you start looking at it that way, you'll go into it with the wrong mindset. When you get to this point of the season, its two teams, it's one goal so it becomes an all or nothing thing.\u201d",

      "It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all.",
      "Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought, with a 50-50 chance within the next 10 billion years. That\u2019s essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time.",
      "\u201cAs it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,\u201d the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy.",
      "While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity.",
      "\u201cWe likely won\u2019t live to see the benefit,\" lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email.",
      "Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn\u2019t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away.",
      "Sawala\u2019s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash.",
      "Past theories put a collision between the two \u2014 resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda \u2014 as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner.",
      "For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way's movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances.",
      "Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years.",
      "\u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study,",
      "A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy's name.",
      "More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what's happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos.",
      "While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\" according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\"",

      "\u201cThe new helicopter is a multi-role, digital instrument that is geared toward the demands of the 21st century,\u201d Palmas told a ceremony at Cyprus\u2019 main Paphos air base.",
      "Two more of the state-of-the-art aircraft will be delivered, while the contract with Airbus allows for the purchase of additional helicopters, said Airbus Senior Vice President for the H145 program Daniela Dudek.",

      "Scientists say 4 billion people, about half the world\u2019s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses, and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cAlthough floods and cyclones often dominate headlines, heat is arguably the deadliest extreme event,\u201d the report said. Many heat-related deaths are unreported or are mislabeled by other conditions like heart disease or kidney failure.",
      "The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries in the world, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change.",
      "Caribbean islands were among the hardest hit by additional extreme heat days. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, endured 161 days of extreme heat. Without climate change, only 48 would have occurred.",
      "\u201cIt makes it feel impossible to be outside,\u201d said Charlotte Gossett Navarro, chief director for Puerto Rico at Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit focused on social and environmental issues in Latino communities, who lives in the San Juan area and was not involved in the report.",
      "\u201cEven something as simple as trying to have a day outdoors with family, we weren\u2019t able to do it because the heat was too high,\" she said, reporting feeling dizzy and sick last summer.",
      "When the power goes out, which happens frequently in Puerto Rico in part because of decades of neglected grid maintenance and damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017, Navarro said it is difficult to sleep. \u201cIf you are someone relatively healthy, that is uncomfortable, it\u2019s hard to sleep ... but if you are someone who has a health condition, now your life is at risk,\u201d Gossett Navarro said.",
      "Heat waves are silent killers, said Friederike Otto, associate professor of climate science at Imperial College London, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fall dead on the street in a heat wave ... people either die in hospitals or in poorly insulated homes and therefore are just not seen,\u201d he said.",
      "Low-income communities and vulnerable populations, such as older adults and people with medical conditions, suffer the most from extreme heat.",
      "The high temperatures recorded in the extreme heat events that occurred in Central Asia in March, South Sudan in February and in the Mediterranean last July would have not been possible without climate change, according to the report. At least 21 people died in Morocco after temperatures hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) last July. People are noticing temperatures are getting hotter but don't always know it is being driven by climate change, said Roop Singh, head of urban and attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, in a World Weather Attribution statement.",
      "\u201cWe need to quickly scale our responses to heat through better early warning systems, heat action plans, and long-term planning for heat in urban areas to meet the rising challenge,\u201d Singh said.",
      "City-led initiatives to tackle extreme heat are becoming popular in parts of South Asia, North America, Europe and Australia to coordinate resources across governments and other agencies. One example is a tree-planting initiative launched in Marseille, France, to create more shaded areas.",
      "The report says strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient.",
      "But without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.",

      "Google will return to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it\u2019s navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power",
      "Google will return to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department's attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it's navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power.",
      "The legal and technological threats facing Google are among the key issues that will be dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared as an illegal monopoly by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last year.",
      "Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers will attempt to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.",
      "Google lawyers are expected to assert only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice's four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.",
      "\u201cOver weeks of testimony, we heard from a series of well-funded companies eager to gain access to Google\u2019s technology so they don\u2019t have to innovate themselves,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t hear was how DOJ\u2019s extreme proposals would benefit consumers.\u201d",
      "After the day-long closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can't take until the judge orders a remedy.",
      "While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry's future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.",
      "The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won't rein in Google's power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that's the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.",
      "Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet's main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.",
      "The debate over Google's fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.",
      "Apple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department's proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn't compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.",
      "In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department's proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company's business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.",
      "The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department's proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry.",
      "Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realize their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. \u201cDevelopers will be overcome by uncertainty\u201d if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",
      "Buy Y Combinator, an incubator that has helped create hundreds of startups collectively worth about $800 billion filed documents pushing for the dramatic overhaul of Google, whose immense power has discouraged venture capitalists from investing in areas that are considered to be part of the company's \u201ckill zone.\u201d",
      "Startups \u201calso need to be able to get their products into the hands of users, free from restrictive dealing and self-preferencing that locks up important distribution channels. As things stand, Google has locked up the most critical distribution channels, freezing the general search and search text advertising markets into static competition for more than a decade,\u201d Y Combinator told Mehta.",

    "story": [
      "In a pristine corner of the Amazon, Brazilian and British scientists have spent more than two decades simulating drought to understand how the rainforest might respond to a drier future",
      "CAXIUANA NATIONAL FOREST, Brazil -- A short walk beneath the dense Amazon canopy, the forest abruptly opens up. Fallen logs are rotting, the trees grow sparser and the temperature rises in places sunlight hits the ground. This is what 24 years of severe drought looks like in the world\u2019s largest rainforest.",
      "But this patch of degraded forest, about the size of a soccer field, is a scientific experiment. Launched in 2000 by Brazilian and British scientists, Esecaflor \u2014 short for \u201cForest Drought Study Project\u201d in Portuguese\u2014 set out to simulate a future in which the changing climate could deplete the Amazon of rainfall. It is the longest-running project of its kind in the world, and has become a source for dozens of academic articles in fields ranging from meteorology to ecology and physiology.",
      "Understanding how drought can affect the Amazon, an area twice the size of India that crosses into several South American nations, has implications far beyond the region. The rainforest stores a massive amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. According to one study, the Amazon stores the equivalent of two years of global carbon emissions, which mainly come from the burning of coal, oil and gasoline. When trees are cut, or wither and die from drought, they release into the atmosphere the carbon they were storing, which accelerates global warming.",
      "To mimic stress from drought, the project, located in the Caxiuana National Forest, assembled about 6,000 transparent plastic rectangular panels across one hectare (2.5 acres), diverting around 50% of the rainfall from the forest floor. They were set 1 meter above ground (3.3 ft) on the sides to 4 meters (13.1 ft) above ground in the center. The water was funneled into gutters and channeled through trenches dug around the plot\u2019s perimeter.",
      "Next to it, an identical plot was left untouched to serve as a control. In both areas, instruments were attached to trees, placed on the ground and buried to measure soil moisture, air temperature, tree growth, sap flow and root development, among other data. Two metal towers sit above each plot.",
      "In each tower, NASA radars measure how much water is in the plants, which helps researchers understand overall forest stress. The data is sent to the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where it is processed.",
      "\u201cThe forest initially appeared to be resistant to the drought,\" said Lucy Rowland, an ecology professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "That began to change about 8 years in, however. \"We saw a really big decline in biomass, big losses and mortality of the largest trees,\u201d said Rowland.",
      "This resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the total weight of the vegetation and the carbon stored within it from the plot. The main findings were detailed in a study published in May in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. It shows that during the years of vegetation loss, the rainforest shifted from a carbon sink, that is, a storer of carbon dioxide, to a carbon emitter, before eventually stabilizing.",
      "There was one piece of good news: the decades-long drought didn\u2019t turn the rainforest into a savanna, or large grassy plain, as earlier model-based studies had predicted.",
      "In November, most of the 6,000 transparent plastic covers were removed, and now scientists are observing how the forest changes. There is currently no end date for the project.",
      "\u201cThe forest has already adapted. Now we want to understand what happens next,\u201d said meteorologist Jo\u00e3o de Athaydes, vice coordinator of Esecaflor, a professor at the Federal University of Para and coauthor of the Nature study. \u201cThe idea is to see whether the forest can regenerate and return to the baseline from when we started the project.\u201d",
      "During a visit in April, Athaydes guided Associated Press journalists through the site, which had many researchers. The area was so remote that most researchers had endured a full-day boat trip from the city of Belem, which will host the next annual U.N. climate talks later this year. During the days in the field, the scientists stayed at the Ferreira Penna Scientific Base of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, a few hundred yards (meters) from the plots.",
      "Four teams were at work. One collected soil samples to measure root growth in the top layer. Another gathered weather data and tracking soil temperature and moisture. A third was measured vegetation moisture and sap flow. The fourt focused on plant physiology.",
      "\"We know very little about how drought influences soil processes,\u201d said ecologist Rachel Selman, researcher at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Nature study, during a break.",
      "Esecaflor's drought simulation draws some parallels with the past two years, when much of the Amazon rainforest, under the influence of El Nino and the impact of climate change, endured its most severe dry spells on record. The devastating consequences ranged from the death of dozens of river dolphins due to warming and receding waters to vast wildfires in old-growth areas.",
      "Rowland explained that the recent El Nino brought short-term, intense impacts to the Amazon, not just through reduced rainfall but also with spikes in temperature and vapor pressure deficit, a measure of how dry the air is. In contrast, the Esecaflor experiment focused only on manipulating soil moisture to study the effects of long-term shifts in rainfall.",
      "\u201cBut in both cases, we\u2019re seeing a loss of the forest\u2019s ability to absorb carbon,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, along with the loss of forest cover.\u201d",

      "The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply",
      "NEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply.",
      "Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can\u2019t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits.",
      "The Associated Press\u2019 CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from the survey:",
      "The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.",
      "CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.",
      "The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.",
      "\u201c2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,\u201d said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.",
      "Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent \u201clong-overdue\u201d increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills.",
      "Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023.",
      "Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted.",
      "Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards.",
      "The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar.",
      "\u201cFor CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,\" said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. \"Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.\u201d",
      "Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is \u201cthat share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.\" But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a \u201cphenomenal rise\u201d in CEO compensation \u201ctracking recent years' market performance,\u201d which has \"widened the pay gap within workplaces.\"",
      "Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla\u2019s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle.",
      "Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30.",
      "At half the companies in AP\u2019s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company\u2019s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018.",
      "The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries.",
      "Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included.",
      "\u201cWith CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,\u201d Anderson said. \"These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value \u2013 they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.\u201d",
      "For the 27 women who made the AP survey \u2014 the highest number dating back to 2014 \u2014 median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts.",
      "The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.",
      "Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million).",
      "Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we\u2019re really not moving the needle significantly,\u201d she said.",
      "Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023.",
      "Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.",

      "A push in Texas to ban children under 18 years old from social media platforms is fading at the state Capitol",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A push in Texas to ban social media accounts for children under 18 faded Thursday after lawmakers did not take a key vote on creating one of the nation's toughest restrictions aimed at keeping minors off platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.",
      "The bill, which already passed the GOP-controlled state House, aims to go further than a Florida social media ban for minors under 14. Australia banned social media accounts for anyone under 16.",
      "But earlier momentum behind the Texas measure slowed at the eleventh hour in the state Senate as lawmakers face a weekend deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has not said publicly whether he supported the proposed ban, which was opposed by tech trade groups and critics who called it it an unconstitutional limit on free speech.",
      "\u201cThis bill was the best way to protect children in this state,\u201d state Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican carrying the measure, said Wednesday.",
      "The legislative session ends Monday. That leaves a narrowing path for the proposal that, if passed, would set up another test of state efforts to set boundaries on how and when children can access social media.",
      "Many tech companies have established a presence in Texas, including X, which is owned by Elon Musk.",
      "Earlier this week, Abbott signed into law a separate measure requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of online app store users, as well as parental consent to download apps and make in-app purchases for users under 18. Utah passed a similar bill earlier this year.",
      "The proposed Texas ban aimed at minors is the latest move in a growing bipartisan push nationwide to address the impacts of social media on the well-being of children. Critics accuse platforms of using addictive functions to lure children onto their site and keep them there, and of not doing enough to curb violent or age-inappropriate content, or online abuse.",
      "Nearly half of American teenagers say they are online \u201cconstantly\u201d despite concerns about the effects of social media and smartphones on their mental health, according to a December 2024 report published by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The American Psychological Association has called on tech companies and lawmakers to protect children\u2019s mental health, arguing that social media platforms are \u201cparticularly risky\u201d to young people who cannot disengage from sites and struggle with impulse control.",
      "States and countries have passed various measures to address the problem, and some have run into legal challenges.",
      "A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah\u2019s first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "California, which is home to some of the largest tech companies in the world, will make it illegal for social media platforms to knowingly provide addictive feeds to children without parental consent starting in 2027. And New York state allows parents to block their kids from getting social media posts suggested by a platform\u2019s algorithm.",

      "\u201cI think this kind of physical violence is a natural manifestation of the emboldened nature of crypto activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that might clearly be outside of social norms in other spaces \u2014 like robbing a bank \u2014 are somehow just part of the game here.\u201d",
      "In the New York case, two American crypto investors \u2014 John Woeltz and William Duplessie \u2014 have been arrested on kidnapping and assault charges in recent days after a 28-year-old Italian man told police they tortured him for weeks to get his Bitcoin password. Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",
      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records. Police stopped the carjacking and arrested six men.",
      "Meanwhile in France, kidnappings of wealthy cryptocurrency holders and their relatives in ransom plots have spooked the industry.",
      "Attackers recently kidnapped the father of a crypto entrepreneur while he was out walking his dog, and sent videos to the son including one showing the dad's finger being severed as they demanded millions of euros in ransom, prosecutors allege. Police freed the father and arrested several suspects.",
      "Earlier this year, men in masks attempted to drag the daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO and a founder of the Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium, into a van, but were thwarted by a shopkeeper armed with a fire extinguisher.",
      "And in January, the co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were also kidnapped for ransom from their home in the region of Cher of central France. They also were rescued by police and 10 people were arrested.",
      "The FBI recently released its 2024 internet crime report that tallied nearly 860,000 complaints of suspected internet crime and a record $16.6 billion in reported losses \u2014 a 33% increase in losses compared with 2023.",
      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

      "Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human.",
      "The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward.",
      "But Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended \u2013 hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry\u2019s prospects.",
      "Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia\u2019s report for its fiscal first quarter.",
      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",
      "In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter.",
      "In a conference call with analysts, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lamented that the U.S. government had effectively blocked off AI chip sales to China \u2014 a market that he estimated at $50 billion. Huang warned the export controls have spurred China to build more of its own chips in a shift that he predicted the U.S. will eventually regret.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it\u2019s clearly wrong,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Despite Nvidia's lost opportunities in China, investors were heartened by the company's first-quarter performance. Nvidia's shares gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia\u2019s stock price ended Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology\u2019s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company's annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years.",
      "Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia\u2019s chips \u201cThere is one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution and it's Nvidia. That narrative is clear from these results,\u201d Ives wrote in a research note.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off other key markets besides China.",
      "In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia\u2019s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil.",
      "Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will always be Nvidia\u2019s largest market and home to the largest installed base of our infrastructure,\u201d Huang said. \u201cEvery nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution.\u201d",

      "Speaking at a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, Vance urged the crypto executives and enthusiasts to keep pressure on Congress to pass pro-crypto legislation supported by the White House.",
      "\u201cWe have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to unleash innovation and use it to improve the lives of countless American citizens,\u201d Vance said in his address. \u201cBut if we fail to create regulatory clarity now, we risk chasing this $3 trillion industry offshore in search of a friendly jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s speech comes after Trump promised to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d when he addressed the same bitcoin conference in Nashville last year in the middle of the presidential campaign. The crypto industry, which felt unfairly attacked by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump and pro-crypto lawmakers win election.",
      "Vance praised how quickly the crypto industry was able to organize and influence U.S. politics during last year\u2019s election, giving special credit to Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the billionaire founders of the crypto exchange Gemini.",
      "\u201cYou chose to speak up and you chose to get involved and I believe you changed the direct trajectory of our country because of it,\u201d Vance told the crowd gathered at the Venetian Hotel.",
      "Vance hailed crypto as a hedge that can help conservative populists protect themselves against bad politicians, overly aggressive regulators and unethical elites. He predicted its continued assimilation into the financial mainstream and said it was strategically important for the U.S. to be a world leader in the industry, noting that the Chinese government is hostile to crypto.",
      "Vance also touted the Trump administration\u2019s record at fulfilling the campaign promises made last year.",
      "As president, Trump has established a strategic bitcoin reserve for the federal government and pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, a black market website that was key to the early growth of bitcoin. Trump has also staked his administration with outspoken crypto backers while his administration has undone or paused several enforcement actions taken against large crypto companies.",
      "Several other Trump officials are speakers at the bitcoin conference, as are his sons Don Jr. and Eric. The president and his family\u2019s use of crypto as a platform to make money for the Trump brand has drawn criticism from Democrats and even crypto enthusiasts as corrupt and unseemly.",
      "The Trump family holds about a 60% stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that recently launched its own stablecoin, a fast-growing form of cryptocurrency whose values is often tied to the U.S. dollar. The U.S. Senate advanced legislation earlier this month that creates a federal framework to regulate stablecoins, a bill that Vance said the Trump administration wants passed into law quickly.",
      "Trump\u2019s media company announced Tuesday that it was raising $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, the world\u2019s oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. The president and the first lady have also launched their own meme coins, with Trump recently attending a dinner for some of his coins\u2019 biggest investors.",

      "Researchers are still charting how human populations spread across the Americas thousands of years ago, arriving first in North America before veering south. Groups that split off developed their own collection of genes that scientists can use to piece together the human family tree.",
      "Discovered through ancient DNA, the group lived in the high plateaus of present-day Bogot\u00e1, Colombia \u2014 close to where the Americas meet. Scientists aren't sure exactly where they fall in the family tree because they're not closely related to ancient Native Americans in North America and also not linked to ancient or present-day South Americans.",
      "The new study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "\u201cUp to this point, we didn\u2019t believe there was any other lineage that would appear in South America,\" said archaeologist Andre Luiz Campelo dos Santos with Florida Atlantic University who was not involved with the new research. \u201cThis is unexpected.\u201d",

      "Analyzing more genes in South America will help confirm if this new group truly did disappear or if there could be evidence of their descendants elsewhere, said Campelo dos Santos.",

      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it\u2019s shooting out radio waves. What\u2019s more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University\u2019s Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",

      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",

      "SpaceX has launched its Starship mega rocket again after back-to-back explosions",
      "After back-to-back explosions, SpaceX launched its mega rocket Starship again on Tuesday evening, but fell short of the main objectives when the spacecraft tumbled out of control and broke apart.",
      "The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off on its ninth demo from Starbase, SpaceX\u2019s launch site at the southern tip of Texas. Residents voted this month to organize as an official city.",
      "CEO Elon Musk 's SpaceX hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning as it skimmed space toward an uncontrolled landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft experienced \u201ca rapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d or burst apart. \u201cTeams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test,\u201d the company said in an online statement.",
      "Musk noted in a post on X it was a \u201cbig improvement\u201d from the two previous demos, which ended in flaming debris over the Atlantic. Despite the latest setback, he promised a faster launch pace moving forward, with a Starship soaring every three to four weeks for the next three flights.",
      "It was the first time one of Musk's Starships \u2014 intended for moon and Mars travel \u2014 flew with a recycled booster. There were no plans to catch the booster with giant chopsticks back at the launch pad, with the company instead pushing it to its limits. Contact with the booster was lost at one point, and it slammed into the Gulf of Mexico in pieces as the spacecraft continued toward the Indian Ocean.",
      "Then the spacecraft went out of control, apparently due to fuel leaks.",
      "\u201cNot looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,\u201d said SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot. The company had been looking to test the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield during a controlled reentry.",
      "Communication ceased before the spacecraft came down, and SpaceX ended its webcast soon afterward.",
      "The previous two Starships never made it past the Caribbean. The demos earlier this year ended just minutes after liftoff, raining wreckage into the ocean. No injuries or serious damage were reported, although airline travel was disrupted. The Federal Aviation Administration last week cleared Starship for another flight, expanding the hazard area and pushing the liftoff outside peak air travel times.",
      "Besides taking corrective action and making upgrades, SpaceX modified the latest spacecraft\u2019s thermal tiles and installed special catch fittings. This one was meant to sink in the Indian Ocean, but the company wanted to test the add-ons for capturing future versions back at the pad, just like the boosters.",
      "NASA needs SpaceX to make major strides over the next year with Starship \u2014 the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built \u2014 in order to land astronauts back on the moon. Next year\u2019s moonshot with four astronauts will fly around the moon, but will not land. That will happen in 2027 at the earliest and require a Starship to get two astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back off again.",

      "Japan said it plans to use some of the slightly radioactive soil removed from across Fukushima and stored near the wrecked nuclear plant on flower beds outside Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s office to show it is safe to reuse",
      "TOKYO -- Japan said Tuesday it plans to use some slightly radioactive soil stored near the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant on flower beds outside Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s office to show it is safe to reuse.",
      "The soil was removed from across the Fukushima prefecture as part of decontamination work following the 2011 nuclear disaster and has since been in interim storage. Some of it has since reached levels safe enough for reuse, officials say.",
      "Using the soil at Ishiba's office in Tokyo is aimed at reassuring the public it is safe. The government said that it plans to reuse the soil for flower beds and other purposes within the grounds of government agencies. The plan is based on guidelines set by the Environment Ministry in March and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "The Fukushima disaster resulted in large amounts of radioactive materials spewing out from the plant, polluting surrounding areas.",
      "Japan is stuck with large volumes of the dirt, chopped trees and other debris collected during intensive decontamination work. It has 14 million cubic meters of dirt and other materials \u2014 enough to fill 11 baseball stadiums \u2014 stored at a sprawling outdoor facility straddling the towns of Futaba and Okuma, near the Fukushima plant.",
      "The government is aiming to find disposal sites for the soil by 2045, with officials suggesting low risk material could be used to build roads and in other public works projects across the country.",
      "The Environment Ministry said that the soil will be used as foundation material and safely covered with top soil thick enough to keep radiation at negligible levels.",
      "But there is much public unease. The government has already been forced to discontinue a plan to experiment using some of the soil in flower beds at several public parks in and around Tokyo following protests.",
      "The IAEA is providing assistance with the Fukushima decommissioning process, which requires removing more than 880 tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "In 2023 Japan began discharging treated radioactive wastewater from the plant into the sea to reduce the risk of accidental leaks and to make space to build facilities needed for melted fuel removal.",

      "Scientists have pinpointed the oldest known evidence of humans making tools from whale bone",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have pinpointed the oldest known evidence of humans making tools from whale bone.",
      "The bones, fashioned into narrow projectiles for hunting, had been uncovered in excavations dating back over a century in the Bay of Biscay near Spain and France. Scientists figured the tools were quite ancient, but many were small fragments so it was hard to determine their age.",
      "Technological advancements in the past decade have now made it possible to date the oldest of the tools to about 20,000 years ago. Scientists found that the bones came from blue whales, fin whales, sperm whales and other species.",
      "\u201cHumans and whales have clearly been encountering one another for a long time,\u201d said Vicki Szabo with Western Carolina University, who studies the history of whaling and was not involved with the latest research.",
      "Scientists think that ancient humans were crafting whale bone instruments in places including the Arctic and South Pacific. There\u2019s been solid evidence of whale bone tools dating back to about 5,000 years ago, but the new research published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications pushes the timeline back.",
      "Ancient humans weren't necessarily hunting whales, said study author Jean-Marc Petillon with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. More likely, they were scavenging the bodies of beached whales and fashioning their dense, heavy bones into tools to hunt reindeer or bison.",
      "The tools indicate that ancient people in the area took advantage of resources near the sea for survival. They likely also collected seashells and fished. Finding such evidence has been difficult as rising sea levels disrupt coastlines across the globe, scientists said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one more contribution to the importance of coastal environments for human groups, even in this long past,\" said Petillon.",

    "story": [
      "Rising concerns about the misuse of drones have led to the development of new technologies designed to counter unmanned aircraft",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drones have harassed airports and bedeviled local police. They have trespassed over nuclear plants and prisons. On the battlefield, they can kill.",
      "But aside from shooting down the devices, which may create further danger, there's often not much anyone can do to stop drones when they pose a threat or wander where they're not welcome.",
      "That's beginning to change. Cheap and easily modified, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a part of daily life as well as a tool for governments and bad actors alike \u2014 used for intelligence gathering, surveillance, sabotage, terrorism and more. Concerns about their misuse have spurred a technological scramble for ways to stop the devices in midair.",
      "\u201cAn adversary can use an off-the-shelf drone they bought for $500 and find out what\u2019s going on at U.S. nuclear weapons bases,\" said Zachary Kallenborn, a London-based national security consultant and expert on drone warfare. \u201cChina, Russia, Iran: If they're not doing it they're stupid.\u201d",
      "Military drones are already potent weapons of war, used to track enemy movements and deliver attacks. But they have become an increasing threat at home, too. And anti-drone systems now hold significant promise for airports, water treatment plants, military installations and public events targeted by drones in recent years.",
      "The rise in incidents involving unmanned aircraft \u2014 like the wave of sightings reported last year in New Jersey \u2014 has led to more research and investment into the most effective ways of countering drones, preferably while preventing injuries to those below.",
      "Some systems work by firing a projectile to destroy it. Others jam the radio frequencies used to control the drones, causing them to land in place or fly back to their origin. Another approach uses other drones to fire nets at the offending devices.",
      "All the techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.",
      "Jamming a drone is highly effective and relatively easy from a technical standpoint. But it\u2019s a blunt tool \u2014 jamming not just the drone's signal but other electromagnetic signals used by telephones, emergency responders, air traffic control and the internet.",
      "The most basic anti-drone measures are called kinetic defenses, which involve shooting a missile, bullet, net or other projectile at the device to destroy or disable it.",
      "Kinetic systems can be risky, however, by creating the threat that debris could fall on people or property or that a missile fired at unmanned aircraft could miss and hit civilians instead. In 2022, for instance, 12 people were injured in Saudi Arabia when they were hit by debris after authorities took down a drone launched by Houthi rebels near the Yemen border.",
      "The Israeli firm D-Fend Solutions created a system it calls EnforceAir that allows the operator to hack into an adversarial drone and take over its controls. The equipment looks like a large computer router and can be set up on a tripod or a vehicle or carried in a backpack.",
      "Like other anti-drone systems, D-Fend's product also detects any drones entering a predetermined area, allowing the operator to permit friendly devices to fly through while disabling others.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in an empty athletic field in suburban Washington, the system quickly hijacked a drone operated by one of D-Fend's technicians as it entered an area being monitored.",
      "\u201cWe detect the drone, we take control and we land it,\u201d said Jeffrey Starr, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.",
      "Landing the aircraft safely allows authorities to study the device \u2014 a critical benefit to law enforcement or national security investigations. It also allows the drone to be given back to its owner in the case of harmless mistakes involving hobbyists.",
      "Anti-drone systems that involve hacking the invading aircraft may not work on military drones, however, as they come equipped with greater cyberdefenses.",
      "National security experts predict that a variety of techniques to counter drones could soon become commonplace, used to protect sensitive buildings, pipelines, ports and public areas. But before that can happen, federal laws must catch up to the threat.",
      "\u201cMost of the laws we're dealing with were written for manned aviation,\u201d said DJ Smith, senior technical surveillance agent with the Virginia State Police's Bureau of Criminal Investigations.",
      "Smith, who oversees his department\u2019s use of drones, said any new federal rules should come with a public awareness campaign so hobbyists and commercial drone users understand the law and the responsibilities of using a drone. Authorities also need greater powers to use systems to track suspicious drones, he said, and take action against them when they pose a threat.",
      "\u201cWe want to detect, we want to track, we want to identify,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Federal law currently restricts how local and state police can use anti-drone systems. Some lawmakers are pushing to change that.",
      "\u201cIt is paramount that our state and local law enforcement agencies are able to be granted the proper authority to protect citizens at large events and gatherings,\u201d said Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and a sponsor of legislation designed to make it easier for local authorities to use technology to counter drones at large public events.",
      "The bill, introduced this month, would give local law enforcement the ability to use anti-drone systems that have been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.",

The talks came just one day after Ukraine launched an audacious drone attack on Russia's strategic bomber fleet.",
      "Revived talks so far have failed to reach a peace deal, or even achieve a sustained ceasefire, despite pressure on both sides by President Donald Trump's administration. The last meeting between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul in mid-May was the first direct contact between the two sides since spring 2022.",
      "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry confirmed to ABC News on Monday morning that talks resumed at Istanbul's Ciragan Palace, ending just over an hour later. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said the two sides agreed to swap all severely wounded and ill prisoners of war and to exchange the bodies of thousands of fallen soldiers.",
      "They also discussed a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Umerov.",
      "Ukraine is calling for a full 30-day ceasefire during which time peace negotiations can take place. Russia has refused the request, with Putin and his top officials retaining maximalist war goals dating back to the opening days of the Russian invasion.",
      "Vladimir Medinsky, a Putin aide and long-time member of Russia's negotiating team, said Russia has proposed a ceasefire lasting two to three days, on separate sections of the front, to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers.",
      "Among the Kremlin's demands are the annexation of four Ukrainian regions -- plus the retention of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014 -- Ukrainian demilitarization and a permanent block on the country's accession to the NATO.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a Sunday social media post that Kyiv's delegation would be led by Umerov.",
      "The president set out Ukraine's goals for the meeting. \"First -- a full and unconditional ceasefire,\" he wrote. \"Second -- the release of prisoners. Third -- the return of abducted children. And in order to establish a reliable and lasting peace and ensure security, preparation of the meeting at the highest level.\"",
      "Zelenskyy and his government have repeatedly accused Putin of intentionally sabotaging peace talks since Trump returned to office in January, having promised on the campaign trail to end the war within 24 hours. Trump's threat of further sanctions on Russia does not appear to have softened the Kremlin's war goals.",
      "Zelenskyy and his European backers have pushed Trump to increase pressure on Putin by introducing new sanctions on Russia and providing Ukraine with more military support. Keith Kellogg, Trump's Ukraine-Russia envoy, hinted at the president's growing frustration with Moscow, telling ABC News last week that the president has \"seen a level of unreasonableness that really frustrates him.\"",
      "In a phone conversation with Trump in May, Putin said Russia would provide a \"peace memorandum\" outlining a possible settlement. Moscow provided the document on Monday, according to Umerov. Medinsky said Sunday that the Russian team had received Ukraine's version of the peace memorandum.",

      "The talks come a day after Ukraine launched one of the most stunning attacks of the war. In what a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told ABC News was an operation one and a half years in the making, operatives used attack drones concealed in containers carried by trucks to attack strategic bomber bases deep inside Russian territory.",
      "Moscow has used long-range bombers and their cruise missile armaments to attack Ukrainian cities throughout the full-scale invasion. The SBU claimed to have hit more than 40 military aircraft in the attacks, which targeted multiple air bases thousands of miles from Ukrainian-controlled territory. Zelenskyy said that 34% of Russia's cruise missile-carrying aircraft were hit.",
      "Speaking at a summit of the Bucharest Nine and Nordic countries in Lithuania on Monday, Zelenskyy said of Sunday's drone attack, \"Russia must realize what it means to suffer losses. That is what will push it toward diplomacy.\"",
      "\"This is a special moment,\" Zelenskyy added. \"On the one hand, Russia has started its summer offensive. But on the other, it is forced to participate in diplomacy. And this is at once a challenge and also a real opportunity for all of us. It is a chance to end this war.\"",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry framed the operation as \"a terrorist attack,\" claiming that the strikes were \"repelled\" in three regions, but noting that several aircraft caught fire at airfields during the attacks in Irkutsk and Murmansk -- videos of which the SBU published.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a challenge to a state ban on assault weapons, semiautomatic rifles that are popular among gun owners and have also been used in multiple mass shootings.",
      "The justices turned down a case against a Maryland law passed after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults. The shooter was armed with an AR-15, one of the firearms commonly referred to as an assault weapon.",

      "The latest proposal was submitted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Hamas said it has submitted a response to the latest ceasefire proposal by U.S. Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff to mediators on Saturday, reiterating its key demands.",
      "Hamas' key demands are \"to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the continuous flow of humanitarian aid,\" according to the group.",
      "The group's demands remain the same as in previous ceasefire negotiations.",
      "Hamas said its hostage exchange proposal would involve the release of 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Israeli forces have killed at least 60 Palestinians and injured another 284 across the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health said Saturday.",
      "At least 54,381 people in Gaza have been killed and 124,054 have been wounded, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, since the war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage. At least 20 hostages remain in Hamas captivity.",
      "Special Envoy Steve Witkoff stated that he received Hamas's response to the U.S. proposal, describing it as \"completely unacceptable.\" Witkoff insisted that Hamas agree to the U.S. framework proposal before the talks.",
      "\"Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,\" Witkoff said in a post on social media.",
      "\"That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families and in which we can have at the proximity talks substantive negotiations in good-faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire,\" Witkoff said.",
      "The White House said Thursday that it had submitted an Israeli-approved ceasefire proposal to Hamas.",
      "\"I can confirm that Special Envoy Witkoff and the president submitted a cease fire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed and supported. Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "Israel's defense minister warned Hamas to take the deal or be destroyed.",
      "\"The Hamas murderers will now be forced to choose: to accept the terms of the \"Witkoff Deal\" for the release of the hostages - or to be destroyed,\" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Friday.",
      "Katz added, \"The IDF continues its activity in Gaza with full force, striking and dismantling Hamas outposts, while evacuating the local population from every combat zone and attacking the area from the air, land and sea on an unprecedented scale for maximum protection of our soldiers in preparation for the entry of the forces maneuvering in each area and during the maneuver.\"",

    "story": [
      "Both governors have denied any plans of seeking the presidential nomination.",
      "Democratic governors Tim Walz and Wes Moore are fired up - but not solely to eat South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn's so-called \"world famous\" breaded fish.",
      "They're fired up to refocus their party, and on Friday evening, both pitched their theory of how to build up coalitions and win back the Americans they've lost: emphasize the political gravity of the moment forcefully and frequently, and don't wait until the midterms to talk to as many constituencies as possible.",
      "\"Each and every one of us, we're not going to have someone come save us. But who wants that? We can save ourselves. We can get out there. We can make a difference,\" said Minnesota Gov. Walz during brief remarks on stage to a few hundred Democrats in Columbia, South Carolina. \"We need to change the attitude, compete in every district, compete for every school board seat, and come out to this damn fish fry with the attitude: 'we're going to fill up on some fish, and then we are going to beat the hell out of these dictators.'\"",
      "Moore, the first Black governor of Maryland, in his remarks stressed that the \"baton is in our hands.\"",
      "\"We are not going to drop it. We are going to run through the tape, and we are going to win because we understand what's at stake,\" said Moore",
      "He continued the refrain, as a rallying cry of sorts: \"Send a message the entire country is going to hear. This is our time. This is our moment. We will not shirk, we will not flinch, we will not blink. We will win, just as those who came before us did.\"",
      "Yet, neither of them said that they should be the leader of the party in 2028. Both governors have denied any plans of seeking the presidential nomination, which the pair reiterated during a gaggle with reporters before their on-stage remarks Friday. During that gaggle, Clyburn said he saw both Walz and Moore as \"great leaders\" but said they have to decide their own plans.",
      "Walz has said he has no plans for a White House run and is still mulling whether he will run for gubernatorial reelection. When pressed at an appearance at Harvard's Institute of Politics, Walz said he wasn't sure if the party's eventual candidate is clear just yet.",
      "\"I think it's a super talented bench,\" Walz said. \"Do I think the person's out there? No, I'm not sure they're out there yet.\"",
      "Moore has rejected the notion more fiercely, telling ABC's \"The View\" plainly, \"I am not running.\"",
      "He doubled down in the reporter gaggle Friday, \"Anyone who is talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously,\" Moore told reporters. \"The fight is 2025. Right now.\"",
      "Moore also gave a keynote address at the state's key fundraiser, the Blue Palmetto Dinner, just before his Fish Fry appearance, where, according to a circulated copy ahead of his remarks, he said the party must be delivering \"an alternative\" to Trump at this moment.",
      "\"I want to be clear: We can \u2013 and we must \u2013 condemn Donald Trump's reckless actions. But we would also be foolish not to learn from his impatience. Now is the time for us to be impatient too. Let's not just talk about an alternative. Let's not just study an alternative. Let's deliver an alternative,\" Moore's prepared remarks said.",
      "Even still, it's no secret that Clyburn's fish fry has often been fertile waters for would-be Democratic rising stars and Pennsylvania Ave. hopefuls to mix and mingle among powerful party operatives, donors, and key South Carolina early state voters in one night. And while not as much of a crazed scene as the 2019 event, where a menagerie of Dem candidates vied for stage-time as the partiers shimmied shoulder to shoulder, Friday night's event was still high-energy.",
      "Walz will be speaking to Palmetto State Democrats once again Saturday morning. But that doesn't end the Minnesota governor's campaign travel. After his address on Saturday, he's quickly off to California to speak at its Democratic Party's event.",
      "The famous fish fete tees off a weekend of fundraising and party business as the South Carolina Democratic Party convenes for their state convention. Friday night's event also comes as South Carolina's future placement within the party's early voting calendar is in flux.",
      "Last cycle, due to changes made by the Democratic National Committee, South Carolina replaced historically first Iowa as the initial contest. However, Democrats must set a new calendar for 2028.",
      "Which order the state comes in is less important to Clyburn, he said.",
      "\"I never ask for anything more than to keep us in the pre-primary window,\" said Clyburn. \"Whether that be one, two, three, or four, I don't care.\"",

      "A complete revival of the policy faces formidable obstacles, experts said.",
      "President Donald Trump's steepest tariffs fell into legal limbo this week, casting uncertainty over a major swath of the president's signature economic policy.",
      "The Trump administration could ultimately prevail in a court battle over the levies or seek other legal authorities to reimpose some of the tariffs, experts told ABC News, but a complete revival of the policy now faces formidable obstacles.",
      "Two separate federal courts invalidated far-reaching levies on dozens of countries unveiled in a Rose Garden ceremony that Trump had dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The rulings also struck down 30% tariffs imposed on China as well as a baseline 10% levy slapped on nearly all imports, among other measures.",
      "A federal appeals court moved to temporarily reinstate the tariffs on Thursday afternoon, however, keeping the levies in place while judges weigh the underlying legal justification.",
      "Here's what to know about what's next for Trump's tariffs and what happens to the tax revenue already paid, according to experts.",
      "The court rulings this week set off a legal battle over the tariffs that could stretch on for more than a year and make its way to the Supreme Court, experts told ABC News.",
      "The rulings against the levies in two federal courts \u2013 the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. -- centered on Trump's unprecedented invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act as a legal justification for tariffs.",
      "The 1977 law allows the president to stop all transactions with a foreign adversary that poses a threat, including the use of tools like sanctions and trade embargoes. But the measure does not explicitly permit tariffs, putting Trump in untested legal territory.",
      "\"These are momentous actions to reverse a major initiative of the president of the United States,\" Alan Wolff, a former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told ABC News. \"It's a real loss for the White House.\"",
      "The temporary reinstatement of the tariffs allows the policy to continue as the legal fight plays out, but the ruling does not indicate how judges will weigh in on the merits of the case, Wolff added.",
      "\"It doesn't change the circumstances in court all that much,\" Wolff said. \"I'm sure the White House would like this to get straightened out as soon as possible.\"",
      "In a social media post, Trump slammed the judges at the U.S. Court of International Trade and touted the benefits of his tariff policy.",
      "\"Where do these initial three Judges come from? How is it possible for them to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is it purely a hatred of 'TRUMP?' What other reason could it be?\" Trump said.",
      "The three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of International trade included one judge appointed by Ronald Reagan, one judge appointed by Barack Obama and one judge appointed by Trump himself.",
      "Trump added: \"In this case, it is only because of my successful use of Tariffs that many Trillions of Dollars have already begun pouring into the U.S.A. from other Countries, money that, without these Tariffs, we would not be able to get. It is the difference between having a rich, prosperous, and successful United States of America, and quite the opposite.\"",
      "As of Wednesday, U.S. tariffs had generated about $68 billion in revenue so far this year, though only a portion of those funds owes to levies at risk of being struck down, according to a Politico analysis.",
      "The duration of the legal battle may depend on the rulings handed down from the two appeals courts handling each of the Trump administration's challenges, Patrick Childress, a former trade official under President Joe Biden and Trump, told ABC News.",
      "If the two appellate courts handed down opposing decisions, it would raise the likelihood that the case will take over a year and ultimately reach the Supreme Court, Childress said. But, he added, a pair of similar rulings at the appeals court level could fast-track resolution of the case.",

      "If the courts ultimately rule against Trump's tariffs, the White House may explore other legal authorities as a means of reviving some of the levies, experts said.",
      "In some cases, however, the alternative legal statutes would require time-consuming investigations at federal agencies and put limits on the scope of the levies.",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the executive to invoke temporary tariff authority in response to an adverse trade policy taken up by another country.",
      "Trump's tariffs on a wide swath of Chinese goods during his first term relied on Section 301, which Biden invoked in service of tariffs of his own.",
      "The White House may use Section 301 to reimpose tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China over the nations' respective roles in the transport of fentanyl to the U.S., Childress said. But a wide-ranging invocation of Section 301 for tariffs on dozens of countries could pose administrative challenges, since each use of the measure requires a federal investigation of the alleged abuses, he added.",
      "\"It wouldn't be impossible but it would require a lot of investigations,\" Childress said.",
      "The Trump administration is weighing the use of a separate provision of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose country-specific tariffs of up to 15% for 150 days, The Wall Street Journal reported.",
      "The White House could also expand its use of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the executive to impose tariffs on a specific product if the Commerce Department deems foreign production a threat to national security.",
      "Trump already has invoked the measure to slap 25% tariffs on cars, steel and aluminum. Additional sector-specific tariffs may hit pharmaceuticals and semiconductor chips, according to recent comments from Trump.",
      "Importers who have paid the tariffs at issue will receive government refunds if the levies fall victim to legal challenges, experts told ABC News.",
      "\"Companies should get the money back if that's the result -- and it's a lot of money,\" Wolff said.",
      "The federal government will likely slow down the issuance of refunds until the legal cases are resolved, Childress said.",
      "\"Importers who made the payments could be looking at one or even two years until those refunds get paid,\" Childress added.",
      "When seeking a refund, companies will need to provide detailed information about their imports, the date of shipment and where the products entered the U.S.",
      "\"All of that information is necessary to get a refund further down the road,\" Childress said.",

      "United Nations World Food Programme Executive Director Cindy McCain stressed the \"immediate\" need for aid and a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "\"It's a tragedy. And what we need right now is an immediate ceasefire, complete, unfettered access, along with the safe fence roads, every gate open, to feed people and stop this catastrophe from happening. If we don't do that, it's going to be a humanitarian catastrophe, as I've said, like none other,\" McCain said Sunday on \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\"",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began delivering aid this week after an 11-week embargo. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on May 19 that Israel, \"with our American friends,\" was creating a \"system with distribution centers\" that would be \"secured by the IDF, preventing Hamas from reaching the area.\"",
      "GHF has been criticized by the United Nations and other aid groups for its distribution methods. Photos and videos out of Gaza show long lines of Palestinians waiting for aid. The United Nations warns that Gaza is approaching a famine.",
      "According to the Gaza health ministry, 31 people were killed and 200 injured when Israel opened fire on a GHF aid distribution center located in Rafah. In a statement posted to X, the Israel Defense Forces said, \"At this stage, there are no known casualties from IDF gunfire\" within the site. \"The matter is still under investigation.\"",
      "\"They don't have nearly enough access points. They don't have nearly enough food going in. And -- and so the -- the feel of desperation, you can see it in the video, is very -- it's very disheartening,\" McCain said. \"I mean, for all of us that do this, you know, this is what we do. We -- we -- we understand what it takes and we understand the complexity of it. But we also understand the grave humanitarian need that -- that is existing now.\"",
      "Here are more highlights from McCain's interview:",
      "On the UN's interaction with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation",
      "Stephanopoulos: Have you had any coordination at all this week with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation?",
      "McCain: No, I have not personally. I know that there's been some -- some meetings that have taken place around the -- around the -- Europe, particularly on some of the things. But we have -- we've not seen a plan. We've been a part of some of those meetings. Some of them we have not been. But again, we've seen no plan. And, look, we will work with anybody to feed. This is -- this is the kind of thing that, at this level of desperation, we've got to work together on trying to feed people. So -- so it's not about not willing to work with people. We need the access. We need the Israelis to let us in so we can do our job. And we do it -- we are the best at what we do, I might add. And we're the ones -- we -- we can -- we can not only get in, but we can get in at scale, which is what is most important right now.",

      "McCain: Well, you know, I'm not going to -- going to even pretend to understand what's going on with inside the -- the U.S. government at this particular point. I know what I see on the ground, not just in Gaza but around the world. There's places like Sudan, the DRC Congo, other places, South Sudan, et cetera, they're -- they're in just as much trouble as this. We need to get aid in, in Gaza, and we need to get it in now to avoid this catastrophe.",

      "The defense secretary warned Chinese action against Taiwan could be imminent.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reaffirmed in a speech in Singapore on Saturday that the United States will continue to support U.S allies in the Indo-Pacific region against Chinese aggression as he warned that Chinese military action against Taiwan could be \"imminent.\"",
      "Hegseth made his remarks in a speech at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, which is organized by the International Institute for Security Studies and is a high-profile gathering of regional and international security leaders.",
      "His remarks laid out how the Trump administration sees the Indo-Pacific region as a \"priority theater\" and how the U.S. is prepared to stand by allies in a region where China continues to carry out aggressive military actions, particularly against Taiwan and the Philippines.",
      "\"We do not seek conflict with Communist China. We will not instigate nor seek to subjugate or humiliate,\" Hegseth said. \"President Trump and the American people have immense respect for the Chinese people and their civilization, but we will not be pushed out of this critical region. And we will not let our allies and partners be subordinated and intimidated.\"",
      "In recent years China has invested heavily in building up its military and increased its naval and air presence around Taiwan, engaging in almost daily harassment of Taiwan's borders -- raising concerns that it is preparing to retake by force the island nation it considers a breakaway province.",
      "\"Nobody knows what China will ultimately do,\" said Hegseth. \"But they are preparing and we must, therefore, be ready as well. Urgency and vigilance is our only option.\"",
      "\"We are preparing for war, to deter war \u2014 to achieve peace through strength,\" Hegseth added. \"And we look to you \u2014 our allies and partners \u2014 to join us in this important work. Our time is now. The threats we face will not wait. Nor can we.\"",
      "\"To be clear: any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world,\" said Hegseth who stressed that China may be ready to act sooner than the 2027 deadline that China's President Xi Jinping had set for China's military to be prepared for possible action against Taiwan.",
      "\"There is no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent -- we hope not, but it certainly could be,\" said Hegseth.",
      "China has also increased tensions with the Philippines where Chinese military vessels regularly harass Philippine ships operating in the international waters of the South China Sea as it continues to assert its territorial claims in the region.",
      "Relations between the U.S. and China have also soured following Trump's announcement of steep tariffs on Chinese imports that led China to announce reciprocal tariffs. Both sides have since entered into a shaky temporary agreement to lower their tariffs.",
      "In his remarks, Hegseth said the Trump administration was pursuing a \"common sense\" approach to reestablishing deterrence that includes increasing the U.S. military presence in the western Pacific, \"helping allies and partners strengthen their defense capabilities, and by rebuilding our defense industrial bases.\"",
      "Hegseth encouraged Asian countries to follow the example of NATO nations that have made commitments to increase their military spending to 5% of their gross domestic product as the Trump administration has stated that it wants them to take more ownership of their security commitments in Europe.",
      "\"President Trump and I will be counting on you in this room -- our allies and partners -- to be force multipliers of peace alongside the United States,\" Hegseth said. \"We ask \u2014 and indeed, we insist \u2014 that our allies and partners do their part on defense.\"",
      "He added, \"Sometimes, this means having uncomfortable and tough conversations. Partners owe to it to each other to be honest and realistic. This is the essence of a pragmatic, common-sense foreign policy.\"",
      "Hegseth emphasized that the administration's approach does not mean that America's allies will have to go it alone in potential military actions.",
      "\"You will also see that we are -- and will remain -- loyal to our allies and partners. In fact, the only way to ensure lasting alliances and partnerships is to make sure each side does its part,\" he said.",
      "Hegseth added, \"We will stand with you and beside you to deter Chinese aggression,\" said Hegseth.",
      "The forum is sometimes an opportunity for high-level meetings between top U.S. and Chinese defense leaders during times of rising tension. But in an apparent snub, China's defense minister did not attend this year's forum and instead China was represented by a delegation from its National Defense University.",
      "\"We can't account for whether or not China is here or not, but we're glad we are, and we think it makes the region more stable and more peaceful,\" Hegseth told reporters when asked to comment on China's decision.",
      "China's rising aggression in the region has been a major topic of the conference that included an opening address by French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been touring of Southeast Asian nations to stress France's role in the region.",
      "On Friday night, Hegseth sat in the audience as Macron stressed the importance of a new alliance between European and Asian nations to avoid becoming \"collateral victims of decisions made by superpowers\" -- a reference to the United States and China.",
      "Macron cautioned against a loss of credibility for the international-rules based order if it is applied differently by the U.S. with regard to China while it attempts to resolve the war in Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep seized Ukrainian territory as the Trump administration has proposed.",

      "He spoke to reporters after a veterans memorial event in Delaware.",
      "Former President Joe Biden, after delivering first public remarks since his office announced earlier this month that he had been diagnosed with 'aggressive\" prostate cancer, told reporters on Friday that he was feeling \"optimistic\" about his prognosis.",
      "\"Well, the prognosis is good. You know, we're working on everything. It's moving along. So, I feel good,\" Biden said.",
      "He said he had decided on a treatment option, mentioning that he would be taking various medications.",
      "\"The expectation is, we're going to be able to beat this \u2026 it's not in any organ. My bones are strong. It hasn't penetrated so I'm feeling good,\" he added, later saying his family is also optimistic about the diagnosis and said \"one of the leading surgeons in the world\" is working with him.",
      "The announcement from Biden's office said there was \"metastasis to the bone.\"",
      "Asked about the recent controversy over his mental and physical capabilities while in office, Biden joked, with a smile, \"You can see that -- I'm mentally incompetent and I can't walk.\"",
      "And asked about Democrats who say he shouldn't have run again, Biden said, \"Why didn't they run against me then? Because I'd have beaten them.\" He added he has no regrets.",
      "\"There's a lot going on. And I think we're in a really difficult moment, not only in American history, in world history. I think we're one of those inflection points in history where the decisions we make in the next little bit are going to determine what things look like for the next 20 years,\" he added, saying he is proud of his record as president.",
      "On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that former first lady Jill Biden should \"speak up about what she saw in regards to her husband and when she saw it and what she knew,\" accusing her of lying.",
      "Asked about Leavitt's comments, Biden smiled and said, \"I don't know who the press secretary is,\" but afterward said he was joking and that the media would play that straightforwardly.",
      "In his earlier formal remarks at a Memorial Day service in his home state of Delaware, Biden said that American politics have \"become so divided and so bitter,\" but that he sees the military as united.",
      "\"My friends, Memorial Day is about something profound,\" Biden said. \"Our politics have become so divided and so bitter -- all the years that I've been doing this, I never thought we'd get to this point, but we are. Our troops don't wear a uniform that says I'm a Democrat or I'm a Republican; it says I'm an American, I'm an American, that's who I am.\"",
      "Biden also called his time as the commander in chief the greatest honor of his life, and highlighted the 10th anniversary of the passing of his son Beau \u2013 who served in the Delaware Army National Guard and died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015, when he was 46 years old.",
      "\"The greatest honor [of] my life has been, for four years, of being the commander in chief, [of the] United States,\" Biden said, adding a lighthearted aside that if he had come from another state besides Delaware, he doesn't think that would have happened.",
      "\"I know for many of you, Memorial Day, like for us, is deeply personal,\" Biden said solemnly later in his remarks. \"For the Bidens, this day is the 10th anniversary [of] the loss of my son Beau, [who] spent a year in Iraq, and to be honest, it's a hard day.\"",
      "He spoke about Beau joining him at Memorial Day services, about Beau's time in the Delaware Army National Guard and deployment to Iraq, and the time Beau asked his father to pin the bars on his military uniform.",
      "Beau's legacy lives on in his children and grandchildren, like the legacies of the loved ones other attendees lost, Biden said. \"And just like the legacy of all our fallen heroes lives on -- they live on in us, and they live on in the strength and freedom of our nation. That sounds like hyperbole, but it's real. It's literal.\"",
      "\"So everyone, everyone who came here today to grieve with grief in your heart, please know you're not alone. You'll never be alone, and your loved one will never be forgotten. Period,\" Biden said.",
      "He told attendees as well that \"being with all of you, quite frankly, it makes things a little bit easier. It really does. So thank you for allowing me to grieve with you.\"",
      "After his remarks, Biden appeared visibly emotional when other elected officials speaking at the event spoke about Beau Biden, praising who he was and his military service.",
      "Speaking more generally about Memorial Day, Biden told attendees, \"Folks, every year we come together to remember, to remember, to remember the brave women and men who gave their all for this nation, or as Lincoln called it, the last full measure of devotion,\" Biden said.",
      "He added, \"They laid down their lives so we could live our lives in peace, and maybe the most important word with possibilities. And I know, I know I speak for everyone here, and \u2014 when I say, we remember them every single day, not just this day, but every day.\"",
      "The former president spoke forcefully about providing services to veterans, saying that those who served and have passed deserve that honor.",
      "\"So today, let's renew our pledge to honor our heroes. I mean, sincerely renew our pledge to honor our heroes... I get really angry when I hear about, [claims that] veterans are seeking too much. They're not enough!\" Biden said, adding that is why he wrote legislation relating to Gold Star families and others.",
      "Biden's remarks were also his first after the release of the the book \"Original Sin\", written by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, which alleges Biden had physical and mental impairments while president that were covered up by people in his inner circle.",
      "Spokespeople for Biden have said nothing in \"Original Sin\" shows that Biden did not do his job or that there was any cover-up. Biden. In an appearance on ABC's \"The View\" earlier this month, Biden pushed back on a slate of books making claims about his mental acuity, with the former president saying, \"They are wrong. There's nothing to sustain that.\"",

      "\"We need to get past the failures of the media, which were legend as you pointed out, or the political issue of 'were you for Biden or against Biden?'

      "Top WH economic adviser says it's moving forward on tariffs despite setbacks.",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Sunday that he expects President Donald Trump to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week on tariffs.",
      "\"President Trump, we expect, is going to have a wonderful conversation about the trade negotiations this week with President Xi. That's our expectation,\u201d Hassett told anchor George Stephanopoulos on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday.",
      "Currently, China has a 30% tariff level for goods coming into the U.S., which is reduced from the original 145% Trump levied. A 90-day reprieve from the 145% tariffs was given with the intent that the two countries would negotiate a wider trade deal.",
      "Hassett said he was unsure of the exact date the two leaders would plan to speak to each other.",
      "\"I'm not sure, George, because you never know in international relations, but my expectation is that both sides have expressed a willingness to talk. And I'd like to also add that people are talking every day, so [U.S. Trade Representative] Jamieson Greer, his team and President Xi's team in China, they're talking every day trying to move the ball forward on this matter.\"",
      "Trump's tariffs have faced a number of court challenges. An appeals court reinstated Trump's tariffs this week after a Wednesday court order blocked them. The appeals court decision stands for the time being.",
      "The block on the tariffs came after the Court of International Trade decided that the administration's evocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give the president the right to set \"unlimited\" tariffs. The Trump administration argued that the court order may harm their progress in negotiations.",
      "Here are more highlights from Hassett's interview:",
      "Hassett on the legal challenges to tariffs",
      "Stephanopoulos: Are you confident the Supreme Court is going to uphold these tariffs? What happens if they don't?",
      "Hassett: Right. Well, one of the things we've been doing all the way back until 2017, when I used to speak with you on the show last time, George, is that we've studied every possible way that President Trump's tariff agenda could be pursued. And Jamieson Greer, the best trade lawyer in the business, came down and said the IEPA pursuit that we're pursuing is the fastest, and it's the way that's the most legally sound.",
      "And so we're very thrilled. We are very confident that the judges will uphold this law. And so I think that's Plan A. And we're very, very confident that Plan A is all we're ever going to need. But if, for some reason, some judge were to say that it's not a national emergency when more Americans die from fentanyl than have ever died in all American wars combined, that's not an emergency that the president has authority over, if that ludicrous statement is made by a judge somewhere, then we'll have other alternatives that we can pursue as well to make sure that we make America trade fair again.",
      "On possible deals this week",
      "Stephanopoulos: Where are we exactly? When will we see an actual agreement? Will we see any this week?",
      "Hassett: I expected that we were going to probably see one perhaps as early as last week. And I think that one of the things that's happened is that the trade team has been focused 100 percent like a laser beam on the China matter, to make sure that there are no supply disruptions because these licenses are coming a little slower than we would like. And so, we've been focused like a laser beam on that last week, and the presidents, we expect, will discuss the matter this week. Once that thing's resolved, then we're going to take deals into the Oval that Jamieson Greer and Howard Lutnick have negotiated.",
      "Hassett on Trump's 'big, beautiful bill'",
      "Stephanopoulos: Facing numerous challenges to the bill in the Senate right now from both the right and the left, are you confident that the president's deadline is going to be met?",
      "Hassett: Deadlines are deadlines, right? So, the one thing I could say is that we're 100 percent confident that this bill is going to pass because in the end, the senators who are worried about the bill understand that you're going to cast the economy into recession and vote for the biggest tax hike in history if you vote against the bill.",

      "A little less than once a week on average since President Donald Trump began his second term, his administration\u2019s lawyers have filed emergency appeals with the Supreme Court",
      "WASHINGTON -- The sequence of events is familiar: A lower court judge blocks a part of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, an appellate panel refuses to put the order on hold while the case continues and the Justice Department turns to the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump administration lawyers have filed emergency appeals with the nation's highest court a little less than once a week on average since Trump began his second term.",
      "The court is not being asked to render a final decision but rather to set the rules of the road while the case makes it way through the courts.",
      "The justices have issued orders in 11 cases so far, and the Trump administration has won more than it has lost.",
      "Among the administration's victories was an order allowing it to enforce the Republican president's ban of on transgender military service members. Among its losses was a prohibition on using an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans alleged to be gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador.",
      "The most recent emergency filing arrived May 27.",
      "The Trump administration's latest appeal asks the high court to halt an order by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston. The White House violated his earlier order, Murphy found, with a deportation flight bound for the African nation carrying people from other countries who had been convicted of crimes in the U.S.",
      "Those immigrants must get a real chance to raise any fears that being sent there could put them in danger, Murphy wrote.",
      "Trump's top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, asked for an immediate high court order that would allow the third-country deportations to resume.",
      "Murphy has stalled efforts to carry out deportations of migrants who can\u2019t be returned to their home countries, Sauer wrote. Finding countries willing to take them is \u201ca delicate diplomatic endeavor\u201d and the court requirements are a major setback, he said.",
      "Lawyers for the deported men have until Wednesday to respond.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency, overseen by billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk until his departure on Friday, is resisting a lawsuit calling for it to publicly disclose information about its operations.",
      "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington argues in a lawsuit that DOGE, which has been central to Trump\u2019s push to remake the government, is a federal agency and must be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "CREW claims that DOGE \u201cwields shockingly broad power\u201d with no transparency about its actions. The administration says DOGE is just a presidential advisory body that is exempt from FOIA disclosures.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper had found that its role is likely more than just advisory, especially in helping to shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development and cut billions of dollars in government contracts.",
      "The administration appealed Cooper's orders requiring documents be turned over and acting Administrator Amy Gleason to answer questions under oath.",
      "Last week, Chief Justice John Roberts agreed to temporarily pause the orders pending additional word from the Supreme Court.",
      "Social Security has personal data on nearly everyone in the country, including school records, bank details, salary information and medical and mental health records for disability recipients, according to court documents.",
      "The Trump administration says DOGE needs access to Social Security's systems as part of its mission to target waste in the federal government.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in Maryland restricted the team\u2019s access to Social Security under federal privacy laws, saying DOGE's efforts at the agency amounted to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d based on \u201clittle more than suspicion\u201d of fraud.",
      "The judge is disrupting DOGE's work and interfering with decisions that belong to the executive branch, not courts, Sauer wrote in asking the high court to block Hollander's order in the suit filed by labor unions and retirees.",
      "The justices could act anytime.",
      "Several judges quickly blocked an executive order Trump signed his first day in office that would deny citizenship to children who are born to people who are in the country illegally or temporarily.",
      "The administration appealed three court orders that prohibit the changes from taking effect anywhere in the country.",
      "Earlier in May, the justices took the rare step of hearing arguments in an emergency appeal. It's unclear how the case will come out, but the court seemed intent on keeping the changes on hold while looking for a way to scale back nationwide court orders.",
      "One possibility advanced by some justices was to find a different legal mechanism, perhaps a class action, to accomplish essentially the same thing as the nationwide injunctions blocking Trump's citizenship order.",
      "Nationwide injunctions have emerged as an important check on Trump\u2019s efforts to remake the government and a source of mounting frustration to the Republican president and his allies.",
      "Judges have issued 40 nationwide injunctions since Trump began his second term in January, Sauer told the court during the arguments.",
      "The court could act anytime, but almost certainly no later than early summer.",

      "Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into the crowd",
      "BOULDER, Colo. -- Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd. The FBI immediately described the violence as a \u201ctargeted terror attack.\u201d",
      "The suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d during the Sunday attack on the group of demonstrators, said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Denver field office.",
      "Soliman was arrested and taken to the hospital for treatment, but authorities didn\u2019t elaborate on his injuries.",
      "Here is what we know about the attack:",
      "Authorities said the attacker targeted demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run for Their Lives, which organizes run and walk events to call for the immediate release of the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza since they were captured by militants during the incursion into southern Israel that started the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.",
      "The group had gathered at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and students.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war has inflamed global tensions and contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. A week earlier, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot to death in Washington by a man who yelled \u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza\u201d as he was being led away by police.",
      "Police in Boulder evacuated multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear.",
      "The violence occurred four years after 10 people were killed a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.",
      "The people injured in the Pearl Street attack range in age from 52 to 88.",
      "Photos from the scene showed a woman lying on the ground in the fetal position with her hair soaked, and a man helping her and getting water from someone with a water jug.",
      "The injuries authorities found were consistent with reports of people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said, adding that injuries ranged from serious to minor.",
      "Redfearn told reporters Sunday evening that it was too early to discuss a motive but that witnesses were being interviewed.",
      "\u201cIt would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on,\u201d he said.",
      "Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene. No charges were immediately announced, but officials said they expect to hold him \u201cfully accountable.\u201d",
      "Video from the scene showed him shirtless and wearing jeans and holding two clear bottles with a transparent liquid in them while shouting at onlookers.",
      "Another video shows a witness shouting, \u201cHe\u2019s right there. He\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails,\u201d as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect.",
      "FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism, and the Justice Department \u2014 which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations \u2014 decried the attack as a \u201cneedless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,\u201d FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.",

      "An attorney for Harvey Weinstein says he doesn't plan to testify in his New York sex crimes retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein doesn't plan to testify at his New York sex crimes retrial, his lawyer said Sunday. That means jurors soon will get the case against the former movie studio boss who propelled the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct.",
      "The trial will move on to closing arguments Tuesday without testimony from Weinstein, Arthur Aidala said Sunday night. The court handles other cases on Mondays.",
      "It's unclear whether jury deliberations would begin Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday.",
      "It was a fraught decision for Weinstein, who didn\u2019t testify at previous trials in New York and California and was convicted in both. He denies the allegations, and Aidala has said that Weinstein was carefully weighing whether to take the stand this time.",
      "While his California appeal winds on, Weinstein won a new trial in his New York rape and sexual assault case when the state\u2019s highest court overturned his 2020 conviction.",
      "He's charged in New York with raping Jessica Mann in 2013 and forcing oral sex on Miriam Haley and Kaja Sokola, separately, in 2006. Mann was an actor and hairstylist, Haley a production assistant and producer, and Sokola a model who aspired to an acting career.",
      "All three women testified for days at the retrial, giving emotional and graphic accounts of what they say they endured. They said Weinstein suggested he'd help them achieve their show-business dreams, but then maneuvered them into private settings and preyed on them.",
      "His attorneys have argued that anything that happened between him and his accusers was consensual.",
      "In the U.S., defendants in criminal cases aren't obligated to testify, and many decide not to, for various reasons. Among them: the prospect of being questioned by prosecutors.",
      "Weinstein has been watching the New York retrial intently from the defense table, sometimes shaking his head at accusers\u2019 testimony and often leaning over to one or another of his attorneys to convey his thoughts.",
      "Aidala said outside court Thursday that Weinstein thought a lot of holes had been poked in the accusers' accounts, but that he also was pondering whether jurors would feel they needed to hear from him.",
      "The jury has heard from a few other defense witnesses \u2014 one of them via a transcript read by court employees.",
      "That witness, Talita Maia, testified at the 2020 trial but was unavailable this time, so jurors instead got a reading Friday of her earlier testimony. One court stenographer voiced the 2020 attorneys' questions, while another stenographer sat in the witness box and rendered Maia's answers, at times with emphasis.",
      "Maia and Mann were roommates and friends in 2013 but later fell out. According to Maia, Mann never mentioned in those days that Weinstein had hurt her in any way. Both Maia and another witness, Thomas Richards, met up with Mann and Weinstein shortly after Mann has said she was raped.",
      "Both witnesses testified that they saw nothing amiss.",
      "Mann testified earlier this month that she never anyone at the time that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her because she didn't think she'd be believed, and she was scared about how he might react.",
      "Weinstein's defense also brought in former Sokola pal Helga Samuelsen, who has friendly ties to the former producer. Samuelsen testified Thursday that Weinstein visited Sokola once and spent about a half-hour in a bedroom with her in a New York apartment the women briefly shared in 2005; Sokola told jurors no such thing happened.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Sokola, Mann and Haley have given their permission to be identified.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A widely anticipated list of \u201c sanctuary jurisdictions\u201d no longer appears on the Department of Homeland Security's website after receiving widespread criticism for including localities that have actively supported the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies.",
      "The department last week published the list of the jurisdictions. It said each one would receive formal notification the government deemed them uncooperative with federal immigration enforcement and whether they\u2019re believed to be in violation of any federal criminal statutes.",
      "The list was published Thursday on the department\u2019s website but on Sunday there was a \u201cPage Not Found\" error message in its place.",
      "The list was part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to target communities, states and jurisdictions that it says aren\u2019t doing enough to help its immigration enforcement agenda and the promises the president made to deport more than 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal authorization.",
      "The list is being constantly reviewed and can be changed at any time and will be updated regularly, a DHS senior official said.",
      "\u201cDesignation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\u201d the official said in a statement.",

      "The list, which was riddled with misspellings, received pushback from officials in communities spanning from urban to rural and blue to red who said the list doesn\u2019t appear to make sense.",
      "In California, the city of Huntington Beach made the list even though it had filed a lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s immigration sanctuary law and passed a resolution this year declaring the community a \u201cnon-sanctuary city.\u201d",
      "Jim Davel, administrator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, said the inclusion of his community must have been a clerical error. Davel voted for Trump as did 67% of Shawano County.",
      "Davel thinks the administration may have confused the county\u2019s vote in 2021 to become a \u201cSecond Amendment Sanctuary County\u201d that prohibits gun control measures with it being a safe haven for immigrants. He said the county has approved no immigration sanctuary policies.",

      "Tulsa\u2019s new mayor on Sunday proposed a $100 million private trust as part of a reparations plan to give descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre scholarships and housing help",
      "TULSA, Okla. -- Tulsa's new mayor on Sunday proposed a $100 million private trust as part of a reparations plan to give descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre scholarships and housing help in a city-backed bid to make amends for one of the worst racial attacks in U.S. history.",
      "The plan by Mayor Monroe Nichols, the first Black mayor of Oklahoma's second-largest city, would not provide direct cash payments to descendants or the last two centenarian survivors of the attack that killed as many as 300 Black people. He made the announcement at the Greenwood Cultural Center, located in the once-thriving district of North Tulsa that was destroyed by a white mob.",
      "Nichols said he does not use the term reparations, which he calls politically charged, characterizing his sweeping plan instead as a \u201croad to repair.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor 104 years, the Tulsa Race Massacre has been a stain on our city's history,\u201d Nichols said Sunday after receiving a standing ovation from several hundred people. \u201cThe massacre was hidden from history books, only to be followed by the intentional acts of redlining, a highway built to choke off economic vitality and the perpetual underinvestment of local, state and federal governments.",
      "\u201cNow it's time to take the next big steps to restore.\u201d",
      "Nichols said the proposal wouldn't require city council approval, although the council would need to authorize the transfer of any city property to the trust, something he said was highly likely.",
      "The private charitable trust would be created with a goal to secure $105 million in assets, with most of the funding either secured or committed by June 1, 2026. Although details would be developed over the next year by an executive director and a board of managers, the plan calls for the bulk of the funding, $60 million, to go toward improving buildings and revitalizing the city's north side.",
      "\u201cThe Greenwood District at its height was a center of commerce,\u201d Nichols said in a telephone interview. \u201cSo what was lost was not just something from North Tulsa or the Black community. It actually robbed Tulsa of an economic future that would have rivaled anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Nichols' proposal follows an executive order he signed earlier this year recognizing June 1 as Tulsa Race Massacre Observance Day, an official city holiday. Events Sunday in the Greenwood District included a picnic for families, worship services and an evening candlelight vigil.",
      "Nichols also realizes the current national political climate, particularly President Trump's sweeping assault on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, poses challenging political crosswinds.",
      "\u201cThe fact that this lines up with a broader national conversation is a tough environment,\u201d Nichols admitted, \u201cbut it doesn't change the work we have to do.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline Weary, is a granddaughter of massacre survivor John R. Emerson, Sr., who owned a hotel and cab company in Greenwood that were destroyed. She acknowledged the political difficulty of giving cash payments to descendants. But at the same time, she wondered how much of her family's wealth was lost in the violence.",
      "\u201cIf Greenwood was still there, my grandfather would still have his hotel,\u201d said Weary, 65. \u201cIt rightfully was our inheritance, and it was literally taken away.\u201d",
      "Tulsa is not the first U.S. city to explore reparations. The Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, was the first U.S. city to make reparations available to its Black residents for past discrimination, offering qualifying households $25,000 for home repairs, down payments on property, and interest or late penalties on property in the city. The funding for the program came from taxes on the sale of recreational marijuana.",
      "Other communities and organizations that have considered providing reparations range from the state of California to cities including Amherst, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Asheville, North Carolina; and Iowa City, Iowa; religious denominations like the Episcopal Church; and prominent colleges like Georgetown University in Washington.",
      "In Tulsa, there are only two living survivors of the Race Massacre, both of whom are 110 years old: Leslie Benningfield Randle and Viola Fletcher. The women, both of whom were in attendance on Sunday, received direct financial compensation from both a Tulsa-based nonprofit and a New York-based philanthropic organization, but have not received any recompense from the city or state.",
      "Damario Solomon-Simmons, an attorney for the survivors and the founder of the Justice for Greenwood Foundation, said earlier this year that any reparations plan should include direct payments to Randle and Fletcher and a victims' compensation fund for outstanding claims.",
      "A lawsuit filed by Solomon-Simmons on behalf of the survivors was rejected by the Oklahoma Supreme Court last year, dampening racial justice advocates' hopes that the city would ever make financial amends.",

      "Two U.S. senators are warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling on peace while preparing a fresh military offensive against Ukraine",
      "PARIS -- Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine, two senior U.S. senators warned Sunday, arguing that the next two weeks could shape the future of a war that has already smashed cities, displaced millions and redrawn Europe\u2019s security map.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to The Associated Press in Paris after meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and touring neighborhoods shattered by what they called the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began.",
      "In Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 who they say is \u201c100% aligned\u201d with them on the war \u2014 the senators warned the window to prevent a renewed assault is closing.",
      "A sweeping U.S. sanctions bill could be the West\u2019s last chance to choke off the Kremlin\u2019s war economy, they said \u2014 adding that they hope their firsthand findings will shift momentum in Washington and help bring a skeptical President Donald Trump on board.",
      "\"What I learned on this trip was he\u2019s preparing for more war,\u201d Graham said of Putin. Blumenthal called the sanctions proposed in legislation \u201cbone-crushing\u201d and said it would place Russia\u2019s economy \u201con a trade island.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is crunch time for Putin and for the world because Russia is mounting a new offensive,\u201d he said.",
      "At the heart of their push is a bipartisan sanctions bill, backed by nearly the entire U.S. Senate but still facing uncertain odds in Washington. It would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports \u2014 targeting nations like China and India that account for roughly 70% of Russia\u2019s energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort.",
      "Graham called it \u201cthe most draconian bill I\u2019ve ever seen in my life in the Senate.\"",
      "\u201cThe world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.\u201d",
      "With peace talks yielding little and Trump's approach to Ukraine highly uncertain, Graham and Blumenthal have stepped into the breach \u2014 blunt emissaries on a lonely mission. Political opposites moving in lockstep, they\u2019re crossing Europe, and the aisle, with the moral urgency of two men trying to forestall another Russian offensive before it\u2019s too late.",
      "Peace talks are scheduled to resume Monday in Istanbul. But Ukrainian officials say Moscow has yet to submit a serious proposal \u2014 a delay both senators described as deliberate and dangerous.",
      "\u201cPutin is playing President Trump,\" Blumenthal said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking him for a sucker.\u201d The senator said Putin \"is, in effect, stalling and stonewalling, prolonging the conversation so that he can mount this offensive and take control of more territory on the ground.\u201d",
      "Graham added: \u201cWe saw credible evidence of a summer or early fall invasion, a new offensive by Putin. ... He\u2019s preparing for more war.\u201d",
      "Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill, telling reporters Friday: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to see it.\u201d Graham said the legislation was drafted in consultation with Trump\u2019s advisers.",
      "Graham backed the president\u2019s diplomatic instincts but said, \"By trying to engage Putin \u2014 by being friendly and enticing \u2014 it\u2019s become painfully clear he\u2019s not interested in ending this war.\u201d",
      "Blumenthal hoped the bipartisan support for Ukraine at least in the Senate \u2014 and the personal testimonies they plan to bring home to Congress and the Oval Office\u2014 may help shift the conversation.",
      "\u201cHe needs to see and hear that message as well from us, from the American people,\u201d he said of Putin.",
      "In Kyiv, the senators said, the war\u2019s human toll was impossible to ignore. Graham pointed to what Ukrainian officials and Yale researchers estimate are nearly 20,000 children forcibly deported to Russia \u2014 calling their return a matter of justice, not diplomacy.",
      "Blumenthal described standing at mass grave sites in Bucha, where civilians were executed with shots to the head. The destruction, he said, and the stories of those who survived, made clear the stakes of delay. \u201cPutin is a thug. He\u2019s a murderer.\"",
      "Both said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later. If Putin isn\u2019t stopped in Ukraine, Blumenthal said, NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle.",
      "After a one-hour meeting with Macron in Paris, both Graham, of South Carolina, and Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said they left convinced Europe was ready to toughen its stance.",
      "\u201cThis visit has been a breakthrough moment because President Macron has shown moral clarity in his conversations with us,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cToday, he is 100% aligned with that message that we are taking back to Washington.\u201d",
      "Blumenthal pointed to the rare bipartisan unity behind the sanctions bill. \u201cThere are very few causes that will take 41 Republicans and 41 Democrats and put them on record on a single piece of legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cause of Ukraine is doing it.\u201d",
      "Ahead, Ukrainian military leaders are set to brief Congress and a sanctions vote could follow.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump said we\u2019ll know in two weeks whether he\u2019s being strung along,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThere will be more evidence of that from Russia on Monday.\u201d",

      "The Gothic university chapel was built in 1928. At the time, Princeton says, its capacity to seat more than 2,000 people was second in size only to King\u2019s College Chapel at Cambridge University.",
      "Today, the chapel hosts interfaith services, concerts and weddings throughout the academic year and is known by the university as \u201cthe bridge between town and gown.\u201d",
      "On May 8, Catholic students were worshipping as usual at daily Mass in the side chapel when the service was interrupted by news alerts on their phones. In the Vatican, white smoke billowed from the Sistine Chapel, indicating that a new leader of their faith had been elected.",
      "The Rev. Zachary Swantek, Princeton\u2019s Catholic chaplain, told the group to gather at the Catholic Ministry office. Together, they watched on TV as the election of the first U.S.-born pope was announced.",

      "Like other members of the Catholic ministry, he is hopeful that Pope Leo XIV will help bring a revival for Catholicism in America.",
      "\u201cI feel that there\u2019s a resurgence of Catholicism today,\u201d said Nelson, who was religiously unaffiliated until last year when he converted to Catholicism. \u201cYou see people who are passionate about their faith. There\u2019s a new wave coming, and we\u2019re going to have more converts like me, who are coming from the 'nones.\u2019\u201d",
      "Across much of the world, the number of people who are nonbelievers or unaffiliated with any organized religion has dramatically increased over the years. The people known as \u201cnones\u201d \u2014 atheists, agnostics, or nothing in particular \u2014 comprise 30% or more of the adult population in the U.S., according to a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Princeton\u2019s Office of Religious Life says it supports members of the school community \u201cof any religious identity or of none.\u201d",
      "Being a devoted Catholic on a mostly secular campus can be challenging; Swantek says he\u2019s never felt \u201cmore needed as a priest.\u201d",

      "\u201cSomething that did bring me a lot of hope is Pope Leo has a missionary background,\u201d said Ace Acuna, a Princeton alumni. He recently attended a Mass at the chapel before beginning a nearly five-week Catholic pilgrimage from Indianapolis to Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cIn a world where in some places it might look like faith is on the decline, a church that\u2019s willing to go out to the margins and evangelize and be on mission, that\u2019s going to be so important,\u201d Acuna said.",
      "When he was an undergrad at Princeton, Acuna said the chapel became crucial to his college life.",

      "President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won\u2019t bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won't bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package.",
      "The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised.",
      "\u201cAll of this rhetoric about cutting trillions of dollars of spending has come to nothing \u2014 and the tax bill codifies that,\u201d said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \u201cThere is a level of concern about the competence of Congress and this administration and that makes adding a whole bunch of money to the deficit riskier.\u201d",
      "The White House has viciously lashed out at anyone who has voiced concern about the debt snowballing under Trump, even though it did exactly that in his first term after his 2017 tax cuts.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt opened her briefing Thursday by saying she wanted \u201cto debunk some false claims\" about his tax cuts.",
      "Leavitt said that the \"blatantly wrong claim that the \u2018One, Big, Beautiful Bill\u2019 increases the deficit is based on the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers who use shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.\u201d",
      "But Trump himself has suggested that the lack of sufficient spending cuts to offset his tax reductions came out of the need to hold the Republican congressional coalition together.",
      "\u201cWe have to get a lot of votes,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cWe can\u2019t be cutting.\u201d",
      "That has left the administration betting on the hope that economic growth can do the trick, a belief that few outside of Trump's orbit think is viable.",
      "Tech billionaire Musk, who was until recently part of Trump's inner sanctum as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, told CBS News: \u201cI was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.\"",
      "The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add more than $5 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if all of them are allowed to continue, according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.",
      "To make the bill's price tag appear lower, various parts of the legislation are set to expire. This same tactic was used with Trump's 2017 tax cuts and it set up this year's dilemma, in which many of the tax cuts in that earlier package will sunset next year unless Congress renews them.",
      "But the debt is a much bigger problem now than it was eight years ago. Investors are demanding the government pay a higher premium to keep borrowing as the total debt has crossed $36.1 trillion. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury Note is around 4.5%, up dramatically from the roughly 2.5% rate being charged when the 2017 tax cuts became law.",
      "The White House Council of Economic Advisers argues that its policies will unleash so much rapid growth that the annual budget deficits will shrink in size relative to the overall economy, putting the U.S. government on a fiscally sustainable path.",
      "The council argues the economy would expand over the next four years at an annual average of about 3.2%, instead of the Congressional Budget Office's expected 1.9%, and as many as 7.4 million jobs would be created or saved.",
      "Council chair Stephen Miran told reporters that when that growth is coupled with expected revenues from tariffs, the expected budget deficits will fall. The tax cuts will increase the supply of money for investment, the supply of workers and the supply of domestically produced goods \u2014 all of which, by Miran\u2019s logic, would cause faster growth without creating new inflationary pressures.",
      "\u201cI do want to assure everyone that the deficit is a very significant concern for this administration,\u201d Miran told reporters recently.",
      "White House budget director Russell Vought told reporters the idea that the bill is \u201cin any way harmful to debt and deficits is fundamentally untrue.\u201d",
      "Most outside economists expect additional debt would keep interest rates higher and slow overall economic growth as the cost of borrowing for homes, cars, businesses and even college educations would increase.",
      "\u201cThis just adds to the problem future policymakers are going to face,\u201d said Brendan Duke, a former Biden administration aide now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Duke said that with the tax cuts in the bill set to expire in 2028, lawmakers would be \u201cdealing with Social Security, Medicare and expiring tax cuts at the same time.\u201d",
      "Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said the growth projections from Trump's economic team are \u201ca work of fiction.\u201d He said the bill would lead some workers to choose to work fewer hours in order to qualify for Medicaid.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of any serious forecaster that has meaningfully raised their growth forecast because of this legislation,\u201d said Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the Council of Economic Advisers chair under the Obama administration. \u201cThese are mostly not growth- and competitiveness-oriented tax cuts. And, in fact, the higher long-term interest rates will go the other way and hurt growth.\u201d",
      "The White House's inability so far to calm deficit concerns is stirring up political blowback for Trump as the tax and spending cuts approved by the House now move to the Senate. Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky have both expressed concerns about the likely deficit increases, with Johnson saying there are enough senators to stall the bill until deficits are addressed.",
      "\u201cI think we have enough to stop the process until the president gets serious about the spending reduction and reducing the deficit,\u201d Johnson said on CNN.",
      "The White House is also banking that tariff revenues will help cover the additional deficits, even though recent court rulings cast doubt on the legitimacy of Trump declaring an economic emergency to impose sweeping taxes on imports.",
      "When Trump announced his near-universal tariffs in April, he specifically said his policies would generate enough new revenues to start paying down the national debt. His comments dovetailed with remarks by aides, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, that yearly budget deficits could be more than halved.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our turn to prosper and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it\u2019ll all happen very quickly,\u201d Trump said two months ago as he talked up his import taxes and encouraged lawmakers to pass the separate tax and spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is correct that growth can help reduce deficit pressures, but it's not enough on its own to accomplish the task, according to new research by economists Douglas Elmendorf, Glenn Hubbard and Zachary Liscow.",
      "Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said additional \u201cgrowth doesn't even get us close to where we need to be.\u201d",
      "The government would need $10 trillion of deficit reduction over the next 10 years just to stabilize the debt, Tedeschi said. And even though the White House says the tax cuts would add to growth, most of the cost goes to preserve existing tax breaks, so that's unlikely to boost the economy meaningfully.",
      "\u201cIt's treading water,\u201d Tedeschi said.",

      "The Trump administration is sending three Cabinet members to Alaska this week as it pursues oil drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reinvigorating a natural gas project that\u2019s languished for years",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Trump administration is sending three Cabinet members to Alaska this week as it pursues oil drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reinvigorating a natural gas project that\u2019s languished for years.",
      "The visit by Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska. It also comes amid tariff talks with Asian countries that are seen as possible leverage for the administration to secure investments in the proposed Alaska liquefied natural gas project.",
      "Their itinerary includes a meeting Sunday with resource development groups and U.S. Sens. Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski in Anchorage before heading to Utqiagvik, an Arctic town on the petroleum-rich North Slope where many Alaska Native leaders see oil development as economically vital to the region.",
      "The federal officials also plan to visit the Prudhoe Bay oil field Monday \u2014 near the coast of the Arctic Ocean and more than 850 miles (1,368 kilometers) north of Anchorage \u2014 and speak at Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",
      "While it's not unusual for U.S. officials to visit Alaska during warmer weather months, Dunleavy's office said the officials' visit is significant. Dunleavy, a Trump ally, said he is thankful for an administration that \u201crecognizes Alaska's unique value.\u201d",
      "Government and industry representatives from a number of Asian countries, including Japan, are expected to participate in a portion of the trip, reflecting pressure from the U.S. to invest in the pipeline \u2014 despite skepticism and opposition from environmental groups.",
      "In Alaska, some environmentalists criticized the agenda for Dunleavy's conference. Highlighting fossil fuels alongside renewable or alternative energy make \u201cenergy sources of the past look more legitimate at a conference like this,\" said Andy Moderow, senior policy director with the Alaska Wilderness League.",
      "\u201cI think we should be looking at climate solutions that work for Alaskans, not trying to open up places that industry is taking a pass on, namely the Arctic refuge,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has long taken credit for provisions of a 2017 tax law championed by Alaska's congressional delegation that called for two oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain by late 2024. The first one remains the subject of ongoing litigation, with the main bidder a state corporation that saw its seven leases later canceled by then-President Joe Biden's administration. A judge in March ruled Biden's administration overstepped, and the Interior Department, in line with Trump's executive order, is working to reinstate the leases.",
      "There weren't any bids in the second sale, held under Biden and blasted by the state as overly restrictive.",
      "Debate over drilling in the refuge \u2014 home to polar bears, musk ox, birds and other wildlife \u2014 has long been a flashpoint. Indigenous Gwich\u2019in leaders consider the coastal plain sacred land, noting its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon.",
      "Many North Slope I\u00f1upiat leaders who support drilling in the refuge felt their voices were not heard during the Biden era. During the Trump officials' visit, they also hope to make a case for additional development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which Trump has advocated, and for being included in planning decisions.",
      "Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat, an advocacy group whose members include leaders from the region, called the officials' visit \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d",
      "For years, the state has sought to develop its stores of North Slope natural gas as a way to provide affordable energy to more residents and bolster revenues via exports. But cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition from other projects and questions about economic feasibility have stymied progress. Oil companies have long reinjected gas that occurs with oil deposits on the slope to produce more oil, which remains Alaska's economic lifeblood.",
      "The latest gas proposal calls for a roughly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would carry gas from the North Slope to port and a facility that would process and export liquefied natural gas to Asian countries. In a March speech to Congress, Trump touted his ongoing support of the \u201cgigantic natural gas pipeline.\" He said countries like Japan and South Korea \u201cwant to be our partner, with investments of trillions of dollars each.\u201d No firm commitments from countries have been made.",
      "The company advancing the project \u2014 in partnership with a state corporation \u2014 is in a stage of refining cost estimates, previously pegged at around $44 billion for the pipeline and related infrastructure, before final decisions are made on whether to move forward with the project.",
      "While Dunleavy has likened Trump\u2019s friendly approach to energy development as \u201cChristmas every day,\u201d Alaska's fortunes remain tightly linked to the volatility of oil prices, which are down sharply from a year ago, squeezing state revenues.",
      "State lawmakers across party lines overwhelmingly passed a resolution urging Congress to provide Alaska with 90% of royalty revenues for oil and gas leases in the Arctic refuge, arguing the U.S. government reneged on past promises for such a share. The resolution also asked for that to be extended to the petroleum reserve.",
      "Alaska\u2019s tax structure allows companies like ConocoPhillips Alaska \u2014 which is pursuing a massive oil project known as Willow in the reserve \u2014 to write off a portion of their development costs against production taxes they incur elsewhere on the North Slope. While lawmakers widely support Willow, they also have argued a change in federal royalty share would address a hit to state revenues created by production in the reserve.",

      "Pride Month, a global celebration of LGBTQ+ people, is starting this weekend in many places",
      "Pride Month kicks off with events around the world starting this weekend.",
      "It's an annual series of parades and other gatherings to celebrate LGBTQ+ culture and rights.",
      "At its heart, Pride is both a party and a protest.",
      "In the U.S. this year, that means speaking out against a slew of policies that impose restrictions on transgender people and that try to end diversity, equity and inclusion programming in government, education and businesses.",
      "Here's a look at the event's roots and this year's events and themes.",
      "The monthlong global celebration began with Gay Pride Week in late June 1970, a year after the violent police raid at New York\u2019s Stonewall Inn, a gay bar.",
      "At a time when many LGBTQ+ people kept their identities private, the June 28, 1969, raid sparked a series of public protests and catalyzed the gay rights movement.",
      "The first pride week featured marches in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, and it has since grown to other cities. On the calendar are events in Philadelphia this weekend; New Orleans on June 14; Chicago on June 21 and 22; and New York over the weekend of June 28 and 29. Many other events in big cities and small towns are also planned.",
      "There are pride celebrations around the world, including in Tokyo on June 8; Toronto on June 27-29; Sao Paolo on June 22; and Paris on June 28.",
      "Some events fall outside of June, too. World Pride, a biannual event held this year in Washington, D.C., began in May and goes through June 8. Pride in London is in July; a big celebration in Rio de Janeiro is in November and Atlanta's is in October.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton proclaimed June as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month in 1999, marking the first time a U.S. president did so.",
      "When President Donald Trump returned to office in January, he quickly attempted to roll back LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "He\u2019s especially targeted transgender people with policies that halted allowing people to change the sex listed on their passport, removed transgender military troops and sought to stop using federal insurance programs to pay for gender-affirming care for transgender people under age 19, and keep transgender athletes out of girls and women's sports competitions.",
      "All of those changes are being challenged in court.",
      "His actions follow years of policies in Republican-controlled states that bar gender-affirming care for transgender minors and dictate which sports transgender people can play and which school and other public bathrooms they are allowed to use. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on whether Tennessee's ban on medical treatment is constitutional.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s orders called for removing references to what he and some other conservatives call \u201cgender ideology\u201d from government publications and websites.",
      "A result of that: References to transgender people have been removed from government websites, including the one for the Stonewall National Monument, site of the event that inspired Pride.",
      "About half of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling transgender issues, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found last month. About 4 in 10 voters approve of his job as president overall.",
      "But support for his individual policies on transgender people is not uniformly strong, with a clearer consensus against policies that affect youth.",
      "Organizers of Milwaukee's PrideFest are prepared for close to 50,000 people at the event scheduled for June 5-7.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re feeling that people will be showing up, and that\u2019s their protest,\u201d said Wes Shaver, the president and CEO of Milwaukee Pride, Inc.",
      "The event's theme is \u201cCelebrating the Power of Pride\u201d and for the first time, one of the entertainment stages one night will feature only transgender performers. Shaver said that's an intentional move in response to Trump's policies. Another night, the stage will feature only performers of color.",
      "Jeremy Williams, the executive producer of Philly Pride 365 in Philadelphia, said he didn't expect more protest than in the past there.",
      "\u201cEverybody's just there to be together,\u201d he said.",
      "One milestone that's likely to be celebrated: This month marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which recognized same-sex marriage nationwide. It was a watershed event in establishing rights for LGBTQ+ people across the country.",
      "About two-thirds of LGBTQ+ adults in the U.S. said the case made the nation more accepting of same-sex couples, according to a Pew Research Center poll released last week.",
      "The poll found that LGBTQ+ people don't always feel accepted, though. About 6 in 10 said they see \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d of social acceptance for those who are lesbian, gay or bisexual. But only about 1 in 10 said the same is true for nonbinary and transgender people.",
      "Several big companies have pulled back on sponsorships for Pride events this year.",
      "Among them: Anheuser-Busch, the St. Louis-based brewer, declined to sponsor PrideFest in its home city after three decades of support, leaving organizers $150,000 short of last year's budget, they told The Associated Press.",
      "NYC Pride said about 20% of its corporate sponsors dropped or reduced support, including PepsiCo and Nissan. The carmaker said it was reviewing all its marketing costs.",
      "In other cities, such as Kansas City, Missouri, pride events lost about half their budgets.",
      "Several companies that have pulled back have not explained why to the AP. But some experts see the change as part of a broader retreat from brand activism.",
      "Still, the groups behind many Pride events say some companies have kept contributing but have asked not to be listed publicly as sponsors.",

      "CLOVIS, Calif. -- California\u2019s high school track-and-field state finals will award one extra medal Saturday in events where a transgender athlete places in the top three, a rule change that may be the first of its kind nationally by a high school sports governing body.",
      "The new California Interscholastic Federation policy was written in response to the success of high school junior AB Hernandez, a trans student who competes in the girls high jump, long jump and triple jump. She led in all three events after preliminaries Friday. The CIF said earlier this week it would let an additional student compete and medal in the events where Hernandez qualified.",
      "The two-day championship kicked off in the sweltering heat at high school near Fresno. The atmosphere was relatively quiet Friday despite critics \u2014 including parents, conservative activists and President Donald Trump \u2014 calling for Hernandez to be barred from girls competition leading up to the meet.",
      "There was some pushback Friday. A group of fewer than 10 people gathered outside the stadium ahead of the meet to protest Hernandez's participation. Some of them wore \u201cSave Girls\u2019 Sports\u201d T-shirts. At one point as Hernandez was attempting a high jump, someone in the stands yelled an insult. An aircraft circled above the stadium for more than an hour during the events, carrying a banner that read, \u201cNo Boys in Girls\u2019 Sports!\u201d",
      "The rest of the night ran smoothly for Hernandez, who finished the triple jump with a mark close to 41 feet (13 meters), nearly 10 inches (25 centimeters) ahead of her closest competitor, San Francisco Bay Area junior Kira Gant Hatcher.",
      "Hernandez also led in the long jump with a mark close to 20 feet (6 meters) to advance to the final. She advanced in the high jump, clearing 5 feet, 5 inches (1.7 meters) with ease.",
      "She did not address the press.",
      "The CIF rule change reflects efforts to find a middle ground in the debate over trans girls\u2019 participation in youth sports.",
      "\u201cThe CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law,\u201d the group said in a statement after announcing its rule change.",
      "A recent AP-NORC poll found that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults think transgender female athletes should not be allowed to participate in girls and women\u2019s sports at the high school, college or professional level. That view was shared by about 9 in 10 Republicans and roughly half of Democrats.",
      "The federation announced the rule change after Trump threatened this week to pull federal funding from California unless it bars trans female athletes from competing on girls teams. The CIF said it decided on the change before then.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice also said it would investigate the state federation and the district that includes Hernandez\u2019s high school to determine whether they violated federal sex discrimination law by allowing trans girls to compete in girls sports.",
      "Some California Republicans also weighed in, with several state lawmakers attending a news conference to criticize the federation for keeping Hernandez in the competition and a Republican gubernatorial candidate planning to attend Saturday's finals.",
      "California law allows trans students to compete on sex-segregated sports teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "The federation said the rule would open the field to more \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes. One expert said the change may itself be discriminatory because it creates an extra spot for \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes but not for other trans athletes.",
      "The federation did not specify how they define \u201cbiological female\u201d or how they would verify whether a competitor meets that definition.",
      "Hernandez told the publication Capital & Main earlier this month that she couldn\u2019t worry about critics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still a child, you\u2019re an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,\u201d she said.",
      "California\u2019s state championship stands out from that of other states because of the number of competitors athletes are up against to qualify. The state had the second-largest number of students participating in outdoor track and field in the nation during the 2023-2024 school year, behind Texas, according to a survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations.",
      "Olympians Marion Jones and Tara Davis-Woodhall previously set state championship records in the long jump in 1993 and 2017, respectively, both surpassing 22 feet (6.7 meters).",
      "The boys 100-meter dash heats were also a highlight Friday. Junior Jaden Jefferson of De La Salle High School in Concord finished in 10.01 seconds, about .2 seconds faster than a meet record set in 2023. Jefferson's time won't count as a record unless he can replicate his results in the final.",

      "After years of sponsoring LGBTQ+ Pride events around the country, some companies are pulling their financial support",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Many U.S. corporations this year stopped supporting Pride events that celebrate LGBTQ+ culture and rights, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in budget shortfalls ahead of the summer festivities and raising questions about corporate America\u2019s commitment to the cause.",
      "The moves come as President Donald Trump has shown antipathy for trans protections and has attempted to roll back some LGBTQ+ friendly federal policies. Experts also note that a growing slice of the public has grown tired of companies taking a stance on social and political issues.",
      "San Francisco Pride, the nonprofit that produces one of the country\u2019s largest and best-known LGBTQ+ celebrations, is facing a $200,000 budget gap after corporate donors dropped out. In Kansas City, Missouri, KC Pride lost about $200,000 \u2014 roughly half its annual budget.",
      "Heritage of Pride, the umbrella organization behind NYC Pride and other LGBTQ+ events in New York City, is fundraising to narrow a $750,000 budget gap after companies withdrew.",
      "Meanwhile, Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch ended its sponsorship of PrideFest in St. Louis, Missouri, its home base, after 30 years, leaving organizers with a $150,000 budget shortfall.",
      "In response, many Pride organizations have canceled some dance parties, reduced the number of stages, hired less pricey headliners and no longer give volunteers free food or T-shirts.",
      "But the core celebrations will go on. In San Francisco, this year\u2019s Pride theme is \u201cQueer Joy is Resistance.\u201d In New York, it's \u201cRise Up: Pride in Protest,\u201d and, in Boston, it's \u201cHere to Stay!\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you come to Pride this year, that\u2019s a revolutionary act,\u201d said Suzanne Ford, executive director of San Francisco Pride. \u201cYou are sending a message to those in Washington that, here in San Francisco, we still have the same values that we\u2019ve always had \u2014 you can love who you love here. We\u2019re not going to retreat from that.\u201d",
      "Following media coverage of their retreat, some companies changed course but asked that their names not be affiliated with the events, the event organizers said.",
      "San Francisco Pride earlier this year lost the support of five major corporate donors, including Comcast, Anheuser-Busch and Diageo, the beverage giant that makes Guinness beer and Smirnoff vodka.",
      "\u201cWith everything we\u2019re facing from the Trump administration, to lose five of your partners within a couple of weeks, it felt like we were being abandoned,\u201d Ford said.",
      "After the withdrawals drew attention, some corporations said they would donate but only anonymously, Ford said, declining to identify those companies. As of this week, neither Comcast, Anheuser-Busch nor Diageo appeared on the organization\u2019s website as sponsors of the June 29 festivities. It was unclear if they donated.",
      "Anheuser-Busch and Diageo didn\u2019t reply to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment. A spokesperson for Comcast also declined to comment but said some of its companies are sponsoring Silicon Valley Pride and Oakland Pride.",
      "NYC Pride spokesperson Chris Piedmont said about 20% of its corporate sponsors either dropped their support or scaled back, including New York-based PepsiCo and Nissan.",
      "Kyle Bazemore, Nissan North America's director of corporate communications, said the decision comes as the automaker reviews all of its marketing expenses to lower costs. PepsiCo did not return an email seeking comment.",
      "Piedmont said NYC Pride has also received anonymous corporate funding and that he appreciates the unpublicized support.",
      "\u201cWriting a check to a nonprofit and supporting a nonprofit with no strings attached is stepping up to the plate,\u201d Piedmont said.",
      "The shift reflects how corporations are adjusting to a changing cultural landscape that began during the pandemic and accelerated with Trump's second term, experts said.",
      "\u201cCompanies are resourceful, they are clever at identifying trends and studying their environment and their customers\u2019 needs, but those needs change and corporations adjust,\u201d said Amir Grinstein, a marketing professor at Northeastern University.",
      "Corporations' presence in rainbow-filled Pride parades, concerts and dance parties became more ubiquitous after the landmark 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, as companies splashed their names on parade floats, rainbow flags and bright plastic bracelets.",
      "So-called brand activism reached its peak between 2016 to 2022, a period of social upheaval around the pandemic, police brutality and transgender rights, Grinstein said.",
      "But research has since found a growing number of American consumers don't want companies taking positions on such topics, said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.",
      "\u201cThere have always been people who said, \u2018I don\u2019t want my toothpaste to have an opinion, I just want to use my toothpaste,\u2019 but the tide has shifted, and research shows there are more people that feel that way now,\" Kahn said.",
      "Meanwhile, Republican-led states have been passing legislation to curtail diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and LGBTQ+ rights, especially the ability of transgender young people to participate in sports or receive gender-affirming care.",
      "Trump signed executive orders on his first day in office that rolled back protections for transgender people and terminated federal DEI programs.",
      "Some companies followed suit by eliminating their DEI goals, prompting Pride organizations to sever ties.",
      "San Francisco's organizers cut ties with Meta after the parent company of Facebook and Instagram terminated its DEI goals and content moderation policies.",
      "Twin Cities Pride ended its relationship with Target over the Minneapolis-based retailer's curtailing of its DEI initiatives following a backlash from conservatives and the White House. The company's retreat from DEI policies led to a counter-boycott by civil rights advocates.",
      "Target announced in May that sales fell more than expected in the first quarter due to customer boycotts, tariffs and other economic factors. The company now offers only some Pride products at a few stores and online.",
      "Still, Rick Gomez, Target's chief commercial officer, told reporters in May that it's important to celebrate Heritage Months, which highlight different groups from Latinos to Asian Americans to the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "\"They drive sales growth for us,\u201d he said.",
      "First-time donations from individuals, foundations and local businesses have increased following corporate America's retreat.",
      "In Minneapolis, a crowdfunding campaign by Twin Cities Pride to fill a $50,000 funding gap raised more than $89,000.",
      "In San Francisco, two local foundations donated $55,000 combined.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first year that there\u2019s been an inflammatory climate around Pride,\u201d said James Moran, a spokesperson for KC Pride, in Kansas City, Missouri. \u201cWe know that our community is looking for spaces that are meant for us, where we can celebrate but also process what\u2019s going on and build our own support networks.\u201d",

      "The third week of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial featured testimony from the second of three women expected to testify that the hip-hop mogul sexually abused them",
      "NEW YORK -- Some of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2019 ex-employees took a central role in the third week of his sex trafficking trial, including personal assistants who testified that the hip-hop mogul was capricious, controlling and violent.",
      "The week began with Capricorn Clark, a personal assistant who was later a global brand director for Combs\u2019 company. She recalled witnessing Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, and said he raged about wanting to kill rapper and romantic rival Kid Cudi.",
      "It ended with another ex-assistant, testifying under the pseudonym \u201cMia,\" who alleges Combs raped her during a torturous eight-year tenure working for the rap star. She is the second of three women expected to testify that he sexually assaulted them. Combs has pleaded not guilty.",
      "The trial resumes Monday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "Here are key moments from Week 3:",
      "Former employees of Combs\u2019 Bad Boy Entertainment described repeatedly witnessing him beat Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, but said they didn't report the abuse to law enforcement because they feared Combs would harm them.",
      "Clark testified that the day she started as Combs\u2019 personal assistant in 2004, he threatened he would kill her if her previous work for rival rappers interfered with her work for him.",
      "Then, she testified, she watched in shock as Combs viciously assaulted Cassie, his on-again, off-again girlfriend for more than a decade, in 2011 after learning she was dating Cudi. Clark said her \u201cheart was breaking from seeing her get hit like that,\" and neither she nor Combs\u2019 bodyguard intervened.",
      "She said she called Cassie's mother and told her: \u201cPlease help her. I can\u2019t call the police, but you can.\u201d",
      "Weeks later, Clark said, she reported what happened to Cassie to the president of Bad Boy Records.",
      "She also testified about her own run-ins with Combs, telling jurors that he kidnapped her at gunpoint and took her to Cudi\u2019s house as he fumed that he was going to kill the rapper. Cudi testified that he believed Cassie and Combs had broken up. He said his relationship with Cassie only lasted a few weeks.",
      "Clark said she stayed in Combs\u2019 SUV while he broke into the home. She said she was fired weeks later for what she contends was a trumped-up reason.",
      "One of the week\u2019s biggest developments came outside the courtroom. Cassie, 38, delivered her third child less than two weeks after testifying for four days as the prosecution\u2019s prize witness.",
      "The news of her son\u2019s birth Tuesday reached the jury the next day when Cassie\u2019s longtime stylist, Deonte Nash, testified that he was still close to Cassie and had sent her well wishes after the birth.",
      "Cassie, known for the platinum-selling 2006 hit single \u201cMe & U,\u201d married personal trainer Alex Fine in September 2019 \u2014 about a year after breaking up with Combs for good. Their first daughter, Frankie Stone Fine, was born in 2019. They welcomed a second daughter, Sunny Cinco Fine, in 2021.",
      "Jurors heard from a Los Angeles police officer who responded to the December 2011 break-in at Cudi\u2019s home and an arson investigator who spoke about his efforts to solve the firebombing of Cudi's Porsche 911 weeks later.",
      "Officer Chris Ignacio said he found Christmas gifts, some opened, with luxury watches and purses. Cudi has testified that his dog was traumatized after being locked in a bathroom by intruders.",
      "Ignacio said he saw a car with tinted windows registered to Bad Boy outside the house but didn't approach it because he had no proof a crime had occurred.",
      "Prosecutors are trying to prove that Combs was behind the break-in and the subsequent firebombing, which involved a Molotov cocktail dropped through a hole sliced in the convertible\u2019s fabric roof.",
      "Lance Jimenez, a Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigator, said the explosive was made from a 40-ounce Olde English 800 malt liquor bottle and a silky designer handkerchief.",
      "\u201cI personally felt it was targeted,\u201d he said of the Jan. 9, 2012, attack.",
      "Celebrity stylist Deonte Nash was a witness like no other, adding flair and humor within seconds of taking the stand on Wednesday. Asked if he wanted to testify, he declared: \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d",
      "Nash said he knew Combs as \u201cPuff\u201d and Cassie as \u201cCass.\u201d He said he responded to a Craigslist ad and started working at Bad Boy Entertainment as an intern and then a stylist from 2008 to 2018.",
      "Prosecutor Maurene Comey put a picture of Nash in front of him and asked, \"Is it a glamour shot of you?\u201d",
      "\u201cYes. I look amazing,\u201d Nash responded, drawing laughs.",
      "Asked what he had heard Combs call Cassie over the years, Nash answered \u201cUm, Baby Girl, CC, Cass\u201d and then listed a number of slurs against women. Asked how often Combs used one particular slur, Nash said: \u201cUm, quite a bit. That was his fave.\u201d",
      "Nash later testified that Cassie had confided in him that she didn't always want to go along with Combs\u2019 demands that she have sex with other men during his drug-fueled \u201cfreak-off\u201d marathons.",
      "Mia testified that Combs sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions: forcibly kissing her and putting his hand up her dress at his 40th birthday party, forcing her to perform oral sex as they packed for a trip, and raping her after he climbed into her bed at his Los Angeles home.",
      "Mia said she thought her sexual abuse was sporadic enough that each time it occurred, she thought it would never happen again. She said she put on a brave face and continued to work for Combs, in part because she felt shame, blamed herself and feared what would happen if she reported him to authorities.",
      "Cassie testified previously that Combs raped her after she broke up with him in 2018.",
      "Mia said she witnessed Combs physically attacking Cassie \u201call the time\u201d at his houses, her apartments, hotels, events and while traveling. She said Combs also turned his wrath on her, throwing her into a swimming pool, dumping a bucket of ice on her and hurling a bowl of spaghetti in her direction.",
      "Prosecutors insisted all week that they are ahead of schedule in presenting their case and said they could be done calling witnesses by mid-June.",
      "But Combs lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the defense\u2019s presentation might take longer than expected \u2014 particularly after prosecutors revealed they were making \u201cfairly substantial changes\u201d to their plan.",
      "\u201cIt may be that because of witnesses the government is not calling, we might have more on the defense case,\u201d he said.",
      "As a result, he added, the trial might run to the start of July.",

      "The producer, writer and comedian gazed at the shiny key handed to her by Mayor Cherelle Parker and quipped: \"Wow! I want to ask the question on everybody's mind: What does it open?\"",
      "Brunson used the ceremony held at Andrew Hamilton School to celebrate the power of public education, public schoolteachers and music and arts education. Her parents and siblings were in attendance, along with Joyce Abbott, the teacher who inspired the name of the show's fictional school, the \"real life Gregory\" and other teachers and classmates.",
      "The mural, titled Blooming Features, was created by artist Athena Scott with input from Brunson and Hamilton students and staff. Its brightly colored depictions of real people from the school wrap around the outside of the school's red brick facade.",
      "Brunson described taking inspiration from the murals painted along her subway route as a kid, especially when she saw one of her own teachers featured. She said she hopes this mural has the same effect.",
      "The actor said she nixed an initial mock-up brought to her by ABC that featured actors from the Emmy Award-winning show in favor of actual community members \u2014 because \"that's how you know there is a future.\"",
      "\"You don't need to see famous people on the wall. You need to see you on the wall,\" she said. \"Painted, beautiful. We are beautiful. It makes a difference. It made a difference for me, so I know even if it makes a difference for just one child, that one child matters.\"",
      "Jane Golden, executive director of Mural Arts Philadelphia, said she was thrilled when Brunson featured her organization on an episode of the show. Philadelphia is ranked No. 1 in the nation for its murals.",
      "\"When people visit Philadelphia, they are struck by the works of art that grace the sides of buildings in every single neighborhood of the city,\" she said. \"For us, this is a matter of equity. It's great to have world class galleries and museums \u2014 that's wonderful \u2014 but the fact that everyone everywhere can walk out the door and see large-scale works of public art that represent them, like the school here, that is awesome.\"",

    "story": [
      "Seems that there is always a lot going on behind the walls of the White House where truth can often be stranger than fiction. But fiction can be pretty compelling, too. In the new novel \"The First Gentleman\" (to be published June 2 by Little, Brown & Co.), the commander in chief is a woman, and her husband is accused of murder. It's the third collaboration from best-selling author James Patterson and his co-writer, President Bill Clinton.",
      "Was there a scenario in the book that Patterson couldn't have written without Clinton's help? \"Oh, I couldn't have done any of it without him,\" Patterson said. \"I would have been lost. But the other thing, you know, look, I mean, he's the expert on the first gentleman. You know, he was almost a first gentleman!\"",
      "\"Yeah, I thought about it for years. And it's the only political job I ever wanted and I didn't get!\" Clinton smiled. \"'Cause I really thought Hillary should be president.\"",
      "Clinton would have been the very first first gentleman had his wife, Hillary, won the 2016 election. And he says back then he did a lot of thinking about what his role would be as a presidential spouse: \"How could I do this job in a way that I would be on-call to help if she needed me, but I wouldn't get in the way?\"",
      "\"That's the way I feel about this relationship: How can I help without getting in the way?\" Patterson said. \"I'm kind of the first gentleman of our [relationship]!\"",
      "\"If you believe that, I got some land in Arizona I want to show you!\" Clinton laughed.",
      "And sometimes, their made-up White House looks almost like real life. In the book, the president keeps working through an agonizing personal crisis. During his 1999 impeachment proceedings, President Clinton kept working, too, with some of the very people who were trying to kick him out of the White House. \"And they were amazed by it,\" he said. \"They'd come and do business with me, [and] as far as they knew, I couldn't remember what was going on. And we would try to hammer out deals.\" In the midst of impeachment? \"Because that's what I got hired to do,\" Clinton said. \"The American people don't pay you to have personal feelings. They pay you to deliver for them.\"",
      "Clinton and Patterson have been delivering since 2018, with their first book about a president gone missing, and in 2021 their second about the president's daughter getting kidnapped. Both were bestsellers. But for them, it's really not all about work.",
      "Asked how their relationship has evolved over their three books together, Clinton replied, \"We've played a lot more golf.\"",
      "Patterson said, \"He's been president more times, but I have more holes-in-one.\"",
      "\"Oh God. Well, I have one; he has nine,\" said Clinton. \"How many Americans have nine holes-in-one?\"",
      "\"I know. That's sick,\" Patterson said. \"Remember I'm a fiction writer.\"",
      "\"Makes the craziness stop for a little while\"",
      "I asked, \"There's so much political drama in the world today, real-life political drama. Do you think that there's an appetite for political thrillers, for fictional political thrillers?\"",
      "Patterson said, \"I think so, 100%. I mean, one of the nice things here is you escape, but you don't totally escape reality. It's like, 'Yeah, I love this. I can't put it down.' Or 'I keep reading,' or in some cases to me what's even better, which is you don't want it to end.",
      "\"I think it's useful, and 'cause so many people are wandering around, they go, 'Oh my God, oh my God, please make it stop'? This makes it stop for a little while, makes the craziness stop for a little while for people.\"",
      "Clinton said, \"One reason I hope there's an appetite is\u2026 I hope that people will still believe in our democratic system enough to stick with it and keep pushing to make it work.\"",
      "During the summer, Patterson lives at his home on the Hudson River; the president is about five miles away.",
      "Asked what they may have learned about each other during the writing process, Patterson offered, \"the notion \u2026 of not worrying about stuff that we can't do anything about. And if we can do something about it, try to do it.\"",
      "Their new book comes out tomorrow and they hope it's another bestseller. But if you spend any time at all with Patterson and Clinton, you get the sense that their partnership is about something money can't buy.",
      "I asked, \"Back when you wrote your first book together, The New York Times said that the two of you 'complete each other in the Jerry Maguire sense.'\"",
      "\"Well, we kinda do,\" Patterson said. \"This has been driving me for months now, which is: my time here is short. What can I do most beautifully? And in this case, doing another book with my friend is a beautiful thing to do.\"",

      "Prologue",
      "President Wright AdministrationYear Three: September",
      "1Brentwood, New Hampshire",
      "Cole Wright is sitting in the rear seat of a black up-armored Chevy Suburban, one of three in a convoy speeding its way down Route 125 in the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire.",
      "Two dark green state police cruisers, lights flashing, are leading this no-frills motorcade, scaled down for the occasion. The presidential limousine \u2014 the Beast \u2014 is back at the airport, along with the Secret Service counterassault team, support personnel, news media vans, and a fully equipped ambulance.",
      "Three years after the election, Cole still gets pumped from seeing traffic part like magic, even though he's well aware that it's for the convenience and safety of the woman sitting beside him \u2014 his wife, Madeline Parson Wright, the president of the United States.",
      "He's just the First Gentleman.",
      "A light drizzle spatters against the bulletproof windows. The agent accelerates to seventy along the two-lane highway.",
      "\"Two minutes out,\" says Burton Pearce, the president's chief of staff. Pearce perches in a rear-facing jump seat across from the First Couple. He's pale and serious, wearing one of his many identical gray suits. \"The Gray Ghost,\" staffers call him. The president nods without looking up.",
      "Cole glances over to see the CONFIDENTIAL stamps on the pages Maddy is reading as the convoy hums along. He knows those pages represent the biggest political gamble of her administration \u2014 of any administration. She should be in the Oval Office working the phones and twisting arms, but instead she's here with him. A powerful personal show of support.",
      "Maddy puts her briefing packet aside. Cole takes her hand and squeezes it.",
      "She squeezes back. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"After all we've been through together, we can get through this too.\"",
      "The Suburban slows down to make a hard turn behind the police escort. Now the convoy is moving at just forty miles per hour. On both sides of the route, locals hold up crude hand-painted placards.",
      "WE BELIEVE IN YOU, COLE!",
      "STAY STRONG, COLE!",
      "KEEP MOVING, COLE!",
      "He looks out through the tinted side window. Almost game time. He can feel his muscles twitching, his focus narrowing, just like in his days as a tight end for New England \u2014 before the blown knee forced him out. He remembers how the tension in the Patriots locker room would build and build almost to the breaking point until the team ran out into the light, and when the cheers of the crowd washed over him, he'd think, Yeah, we're okay. We've got this.",
      "But today?",
      "Today he's not so sure.",
      "The redbrick facade of the Rockingham County courthouse comes into view. The road is lined with police barricades holding back hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of onlookers. Up here, some of the signs have a different tone.",
      "SCUM!",
      "MONSTER!",
      "JUSTICE FOR SUZANNE!",
      "\"Don't worry about these people,\" says Maddy. \"They don't know what they're talking about.\"",
      "\"I don't care about the people on the road,\" says Cole. \"I'm worried about the twelve people waiting for me inside.\"",
      "As the Suburban slows to a crawl, two women jump out in front and unspool a long banner.",
      "CONVICT COLE WRIGHT! SEND HIM STRAIGHT TO HELL!",
      "Thanks for the kind wishes, Cole thinks.",
      "2",
      "A thousand demonstrators, media people, and curious locals are crowded into the rain-slick parking lot. The convoy is passing through the tall evergreens flanking the pavement leading up to the courthouse when I realize I left my umbrella in my car. Too late.",
      "Rockingham County has never drawn security like this. Uniforms representing every law enforcement department in New Hampshire \u2014 from local cops to Fish and Game \u2014 are patrolling the courthouse steps. On the roof there's a detail of men and women in tactical gear and black baseball caps carrying sniper rifles. They're not even trying to hide. That's the job of their colleagues, posted in places nobody can see.",
      "I hear someone calling my name: \"Brea Cooke? That you?\"",
      "I look at the crowd. Mostly white. No surprise; the Granite State is around 89 percent Caucasian. It's a situation I got used to as a Black student at Dartmouth, about two hours north. Let's just say it's not unusual for me to stand out around here.",
      "I turn around. \"Ron Reynolds!\"",
      "Ron is a friendly face from the old days when he and my partner, Garrett Wilson, both reported for the Boston Globe. He's wearing his standard outfit \u2014 tan overcoat, khaki pants, and a tweed cap. His big press pass is dangling around his neck.",
      "I give him a quick hug. \"Guess we both forgot our umbrellas.\"",
      "A guy in a thick camo jacket jostles by us and flicks a finger at Ron's press pass. \"Fake news!\" the guy shouts. Ron ignores him.",
      "\"So why are you here?\" I ask. \"You could be in one of those gyms right now, dry and toasty. Probably getting a better view than this.\"",
      "\"I get paid to get wet,\" says Ron. \"Even if nothing happens.\"",
      "But something is happening. I've been waiting for this day a long time. I see flashing lights coming up the drive. Two state police cars and three big black SUVs.",
      "\"It's them!\"",
      "The lights are getting closer. I'm in the middle of the crowd, but suddenly I feel as alone as I've ever felt in my life.",
      "I close my eyes for a second. My mind whispers, Garrett.",
      "I blink hard. Not now! I need to focus. Capture this scene for my book. Our book. The one Garrett and I were working on together. Until he ...",
      "Ron points to the courthouse steps. \"See the podium and the camera stands up there?\"",
      "I nod. \"What about them?\"",
      "\"All for show. No way the Secret Service allows the president and First Gent to go through the front entrance.\"",
      "\"The crowd won't appreciate being tricked like that.\"",
      "\"You're right,\" says Ron. \"They came to witness history.\"",
      "So did I.",
      "The first time in history that a president's spouse is going on trial for murder.",
      "3",
      "The convoy crawls toward the entrance as cops push the crowds back. Inside the six-ton Suburban in the middle, Cole rubs his hands together nervously. Pearce leans forward in his jump seat and says, \"The county sheriffs, state troopers, and Secret Service have carved out a path so we can go around to the rear of the courthouse. By the time the crowd and the press catch on, we'll be inside and out of sight.\"",
      "Hidden away, Cole thinks. \"No,\" he says quietly. \"That's not going to happen.\"",
      "Pearce blinks. \"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"I said no. Going in through the rear of the courthouse signals that I'm guilty, that I have something to hide. Screw that. I'm going to run the ball straight through the line of scrimmage.\"",
      "The Suburban moves toward the driveway turnoff. Pearce is getting testy. \"Cole, plans have been in place for days. Best to arrive via the rear from both a safety and PR viewpoint.\"",
      "But Cole is firm. \"We go through the front door. That's final.\"",
      "He turns to his wife. \"Maddy, will you say a few words on the courthouse steps?\"",
      "It's a big ask. Maddy doesn't need to tell him the source of the tension in her eyes. The conflict between being his loving partner while serving as POTUS, leader of the free world, is etched on her face.",
      "Maddy looks at her chief of staff. \"Cole is right, Burton. We go through the front entrance, heads held high.\"",
      "\"But, ma'am, we're just about there. Arrangements have been made.\"",
      "Cole sees Maddy shift into commander-in-chief mode. Cool. Crisp. Decisive. \"You've got a phone,\" she says. \"Make new arrangements.\"",
      "4",
      "They're getting out!\" Ron grabs my sleeve.",
      "Sure enough, I hear the slamming of heavy car doors and see movement at the front of the courthouse steps. The Secret Service is scrambling to clear a path to the podium.",
      "\"That takes some brass ones!\" Ron calls to me above the rising noise.",
      "A ring of dark suits surrounds President Wright and her broad-shouldered husband.",
      "The president walks up the wide steps and pivots to the podium. The crowd surges forward. Cops push back. Secret Service agents watch the sea of faces. And hands. Especially the hands. Looking for weapons.",
      "President Wright squeezes her husband's arm just before she leans into the microphones. \"Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, I will make this short and to the point.\"",
      "I hear her voice echo across the parking lot. She pauses after each phrase to let the words sink in.",
      "\"I have full faith and confidence in my husband's innocence, and I trust that the good citizens of New Hampshire, who have stood by my side over the years, will also support my husband during this time of crisis.\"",
      "The president turns and kisses her husband's cheek, making sure the cameras have a good angle. Then, as if it's an after-thought, she steps up to the mics again and says, \"I believe in our legal system, and I'm confident justice will be done here.\"",
      "She takes her husband's hand. The Secret Service team surrounds them. As a unit, they walk up the steps to the courthouse doors.",
      "\"Quite a performance,\" says Reynolds.",
      "\"It was a performance all right. Pure theater. They're not a couple \u2014 they're a damn criminal enterprise.\"",
      "My outburst must surprise Ron. A second later, he heads off to gather quotes.",
      "Once again, I'm alone. I scan the masses. Almost every man, woman, and child is looking toward the courthouse, trying to get one last glimpse of the First Couple.",
      "On the far side of the parking lot, I spot the lone exceptions: a man and a woman, looking straight at me.",
      "I've seen these two before. My watchers.",
      "Damn. Not again.",
      "The crowd shifts, and they disappear.",
      "All around me, people are chattering and yelling, but their words are a blanket of white noise. Again my mind whispers, Garrett. I hold out my hand, half expecting to see him reaching for me.",
      "I fight back the tears as reality hits home.",
      "The love of my life, Garrett Wilson, is dead. And I believe the man inside that courthouse is responsible for his death.",
      "The First Gentleman.",
      "He might even have pulled the trigger.",

    "summary": "The writer-producer-voice artist behind the animated hit is also a crooner of the Great American Songbook. He is now releasing a new album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements.\"",
    "story": [
      "Even if you're not a regular \"Family Guy\" viewer, you've probably heard the show's iconic theme song. The song is largely the creation of Seth MacFarlane, whose love of animation may only be rivaled by his love for big, jazzy tunes. In fact, he's even got a semi-regular gig at the Vibrato Grill Jazz Club in Bel Air, Calif., singing songs from the Great American Songbook.",
      "But one thing he doesn't seem to love, considering he's lived his life in the public eye, is a certain kind of attention. He says sometimes getting in front of a crowd (or even our \"Sunday Morning\" cameras) doesn't quite come naturally.",
      "He is, he admits, an introvert. \"Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. I don't even wanna be here!\" he said.",
      "In fact, he says he sometimes has to resort to liquid courage. \"I think I had like four scotches before I walked out on stage at the Oscars,\" he said, referring to his hosting gig in 2013. \"I do get, yeah, I definitely get nervous.\"",
      "You might know MacFarlane as the voice of Peter, Brian Griffin and Stewie on the show \"Family Guy\" that he created more than two decades ago. In 1999, MacFarlane became the youngest showrunner in Hollywood history. And less than a decade later, with three network shows on the air, he became Hollywood's highest-paid writer-producer.",
      "But back in college, MacFarlane's first love was singing. \"My sister, at the time, was going to the Boston Conservatory of Music for musical theater,\" he said. \"She has a beautiful singing voice. And I had got it into my head that I was going to maybe go to grad school for musical theater as well. So, I applied and got in. And I was all set to go to their grad program. And I got this offer from Hanna-Barbera to come do an animated short for a series that they were developing. And so, I just had to take it, moved out to California. But there was an instant there where I could have kind of diverged into a completely different career and never, you know, never even thought about something called 'Family Guy.'\"",
      "MacFarlane loved film scores as a college student and to this day he uses a live orchestra to score his TV shows.\u00a0 \"It's the one part that I don't really understand, even to this day,\" he said. \"There's still something mysterious about how a composer sits down to write, and then a couple weeks later walks in front of an orchestra, plops down these charts, and they all play it. And you hear this insane, magical sound. That still eludes me.\"",
      "Frank Sinatra Jr, and Stewie and Brian (Seth MacFarlane), perform \"At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant (Jr.)\" from \"Family Guy\":",
      "For his latest album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\" (out this week), MacFarlane and Joel McNeely, his composer and arranger for \"Family Guy,\" combed through the Sinatra Family archives for songs that had been arranged for Sinatra but never fully recorded. For McNeely, the process was almost like speaking to the ghosts of the greatest arrangers in popular music, the men who helped make Sinatra's voice shine.",
      "McNeely showed an arrangement by Nelson Riddle: \"This was the first one we read when we had a sight-reading session at Fox. We got an orchestra together just to see what was there, you know, because there was nothing to reference. But all this time later, these little black pencil dots on paper, there's his voice brought back to life. I mean, it was chilling.\"",
      "So, what exactly does an arranger do? \"Frank Sinatra, there's a recording of him saying that the arrangers could be in a sense a recording secretary, taking the vision of the artist and interpreting it into this,\" McNeely said.",
      "MacFarlane said, \"You take a song like 'Fly Me to the Moon,' for example, which I think was originally a ballad. [Here], it's the same song, but it's a completely different animal.\"",
      "McNeely says MacFarlane is preserving the essential legacy of the American Songbook through his recordings and the music of the TV show \"Family Guy.\" But what about the legacy of \"Family Guy\"? MacFarlane has some thoughts: \"When I started the show \u2013 this is the conversation that, like, tortures me at night! \u2013 when I started the show, my attitude was, it doesn't matter, none of it matters. It's like, It's funny? Let's do it.",
      "\"And the older I've gotten, I look back at shows that we've done, and I'm like, Gosh, I guess it's a little more complicated than that, isn't it? Comedy and jokes do have an impact. I have to figure out a way to maintain what the show is, and maintain the thing that people love. But at the same time, recognize that, like, all right, I am analyzing it now in a different way than I did when I was younger.\"",
      "If it's true that you're nobody 'till somebody loves you, then thanks to \"Family Guy\"'s legion of fans, Seth MacFarlane, it turns out, is a very big somebody indeed.",

Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan to full life on the long-running TV series \"M*A*S*H.\" The head nurse of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War, Houlihan brought her by-the-book attitude for Army rules against the anti-authoritarian streak of Alan Alda's \"Hawkeye\" Pierce. The series was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, and while toned down for television, the CBS series, produced by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, aimed to maintain the movie's anti-establishment ethos during the turmoil of the Vietnam War.",
      "After small roles on \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Mannix\" and \"Hawaii Five-O,\" Swit was called in to meet the producers of \"M*A*S*H.\" Then her agent informed her that she'd received an offer to appear in a movie with Olivia de Havilland, which conflicted with shooting the pilot. But \"M*A*S*H\" producer Gene Reynold told the agent, \"Nope, don't give her away. She's ours,\" Swit recalled in a 2020 Edge Magazine interview.",
      "As the show progressed, Swit expanded her character beyond being the target of the doctors' pranks, and fought against her character being tied down by her affair with Maj. Frank Burns (played by Larry Linville). She suggested that Hot Lips break up with Frank, meet a dashing man in Tokyo, and get engaged, married \u2013 and divorced. \"We really worked together like a well-oiled machine \u2013 everybody on this show worked together with the writers,\" she told Edge. \"You had these creative people, throwing ideas back and forth in positive, wonderful, rich ways. It was a very exciting time to be around, to be an actor in that situation. You could not help but get better and grow and learn.\"",
      "She won two Emmys for playing Houlihan, and received eight more nominations. She was also nominated for four Golden Globes. Although some actors came and went, Swit lasted throughout the show's 11-season run, which concluded in 1983.",
      "A native of Passaic, N.J., Swit had to overcome her mother's aversion to her becoming an actress. She recalled to the Toronto Star in 2010 her mom's reaction after attending a play in a Greenwich Village theater, \"walking in as though it were the doorway to Hades. After the show, I came out and my mother said to my father, 'If you don't stop her now, she may wind up doing this for the rest of her life.' That was it. That gave me the courage I needed to keep at it until I succeeded.\"",
      "On stage she starred in \"Same Time, Next Year,\" \"Shirley Valentine,\" and \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\" Other screen appearances include \"Freebie and the Bean,\" \"S.O.B.,\" and \"Murder She Wrote.\" She also founded a charity, the SwitHeart Animal Alliance.",
      "Houlihan would inspire countless women to become nurses, in part because the show was closer to reality that other medical shows. \"Up until 'M*A*S*H,' the doctors on television didn't lose patients; they always pulled them through,\" she said. \"That's nice, but it's not honest. We used to say that 'M*A*S*H' is not a John Wayne movie about war. In our series, people died, patients died, people got wounded and hurt. And we never stop talking about the ugliness of it. The humor came out of our own madness and craziness to have to be there to do that. The only way to survive was by being crazy and funny and drunk. I think 'M*A*S*H' took on cult status because we told everybody the truth.\""

    "story": [
      "Patti LuPone\u00a0has issued an apology after hundreds of Broadway performers spoke out against the three-time Tony Awards winner over what they say is a pattern of \"inappropriate and unacceptable public comments,\" specifically against Broadway star Kecia Lewis, in an open letter.",
      "\"For as long as I have worked in the theatre, I have spoken my mind and never apologized. That is changing today.\" LuPone said in her apology posted Saturday on social media.",
      "Lupone issued the apology in response to a\u00a0letter, dated May 30\u00a0 and addressed to the American Theatre Wing, the national trade association for the Broadway theatre industry, calling on decision makers to \"hold people accountable for violent, disrespectful, or harmful behavior.\" More than 500 Broadway performers \u2014 including\u00a0James Monroe Iglehart, Kalen Allen and\u00a0Tatianna C\u00f3rdoba \u2014 signed the open letter, which was first published in\u00a0Playbill.",
      "It comes after the New Yorker published an interview last week with 76-year-old LuPone, a White performer, in which she said of Lewis, who is a Black actress said: \"Don't call yourself a vet, bitch,\" apparently referring to Lewis' November 2024 video\u00a0posted to her Instagram\u00a0in which she spoke about LuPone's behavior.",
      "\"This language is not only degrading and misogynistic-it is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment. It is emblematic of the microaggressions and abuse that people in this industry have endured for far too long, too often without consequence,\" said the open letter.",
      "LuPone's issue with Lewis appeared to have began last fall when she starred in\u00a0\"The Roommate,\" a two-woman show with Mia Farrow\u00a0that was next door to\u00a0\"Hell's Kitchen,\"\u00a0a musical inspired by Alicia Key's life and music in which Lewis performed and won Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.",
      "According to Lewis' video, LuPone had made complaints about the noise from the musical, which led to changes to the sound design that \"negatively impacted\" the show and its performers. Lewis also brought up a video of LuPone refusing to sign a fan's \"Hell's Kitchen\" playbill because the musical is \"too loud.\"",
      "\"I wanted to address this because, Ms. LuPone, these actions, in my opinion, are bullying,\" Lewis said in the video. \"They're offensive, they are racially microaggressive, they're rude, they're rooted in privilege. And these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself, who has been in the business as long as you have.\"",
      "Lewis then asked LuPone, from one Broadway veteran to another, to apologize.",
      "When asked, LuPone addressed the situation in the New Yorker article, saying, \"This is not unusual on Broadway. This happens all the time when walls are shared.\"",
      "\"She calls herself a veteran? Let's find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn't know what the f--- she's talking about,\" LuPone told the New Yorker.",
      "CBS News has reached out to LuPone and Lewis for comment.",
      "When the New Yorker asked about Audra McDonald, who appeared to support Lewis' video, LuPone said: \"That's typical of Audra. She's not a friend.\" She added that the two had issues in the past, but didn't go into details.",
      "In her apology on Saturday, LuPone said she regrets her \"flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate, and I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in this community.\"",
      "\"I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies,\" LuPone added. \"I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter shared yesterday. From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theatre has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don't belong anywhere else. I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theatre community deserves better.\"",
      "McDonald, the most nominated and awarded performer in Tony Award history, told CBS News' Gayle King in an interview set to air Tuesday on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings\" that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years.",
      "\"If there's a rift between us, I don't know what it is. That's something you'd have to ask Patti about,\" McDonald said.",
      "Next week on June 8, the Tony Awards are set to broadcast on CBS and stream on Paramount+. McDonald could add snatch her seventh Tony win thanks to the revival of \"Gypsy.\"",

      "Swit starred on stage and screen, but she was perhaps best known for her long-running role as the head nurse who was a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce on \"M*A*S*H,\" which aired for 11 seasons on CBS, from 1972 to 1983.",
      "The show was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, a landmark celebrated for its freewheeling humor, its satirical approach to war movies, the excess of blood in the operating room and the nudity of its nurses. The TV series, produced by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, was toned down for television but maintained the movie's anti-establishment ethos.",

Frank Burns, and William Christopher as Father Francis Mulcahy.

      "\"Around the second or third year I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes,\" Swit told the author of \"The Complete Book of 'M.A.S.H,'\" Suzy Kalter.",
      "\"To oversimplify it, I took each traumatic change that happened in her life and kept it. I didn't go into the next episode as if it were a different character in a different play. She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.\"",

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",
      "\"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.",

      "\"Studies including hundreds of thousands of people around the world show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective, and beneficial to both the pregnant woman and the baby.

      "The CDC also deleted a statement previously on the childhood immunization schedule that the guidance had been recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC and backed by a number of outside medical groups.",
      "So far, the CDC's changes echo what the committee had already been considering voting on next month: narrowing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and younger ages with risk factors, but still allowing for permissive coverage of others getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has used \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance in the past to allow for federal requirements guaranteeing insurance coverage and access to some vaccines, while stopping short of full-throated recommendations for everyone eligible to get a shot.",
      "At its last meeting in April, the committee had not signaled that they were planning to lift the recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its warning about the risk of contracting measles while traveling, after the agency tallied dozens of cases so far this year in travelers who were infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S.",
      "\"Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,\" the agency now says, in an update published Wednesday.",
      "Since the beginning of the year, the CDC has received at least 62 reports of travelers who were contagious with the highly transmissible virus while flying into the U.S. or within the country, a spokesperson for the health agency told CBS News in a statement.",
      "After investigating 50 of those travelers, the CDC was able to determine that measles spread during air travel in at least one of those situations, the spokesperson said. That is usually based on connecting confirmed cases of measles among airline passengers sitting near each other.",
      "There have also been numerous public alerts in recent months about the possible risk of exposure in airports, after travelers were found to be contagious. \"Exposures at the airport itself are more difficult to track, and state, local, and territorial health departments lead these investigations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In its Wednesday update, the CDC dropped its list of countries now facing \"high incidence\" of measles. Instead, the agency now warns only that the virus is \"an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected.\"",
      "In addition to this year's record surge of the virus within the U.S., health authorities in neighboring Mexico and Canada have also reported large outbreaks of measles.",
      "The CDC also replaced a previous recommendation that Americans \"consider making alternative travel plans\" if they could not get vaccinated before departing, and now says travelers should \"consider postponing their trip.\"",
      "All travelers are recommended to be fully vaccinated for measles before going to any international destination. The CDC recently updated its guidance to doctors advising additional measles vaccines\u00a0for some domestic travelers as well.",
      "The changes come as the CDC's tally of measles cases has begun to show signs of accelerating again.",
      "At least 1,088 cases of measles have been reported so far this year, the CDC said Friday, with two more states \u2014 Iowa and Nebraska \u2014 now reporting their first confirmed cases. Around 90% of confirmed cases are linked to outbreaks within the U.S., not travel outside the country.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As state officials anticipate Medicaid funding cuts that could strip resources for those with disabilities and chronic health conditions, an army of unpaid caregivers waits in the wings: children.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.",
      "\"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,\" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. \"And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.\"",
      "In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.",
      "But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're \"actual people\" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.",
      "\"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,\" he said.",

      "Beryl Fitzpatrick is one of the residents affected. You can hear the cancer as she speaks.",
      "\"I was having trouble swallowing,\" she recalled.",
      "Fitzpatrick was diagnosed with Stage 3 tongue cancer. She didn't know if she would ever speak again after doctors removed part of her tongue while removing a cancerous tumor, but she fought to keep her voice.",
      "\"I had to learn phonics. I had to learn, I had to learn words and sounds,\" she said. \"It was humbling.\"",
      "And she knows the very air in her own backyard could be playing a role in her disease.",
      "\"It's almost certain that her place of residence, with the high pollution and other industrial output contributed to her cancer,\" said Dr. Kerstin Stenson, lead of the head and neck cancer program at Rush University Medical Center who's been treating Fitzpatrick.",
      "The City of Gary was built by the steel industry, but when families like Fitzpatrick's moved to the region in droves from the South during the Great Migration for jobs and opportunities, they didn't know as much as we do now about the health risks linked to industrial production.",
      "\"A lot of the teachers would talk about students that had asthma,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "Seven major coal-powered steel production plants operate in the United States. Three plants are clustered in the Gary region: Burns Harbor, Gary Works and Indiana Harbor.",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigators dug into state and federal data from the Environmental Protection Agency to see how these facilities impact the community.",
      "Our investigation found that in 2023, the latest data available, the three mills emitted 25 million pounds of toxins, more industrial pollution than the combined toxic release of the four similar mills in other states.",
      "\"We do not need to sacrifice health and communities to make steel,\" said Hilary Lewis, a director of Industrial Labs.",
      "Industrial Labs, a nonprofit environmental organization, released a report in October 2024 detailing its findings on the steel industry's impact on the community.",
      "\"The people in Northwest Indiana are bearing the brunt of the coal-based steel industry today,\" she said.",
      "The study found people living near one steel production facility have a 12% to 26% higher risk of getting cancer. People in Gary live near three.",
      "And cancer isn't the only health risk associated with this kind of industrial exposure.",
      "Industrial Labs' study found people living in Gary are in the top 10% of the nation at risk for developing asthma. Even Gary Mayor Eddie Melton grew up with asthma, and the irony of the steel industry that built the city now being the thing making people sick is not lost on him.",
      "\"I mean, that's a stark reality that a lot of folks have to deal with,\" Melton said.",
      "The mayor wants this dealt with, in part, by toughening toxic emissions standards. But that may not happen; in March, the federal EPA announced it's considering lowering some standards polluters must meet.",
      "\"What we're seeing from a federal and state government concerns me, in terms of rolling back the regulations on industries such as the steel industry, and other industries,\" Mayor Melton said.",
      "Gary already fails to meet federal air quality standards. Lake County, Indiana has more toxic releases than 99% of all other counties across the country, and the state ranks second in the nation for the most industrial pollution released per square mile.",
      "So what is the EPA doing for the people of Gary?",
      "\"They're responsible for protecting clean air,\" Lewis said. \"And right now, they're not doing that.\"",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigatiors dug into EPA records dating back to 1977 and found that since then the EPA took 152 formal actions against the steel production facilities. Nearly half of those actions were for violating the Clean Air Act. For those air pollution violations, regulators issued more than $23 million in penalties paid by the parent companies.",
      "\"If you're a multi-billion-dollar corporation, fees and fines probably are just a drop in the bucket for you,\" Melton said.",
      "Both the state and federal EPA declined interviews but sent statements saying they act when facilities are out of compliance, and those actions have reduced air emissions.",
      "Fitzpatrick lives about 43 blocks from the largest steel mill in the nation, and we found they released more pollutants than any other steel or iron mill tracked by the EPA across the country.",
      "More than half the industrial pollution in Lake County comes from Gary Works, which is owned by U.S Steel.",
      "U.S. Steel declined an interview, but responded to questions by email, saying the EPA's data includes byproducts \"legally emitted,\" and said they have systems in place to comply with environmental regulations.",
      "In regards to the Industrial Labs report, U.S. Steel said it was \"designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick has lived in Gary for 60 of her 71 years, never fully knowing what she was exposed to.",
      "\"I didn't think I was living a lifestyle that was polluting my body,\" she said.",
      "She wasn't. Dr. Stenson said Fitzpatrick doesn't have the typical risk factors for her cancer. And she's not alone.",
      "\"There are many patients that have come from that industrial area that would present with head and neck cancer without risk factors,\" Stenson said.",
      "Gary has been notorious for its pollution for decades.",
      "Dr. Mihir Bhayani, also at Rush University Medical Center, is getting closer to directly linking air pollution and some cancers. The new research he is working on could force change.",
      "\"What we are working on currently is, again, a direct causal link between air pollution and head and neck cancer,\" he said.",
      "He believes steel mills are making people sick in Gary, and he wants to see emissions standards toughened.",
      "\"So that individuals who are living in those areas, they're exposed to the same clean air that individuals who are living in more affluent areas are,\" he said.",
      "\"The types of communities that this industry is impacting are disproportionately people of color and low-income communities,\" said Lewis.",
      "More than 76% of Gary's population is Black, and the average income is less than $23,000 a year.",
      "About four hours away from Gary by car is the steel plant in Middletown, Ohio. It's getting a major portion of a $500 million federal grant to change the steel-making process and cut hazardous pollution in that city, which has an average income of $30,000 a year and is 73% white.",
      "Fitzpatrick believes more would be done to keep the air clean and her community healthy if Gary's demographics were different.",
      "\"I am worthy. No matter what you think about my Black skin, my dark skin, I'm worthy. I'm worthy for this community to be cleaned up and I am a person worthy of a good life,\" she said.",
      "Gary and other communities found to be disproportionately impacted by pollution were getting extra help from the federal EPA's Environmental Justice office, but in April it was labeled a DEI program and shut down.",
      "If nothing is done, Bhayani said, there will be long-term effects on people living in communities like Gary.",
      "\"They are going to have higher rates of cancer. They're going to have higher rates of cardiac disease. They're going to have high rates of lung disease,\" Bhayani said.",
      "That's why Fitzgerald, who fought for her voice while still battling the disease that nearly took it, said she'll do whatever it takes to make change here so that it can be different for someone else.",
      "\"As long as I have breath and I can breathe and I have strength to get up, I'm going to join other people, like-minded people. We're going to fight. We're going to fight,\" she said.",
      "Cleveland Cliffs, which owns two of the plants in Northwest Indiana, did not return messages from CBS News Chicago Investigators. U.S. Steel maintains its work is essential to the health of the American economy.",
      "But Fitzgerald and others who live there worry about their own health, and they're asking lawmakers to step up and join their fight for cleaner air.",

      "FULL STATEMENTS",
      "On whether they have studied the impact of releases from Gary Works and the health effects, including cancer and asthma, in the community:",
      "\"In 2020, the EPA deemed that there was an ample margin of safety around iron and steel emissions to protect public health and prevent adverse environmental effects.\"",
      "It is important to note that there are many industrial facilities in Northwest Indiana. Focusing solely on Gary Works as a source of pollution is both incorrect and irresponsible.",
      "On the study released by Industrial Labs:",
      "\"It is clear that these conclusions were pre-determined by a group that describes itself as 'scaling campaigns and building a movement to clean up heavy industry', which is to say that this document is designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions. There are certain interests campaigning to eliminate U.S.-based blast furnaces, which are essential to national security and the health of America's economy because they are the only facilities capable of making certain types and qualities of steels required for critical applications.\"",
      "On residents believing toxic releases would not be allowed at the same level in more affluent communities with different demographics:",
      "\"Federal and state emissions laws and regulations apply equally to any municipality in the same jurisdiction. Gary, Indiana, is no exception. We care deeply about the communities where we live and work, as evidenced by the contributions by the Company and our employees. Since 2020, U. S. Steel Gary Works and its employees have donated over $1.3 million dollars to community organizations and efforts. In addition, our dedicated employees volunteer countless hours of their time to organizations and schools across the area. Our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees put safety and environmental compliance first. We are proud of their work and the Northwest Indiana community we call home.\"",
      "\"In addition to our spend on environmental compliance and community investment and engagement, we were the only U.S. Metals, Minerals and Mining company recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for 2025- the fourth consecutive year we received this designation. It is a testament to our commitment to ethical conduct and compliance.\"",
      "\"Gary Works was built in 1908, and the city was built around it. Any notion that we select certain areas to operate because of their demographics is wholly incorrect.\"",
      "On state and federal EPA fines, violations and consent decrees:",
      "\"U. S. Steel spends more than $80 million annually on environmental controls in Indiana as part of its commitment to environmental excellence. The EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, from which this data is drawn, includes manufacturing byproducts that are legally emitted under the EPA's stringent regulations and those which are legally disposed of in permitted landfills. As the nation's largest integrated steelmaking facility, it is common sense that U. S. Steel's Gary Works will have more legally allowed releases than smaller iron or steel mills in the country.\"",
      "Additional comment on emissions controls and other projects:",
      "\"U. S. Steel has robust systems and emissions control equipment at all levels of the steelmaking process to adhere to environmental regulations.",
      "At Gary Works, our processes and environmental controls are monitored extensively by our teams. Third parties are also used for sampling water and for opacity observation to ensure compliance with regulations.",
      "Our partnership with CarbonFree is one of the ways we're working to reduce emissions. This carbon capture and utilization project will help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions by converting emissions to calcium carbonate, which is used in a variety of products for consumers and industry.\u00a0 Gary Works also produces Pig Iron, an important feedstock for U. S. Steel's electric arc furnaces. The Company is on track to meet its goal of 20% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 goal and has a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\"",
      "IDEM is not a health agency nor a legislative body. IDEM is also not involved in local zoning decisions that determine where businesses are located.",
      "IDEM is responsible for implementing and enforcing existing federal and state environmental regulations. This includes issuing operating permits that ensure businesses comply with applicable environmental standards and conducting routine inspections to monitor compliance. When facilities are found to be out of compliance, IDEM can initiate enforcement actions or refer cases for further legal or administrative review.",
      "The U.S. EPA does require states to submit a state implementation plan (SIP) for areas in nonattainment within its borders. You can find more information on the SIPs for Lake and Porter counties here: https://www.in.gov/idem/sips/",
      "In 2013, IDEM conducted an assessment of air toxics in the industrialized area of Lake and Porter County. The complete Lakeshore Air Toxics Study is available here: https://www.in.gov/idem/toxic/studies/lakeshore-air-toxics-study. The study found air toxics concentrations and risk within the lakeshore area to be similar to comparable communities, and the most significant risk is attributable to mobile sources (motor vehicles). In the time since the study, technological advances and pollution prevention strategies have led to a further decline in industrial emissions.",
      "We recognize that air quality is a deeply important issue for Northwest Indiana residents and remain committed to our responsibilities under the Clean Air Act and other applicable laws. For more specific responses to questions involving federal enforcement actions, health data, or proposed changes to emission standards, we encourage you to follow up directly with the U.S. EPA.",
      "EPA is fulfilling its mission to protect human health and the environment. The agency works with our state partners to ensure industrial facilities comply with all environmental laws and regulations.",
      "EPA performs on-site and off-site inspections to ensure compliance. If noncompliance is found, EPA takes action. EPA has issued three recent Clean Air Act enforcement settlements, which have significantly reduced air emissions. In Burns Harbor, Cleveland Cliffs BOF steel making shop and Phoenix Global slag processing companies and in Gary, the U.S. Steel Gary Works' blast furnace have all decreased particulate matter and metal hazardous air pollutants to the atmosphere. Our state partner, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, also conducts inspections and enforcement actions.",
      "Previous compliance and enforcement work, including inspections and enforcement activity, can be found in EPA's ECHO system. You can search by location or by facility. Keep in mind that the integrated iron and steel mills that you reference may have contractors on site that have separate permits and emissions reporting.",
      "The northern portions of Lake and Porter Counties are part of a larger Chicago area that was found to be out of compliance with the ground-level ozone (or \"smog\") standard.\u00a0 Ozone high in the atmosphere protects people from harmful ultraviolet rays but at ground-level it can trigger a variety of health problems, such as lung irritation.",

The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",

    "summary": "As the trade standoff with China continues, President Trump announced the tariff on foreign steel will double from 25% to 50%.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday defended the Trump administration's escalating tariff policies, saying that while some companies have already announced price hikes, he thinks others will\u00a0 choose not to.",
      "\"Some are and some aren't,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" He pointed to companies like Home Depot and Amazon who have indicated they will not pass on tariff costs to consumers, whereas others, such as Walmart and Best Buy, have signaled potential price increases.",
      "President Trump on Friday announced that the tariff on foreign steel will double from 25% to 50%, effective June 4, and accused Beijing of violating a recent trade agreement by withholding critical exports like rare earth minerals.",
      "\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Friday morning on his Truth Social app.",
      "He added, \"The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement is the latest in the tariff standoff, coming nearly two months after Mr. Trump announced \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on the U.S.' trading partners, eventually hiking the levy on Chinese to 145%. China responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. In May, the U.S. eased the tariff on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China agreed then to reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "Bessent on Sunday emphasized the White House's intention is not to \"decouple\" from China but to \"de-risk,\"and defended the new trade stance as essential to national and economic security.",
      "\"What China is doing is holding back products essential for industrial supply chains in India and Europe,\" Bessent said. \"That is not what a reliable partner does.\"",
      "Retailers, however, have sounded the alarm about the ripple effects of the ongoing U.S.-China trade standoff. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target have warned that high tariffs on imports from Asia could drive up prices for American consumers.",
      "Bessent addressed such warnings as speculative, highlighting companies who have opted not to raise prices.",
      "\"I know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying,\" he said. \"They're not raising prices. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration has identified sectors where Americans will feel the impact most, Bessent pointed to easing food and energy prices, and insisted that overall inflation is falling. \"Egg prices have collapsed,\" he said, crediting the administration's economic council and trade policies. Although egg prices have come down from the highest levels earlier this year, the Consumer Price Index showed in May that egg prices are still 49% higher than they were in May 2024.",
      "Despite industry concerns, Bessent argued Sunday that companies often offer worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to shield themselves from legal risk.",
      "\"They have to give the worst case,\" he said. \"Because if they haven't, and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced that he would be doubling tariffs on steel to 50% as he visited a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh suburbs Friday, a week after teasing a \"planned partnership\" between the company and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel.",
      "\"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump later noted\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that the increase would also be applied to aluminum, and would take effect on June 4.",
      "The Nippon deal will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, according to Mr. Trump, who characterized the agreement last Sunday as \"an investment\" and \"partial ownership\" that will be \"controlled\" by the United States. The administration, however, has released few details about the deal.",
      "\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement last week was the latest twist in Nippon's yearslong effort to acquire U.S. Steel. Its nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden in January on national security grounds.",
      "Mr. Trump, who opposed the acquisition during the 2024 campaign, has since warmed to a deal between the steel producers, touting a $14 billion investment that the president said would \"create and save over 100,000 American jobs.\"",
      "\"You're going to be very happy,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"There's a lot of money coming your way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal includes \"vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.\" He added that U.S. Steel would also keep all of its blast furnace facilities at full capacity for at least the next decade and vowed that there would be \"no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.\" Every worker at U.S. Steel would soon be receiving a $5,000 bonus as well, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he approved a deal after the persistence of Nippon, whose offer kept getting \"better and better\" each time the company made another proposal.",
      "Later Friday night, after returning from his visit, Mr. Trump told reporters he has to approve the final deal with Nippon, and that \"we haven't seen that final deal yet.\"",
      "Sen. David McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, provided more details on the agreement in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., an arrangement that was also part of the deal rejected by Biden.",
      "McCormick did raise one potential difference in the latest iteration, stating that the U.S. would have a golden share.",
      "\"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\" McCormick said. \"There'll be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.\"",
      "McCormick said Nippon will have \"certainly members of the board, and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.\"",
      "\"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market \u2014 this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,\" McCormick said of Nippon. \"They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.\"",
      "It is not yet clear whether the golden share provision involves any U.S. ownership of the merged companies.",
      "The United Steelworkers union has opposed a sale, arguing that the Japanese company is making \"flashy promises\" that put American jobs at risk.",
      "In a statement Friday, union president David McCall said the group was not included or consulted in the discussions \"so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the 'planned partnership' between USS and Nippon or the 'golden share' that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.\"",
      "\"There is a vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing, just as there is a vast difference between allowing shareholders and executives to cash-out and putting workers' interests first,\" he said. \"Any final deal that may emerge from discussions between the merger parties and the federal government must be viewed through that lens, and not the lens of wishful thinking that has been adopted by far too many politicians and others.\"",
      "But without an acquisition, U.S. Steel had warned last year that the company would \"largely pivot away\" from its blast furnace facilities, which would put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The company said the future of its headquarters in Pittsburgh was also uncertain without an agreement.",

      "Las Vegas \u2014 The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is usually the first stop for millions of tourists. But the line to snap a photo is noticeably shorter this spring as inflation, which has brought on higher prices for visitors, has hit \"Sin City\" hard.",
      "\"We were here last year, almost exactly the same time,\" John Fischer, who is visiting from the United Kingdom, told CBS News. \"And it was probably 20% more [expensive] this year.\"",
      "U.K. tourist Stuart Woodfall said he was surprised to pay $9 for a coffee.",
      "\"In the U.K., we pay 4 pounds, 5 pounds for a coffee? So yeah, crazy,\" Woodfall said.",
      "Those higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic, but casual trips are down. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said 3.39 million people visited in March, down 7.8% from the same time last year. April saw a 5.1% drop in visitors from April 2024.",
      "Hotel occupancy also slipped, as the average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip reached $203 in April, the LVCVA said, up from $194 at the same time last year. The hotel occupancy rate rate in April was 84.5%, down slightly from 85.5% in April of 2024.",
      "\"I think what's driving that largely now is just a drop in consumer confidence,\" Steve Hill, CEO and president of the LVCVA, told CBS News.",
      "Hill says big resorts can absorb a few empty rooms if the price is right.",
      "\"The philosophy in Las Vegas prior to the pandemic was, at any cost, fill a room,\" Hill said. \"Now, that has moderated somewhat. And so there is a balance point that they have found that is actually a little bit below the occupancy that we saw at a peak, which was about 88% in 2019. They're comfortable in that 85% range at a little higher price.\"",
      "Another sore spot is that Las Vegas is seeing fewer international visitors, Hill explains. They are the ones who generally tend to stay longer and spend more.",
      "\"It's an investment in a trip, and we're typically a bucket list,\" Hill said. \"They want to come here, spend more days, really enjoy the experiences that are here. And so when we lose them, we're losing a very valuable customer.\"",
      "Tourists who do roll the dice in Vegas are currently dealing with heavy vehicle traffic. Months of construction and road closures for special events can turn a 10-minute ride into a crawl on the Strip.",
      "\"We've had so many customers say, 'We're never coming back to this city, you can't get anywhere,'\" said Will Tryon, co-owner of Adventure Photo Tours, which he operates with his wife Donna Tryon. Their company does tours in the surrounding region, including the Grand Canyon, Area 51, Zion National Park and Death Valley.",
      "The couple said higher fuel and insurance costs leave little room to cut prices. Some tours priced at $75 before the COVID-19 pandemic are now $109.",
      "\"The economy, the money, they don't have the money to spend,\" Donna told CBS News. \"And the fact is that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation.\"",
      "Even so, plenty of visitors are still shelling out for hot tickets like Dead & Company's residency at the Sphere this spring, and Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter Tour, which is coming to Allegiant Stadium in July.",
      "\"It's like, you can go for the fancy experience, but then you can find a place that's a pretty good price,\" said Marc Kutzin, who is visiting from New York.",
      "The summer calendar is full of concerts, festivals and sporting events, and Hill believes the city will be resilient.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply county-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",
      "These tariffs differ from Section 301 levies in that the tariff rate is capped at 50%. Additionally, no formal investigation is required. The authority has never been used, according to experts.",

      "The investigation into the bitcoin torture case in New York City has revealed gruesome details about the alleged kidnapping and beating of an Italian man for his fortune in the cryptocurrency.",
      "What we know about the bitcoin torture case",
      "The unidentified 28-year-old man managed to escape from his alleged captors on May 23 in the affluent SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan, according to the New York Police Department. Bloodied and not wearing shoes, the man then found an NYPD traffic agent, who alerted police, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office.",
      "Two cryptocurrency investors, 37-year-old John Woeltz and 33-year-old William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment in the case. They're being held without bail. Attorneys for the suspects have declined to comment on the case.",
      "When investigators went through the SoHo town house where the man said he was held, they found a saw, crack cocaine, chicken wire, body armor, night-vision goggles, pictures of the man with a gun pointed to his head and ammunition, according to prosecutors.",
      "Woeltz, who is originally from Kentucky, was arrested when police went to the town house. Prosecutors said the large house has eight bedrooms and that Woeltz had the means to flee the jurisdiction if granted bail, with access to a private jet and a helicopter.",
      "Duplessie turned himself in to police on May 27, the NYPD said. His attorney said in court that Duplessie's involvement in the case is hotly disputed and he decided to turn himself in when he found out about Woeltz's arrest, CBS News New York reported.",
      "The Italian man arrived at the town house on May 6, according to prosecutors. The suspects are accused of previously threatening to have the man's family killed unless he paid them in bitcoin, and the suspects allegedly lured him to New York with an offer to return the bitcoin to him in person, prosecutors said.",
      "The suspects then allegedly held the man captive for over two weeks as they tried to get him to give up the password for his bitcoin wallet.",
      "During that time, the suspects are accused of shocking the man with electric wires, hitting him on the head with a gun and pointing a gun at his head several times, prosecutors said. An AirTag tracking device was tied around the man's neck, and the suspects allegedly told him they would find him if he left the house.",
      "Prosecutors also said the suspects allegedly hanged the man over the ledge of the building and threatened to kill him if he didn't give up his password. The suspects also allegedly threatened to have the man's family killed if he didn't give them what they wanted, prosecutors said.",
      "The man told authorities the suspects cut his leg with a saw, forced him to smoke crack cocaine and urinated on him during his captivity, according to prosecutors.",
      "\"To be tortured for 17 days in terms of a chain saw cutting your leg, in terms of putting your feet in water and electrocuting him, in terms of making the person ingest narcotics, horrible crime,\" NYPD Chief of Department John Chell, the police department's highest-ranking uniformed member, told CBS News New York.",
      "The man escaped after telling Woeltz he would give him the password, but it was on his laptop, prosecutors said. When Woeltz went to get the laptop, the man went downstairs and bolted from the house.",
      "Police sources told CBS News New York that two NYPD detectives did private security work for the suspects, but there isn't any indication that the detectives knew about the alleged kidnapping. One of the detectives picked up the Italian man at an airport and brought him to the SoHo town house, two sources told CBS News New York.",
      "The detectives were placed on desk duty May 28 and had their guns and badges taken from them pending an internal affairs investigation into the off-duty work, which the NYPD said wasn't authorized.",
      "One of the detectives was assigned to the security detail for New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\"Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty,\" Kayla Mamelak Altus, Adams' press secretary, said in a statement. \"We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.\"",

    "story": [
      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

      "Mondelez International, the company behind Oreo, Wheat Thins and other name-brand products, says Aldi is copying its packaging in an effort to dupe customers into buying the supermarket chain's products.",
      "In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Illinois, the snack company alleges that Aldi \"blatantly copies\" the distinctive packaging of its brands in order to mislead customers into thinking they are buying a Mondelez product when they are actually purchasing a store-brand version. The company is seeking monetary damages and a court order that would prevent Aldi from selling products Mondelez says infringe on its trademarks.",
      "Neither Aldi nor Mondelez immediately responded to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Mondelez names a number of Aldi products in its lawsuit that it alleges are look-alikes of its own popular snacks such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins, Nilla Wafers cookies and Nabisco Premium Saltine Crackers. The company claims the Aldi store-brand items have different names but bear similar packaging design elements \u2014 including font, colors, image placement and product names \u2014 to Mondelez products.",
      "Aldi's Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies, for example, come in a red box, similar to that of Mondelez's Nutter Butter cookies. The white script font and cookie image on the packaging also mimic the Nutter Butter packaging, the snack company claims.",
      "Aldi also sells a product called Thin Wheat, which in addition to the nearly synonymous name to Nabisco's Wheat Thins, has a similar design to the Mondelez product, including a yellow background, the word \"original\" and crackers pictured on the bottom half of the box, the lawsuit says.",

    "summary": "A rash of attacks on cryptocurrency owners is combining cybercrime with old-fashioned thuggery, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The recent case of an Italian tourist who was kidnapped in New York City and tortured by people allegedly after his cryptocurrency is drawing attention to a rash of crimes dubbed \"wrench attacks,\" which combine cybertheft with old-fashioned thuggery.",
      "The term stems from an XKCD comic that depicts a \"crypto nerd's imagination\" of the tech know-how that would be required to break into their digital wallet. In reality, the comic notes, all it would take is a heavy $5 wrench to threaten the crypto owner until they revealed their account password.",
      "Such attacks have picked up in recent months, partly because stealing a digital wallet can be easier than stealing money from a traditional bank account, said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, a crypto tracing firm. On top of that, the value of bitcoin has surged in recent months, making people with crypto holdings potentially lucrative targets for criminals.",
      "\"Criminals go to where the money is, and we're seeing a huge rise in the price of bitcoin,\" Redbord said. \"Before, you needed sophisticated cyber capabilities to hack someone, but now you can be a violent criminal who can beat [the password] out of someone.\"",
      "He added, \"I don't think I've ever been as taken aback by this type of illicit activity in crypto.\"",
      "The crypto world also has a culture of flaunting wealth via social media posts or appearances at crypto conference, which allows criminals to easily identify potential targets.",
      "Bitcoin traded Friday at nearly $105,000 per token, according to CoinDesk \u2014 about 53% higher than a year ago. The digital currency has soared partly as people seek alternatives to put their money than traditional investments like stocks and bonds, and as the Trump administration takes steps to promote the use of cryptocurrencies, including establishing a \"strategic crypto reserve.\"",
      "How to crack a wallet",
      "Cryptocurrency thefts aren't new, but they've typically involved hacking, such as a massive 2022 hack at crypto exchange Binance\u00a0in which thieves initially stole $570 million, as well as multiple hacks by entities the United Nations found were linked to North Korea.",
      "In response to such threats, crypto owners often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \"cold wallets.\" When used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But criminals have realized they don't need any technical skills to steal crypto assets, Redbord said. All it takes is gaining access to a person's crypto account password, because there's no third-party financial institution standing in the way of accessing funds held in a digital wallet, he explained.",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don't need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "NYC crypto kidnapping",
      "The case in New York City is somewhat unusual because it involves crypto investors allegedly trying to steal the assets of another investor, Redbord said.",
      "In that case, investors John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, face\u00a0charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment of the Italian tourist in an effort to steal his digital wallet containing bitcoin worth millions of dollars. Court papers allege that the pair held the unidentified 28-year-old victim for weeks in an apartment in New York City's fashionable Soho neighborhood.",
      "After the victim was abducted, he was shocked with electric wires, his leg was cut with a saw and he was forced to smoke crack cocaine, prosecutors allege. Items including a photo of a gun held to the Italian tourist's head were found in the apartment by investigators.",
      "Two New York City police detectives had been working security for the accused kidnappers, CBS News New York has reported. The detective have been placed on desk duty as police investigate.",
      "Such incidents have also occurred with increasing frequency in Europe and Asia. Several cases in France have mirrored the New York City attack, with French police arresting 20 people following several alleged kidnapping plots involving crypto investors and their families, the BBC reported earlier this week.",
      "In one case, a gang allegedly tried to kidnap the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency company executive in Paris, while earlier this month the father of a crypto millionaire was rescued by police in Paris after he was kidnapped and held for ransom.",
      "Aside from keeping a lower profile, crypto investors can take other steps to make it tougher for criminals, Redbord said. One option is to require permissions from several people to access a wallet, for instance.",
      "In the meantime, criminals are taking note and may be pursuing similar crimes, he added. \"They are seeing successes and trying to replicate these successes,\" Redbord said.",

      "Counselors who work with foreign students eager to attend college in the U.S. are advising them to purge their social media accounts of posts that could attract the attention of U.S. State Department officials.",
      "\"Any new student who comes on board \u2014 especially an international student who doesn't have a U.S. passport \u2014 we would be going through their social media with them and talk to them about what they are saying on Snapchat, in group chats,\" said Kat Cohen, founder and CEO of IvyWise, an educational consultancy firm for college admissions. \"Because, if the information comes off as being radical or anti-American in some way, it is not going to help them.\"",
      "The focus on international students' online profiles follows a new push by the Trump administration to scrutinize social media accounts as part of the evaluation process for student visa applications. In a cable dated May 27 and obtained by CBS News, the State Department said it was preparing to expand social media screening and vetting. The agency did not specify exactly what type of content it would be looking for.",
      "\"President Trump will always put the safety of Americans first, and it is a privilege, not a right, to study in the United States,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \"Enhanced social media vetting is a commonsense measure that will help ensure that guests in our country are not planning to harm Americans, which is a national security priority.\"",
      "The new vetting measures build upon an April\u00a0statement\u00a0from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announcing that the agency will be taking into account \"antisemitic activity on social media\" as \"grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.\"",
      "No politics",
      "Advisers who cater to international students applying to U.S. schools told CBS Moneywatch they are reluctant to advise them to delete their social media accounts outright. But they are urging students to eliminate political-themed posts, especially if they relate to controversial topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. IvyWise also discourages foreign students from reposting any information they haven't verified themselves, given that it might be inaccurate.",
      "\"We don't think students should delete their social media accounts completely,\" Cohen said. \"But we do need to make sure we go through their social media accounts with them to make sure that they are presenting themselves in the best possible light.\"",
      "Mandee Heller Adler, founder of International College Counselors, also recommends that students weed out potentially controversial posts, including any opinions or content related to politics.",
      "\"I'm not saying that they have to get rid of the whole thing altogether, but certainly delete any political posts,\" Adler told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is kind of an easy way for kids to protect themselves.\"",
      "Sasha Chada, who has led Texas-based college admissions counseling group Ivy Scholars for over a decade, said that asking students to delete their social media would be a \"tall order\" given how deeply ingrained the platforms are in their lives. People aged 18 to 24, for example, make up the largest share of Instagram users worldwide, at 32%, according to Sprout Social, a social media management platform.",
      "Chilling effect?",
      "Some critics think the State Department's scrutiny of international students' social accounts will inhibit their freedom of expression.",
      "\"While social media vetting of visa applicants isn't new, should the administration's 'expanded vetting' consider political viewpoints, it will certainly scare some would-be applicants into silencing themselves on any topic they feel might contradict the views of President Trump, or his successors,\" said Robert Shibley, special counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which promotes free speech on college campuses.",
      "The State Department did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters this week, when asked about student visas.",
      "Mahsa Khanbabai, an immigration attorney based in Massachusetts whose firm assists with student visas, said she has spoken to dozens of foreign students \u2014 both overseas and in the U.S. \u2014 some of whom have decided to delete their social media accounts or change them from public to private for protection.",
      "Students, she said, are not just concerned about posts on political flashpoints like Gaza, but also their personal views on topics like climate change and reproductive rights advocacy. Recent consultations Khanbabai has had with foreign students have been focused, she said, on helping them determine how strongly they feel about publicizing their views, and giving them a sense of the potential trade-offs when deciding to post or not to post.",
      "\"I meet with students to ask them, 'Are you willing to pause engagement on social media to achieve longer-term goals like your career and education, knowing that in the short term you're ultimately kind of maybe sacrificing some of your ethical or moral values?'\" she said.",

      "McAllen, Texas, located on the state's southern tip, claimed the No. 1 spot on SmartAsset's list.

      "While Midwestern cities ranked higher in affordability than others, only Lawton, Oklahoma, where homes have a median sale price of $150,007, made it into SmartAsset's top 10 cities for first-time homebuyers overall.",
      "Best place for expanded inventory",
      "One of biggest issues plaguing the housing market is the limited supply of homes for sale While studies show\u00a0that the inventory of available properties is rising in many markets, some metro areas are still suffering from\u00a0shortages, which increases competition and prices for homebuyers.",

      "With a big majority still saying their incomes don't keep pace with inflation, prices and finances of course play a big role in how Americans decide what their summer plans will be. And that, too, helps define two different outlooks heading into the season.",
      "Slightly more Americans say they'll take a vacation this summer than report taking one in 2024. Most likely to take a vacation are the just-over half who say they're at least doing OK financially and can keep up with expenses. (For the higher income earners among them especially, summer will also involve travel.)",
      "But for those who say their finances are not good, it continues to be largely because of prices and incomes not keeping up with inflation. They're largely forgoing any vacation or travel.",

That's especially the case among those whose personal financial situation isn't good.",

      "Those in comparably lower income levels report feeling stress about finances more often. Stress and concern go up with feeling less secure in a job (for those employed.) Concern about monthly ability to pay for food and groceries is strongly associated with more frequent feelings of stress. Conversely, feelings of being secure or optimistic financially are linked to confidence in being able to save, buy extras and pay for the basics.",

      "Large majorities, often even if their finances are ok, say their incomes are not keeping pace with inflation, and this generally hasn't changed over time.",

    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday froze the April 2 tariffs imposed by President Trump on almost every foreign nation. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods imported from almost every foreign nation have been ruled illegal\u00a0by the U.S. Court of International Trade, marking a setback for the president's trade agenda \u2014 and adding another level of uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses.",
      "However, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision, reinstating the levies for now. Its order said that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay, and gave the plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to respond to the administration.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from the court halted the tariffs\u00a0Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every other country on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day.\" Some trading partners faced substantially higher import duties, with the president hiking tariffs on China-produced goods to as high as 145% before easing them temporarily earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump's trade agenda hinges on wide-ranging tariffs that he has promised will help bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs while also raising trillions in new revenue for federal coffers. The trade court decision could provide a measure of relief to American businesses and consumers, given that they're typically on the hook for paying the tariffs when imports reach U.S. soil. However, the federal appeal's decision on Thursday to reinstate the duties adds more uncertainty over tariffs.",
      "As the Trump administration's appeal works its way through the courts, it's unclear whether business should ultimately plan for relief if the trade court's ruling stands, or whether the tariffs might stick. And Mr. Trump could seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs, experts say.",
      "\"At the moment, it is anyone's guess as to whether these very unpopular tariffs will be reinstated on appeal or by the Supreme Court,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a May 29 research note. \"So, uncertainty is now poised to escalate.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's tariffs following the ruling.",
      "Are any of Mr. Trump's tariffs still in effect?",
      "With the temporary stay imposed by the appeals court, all of his tariffs are \u2014 at least for now \u2014 still in effect.",
      "But the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling applies to the Trump administration's tariffs that were issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The Trump administration has also levied additional import duties by tapping other trade rules, and those remain in effect.",
      "\"The tariffs that remain in place are the Section 232 tariffs of 25% on automotive, steel and aluminum imports and the Section 301 tariffs on China that were imposed during President Trump's first term and expanded under the Biden administration,\" analysts at research company Capital Economics noted in a May 29 note.",
      "The president cited the IEEPA to announce the so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2. At the time of the announcement, Mr. Trump said that trade deficits with other nations represented \"a national emergency.\"",
      "But the court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's global tariffs aren't authorized by the IEEPA, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "Could Mr. Trump reinstate the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump could reinstate the tariffs if he wins on appeal, but his administration could also seek other routes to reimpose the import duties, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "For instance, the president could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs of up to 15%, but they would be limited to 150 days, according to Goldman Sachs. A section of the Trade Act of 1930 would allow the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from nations that discriminate against the U.S., they added.",
      "\"Section 232 tariffs, which President Trump has already used for steel, aluminum and autos, could be broadened to cover other sectors,\" they noted.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration had other tariff measures available that would take a few months to put in place. He added, \"But we're not planning on pursuing those right now because we are confident this ruling is incorrect,\" Hassett said.",
      "What about other lawsuits targeting the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are being challenged in a number of other lawsuits, including one filed by a family-owned toy company called Learning Resources. Its CEO, Rick Woldenberg, had told CBS MoneyWatch in April that he was suing because he believed the tariffs would prove catastrophic, both for his business and the U.S. economy.",
      "On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in favor of Learning Resources, writing in his decision that the IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose the tariffs.\" The judge also blocked the Trump administration from collecting tariffs from the toy maker and its sibling business, hand2mind, writing that the companies were likely to suffer \"significant and unrecoverable losses.\"",
      "Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch on Thursday that while the court's decision was \"gratifying,\" he's still facing uncertainty over the ongoing threat of tariffs because he expects the Trump administration to appeal the ruling.",
      "\"There is going to be a lot of dust in the air for the next two weeks as 'emergency this' and 'emergency that' are filed all over the place,\" he said. \"For things to change in our business, we need some certainty on our costs.\"",
      "What does this mean for U.S. businesses and consumers?",
      "Until the appeal is resolved, there will be some added level of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the tariffs when imported goods reach U.S. ports, some economists said on Thursday.",
      "Most or all of the tariffs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say, which has prompted them to forecast higher inflation in 2025. If the trade court's decision is upheld, the effective tariff rate will ultimately be lowered, although it would still be significantly higher than it was prior to the current Trump administration.",
      "\"We calculate that the effective tariff rate is now 6.5%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year but far lower than the 15% rate based on our assumption of the IEEPA-related tariffs remaining in place,\" noted Capital Economics on Thursday, after the trade court's ruling but before the appeals court said the tariffs could remain in place temporarily.",
      "\"I hope this is a process that will lead to certainty,\" Learning Resources CEO Woldenberg said about the two court rulings. But, he added, \"until I know if it's going to stick, I can't plan around not paying the tariffs.\"",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief order that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now.",
      "A three-judge panel on the trade court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect.",
      "\"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the Federal Circuit to review the trade court's decision and also requested it halt that ruling while it considers the appeal.

      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",

The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",

      "(UPDATE: The ruling has been temporarily halted by an appeals court - read more here.)",
      "The ruling \u2014 issued by a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade \u2014 halted the sweeping 10% tariffs Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner on \"Liberation Day\" last month, with higher tariffs threatened for dozens of countries. The court also blocked a separate set of tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada by the Trump administration, which has cited drug trafficking and illegal immigration as its reasoning for the hikes.",
      "Global markets rallied on the news.",
      "The Trump administration has justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during certain emergency situations. But the court on Wednesday rejected the government's interpretation of the law, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "The court said Mr. Trump's global 10% tariffs aren't authorized by IEEPA because they're designed to deal with trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world, which the judges said should fall under non-emergency legislation.",
      "And the China, Canada and Mexico tariffs aren't legal because they \"do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders,\" the court also found.",
      "The three judges who wrote Wednesday's ruling were nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, former President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "\"It's great to see that the court unanimously ruled against this massive power grab by the President. The ruling emphasizes that he was wrong to claim a virtually unlimited power to impose tariffs, that IEEPA law doesn't grant any such boundless authority, and that it would be unconstitutional if it did.\" Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University involved in one of the lawsuits before the U.S. Court of International Trade, said in a statement.",
      "Following the decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs deriving from a series of executive orders invoking IEEPA are unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras found that the law \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in five of his orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the plaintiffs in the case, two family-owned businesses based in Illinois. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a 33-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",
      "The Trump administration said in court papers with the trade court that it will appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The Justice Department has said that if the appeals court declines to provide interim relief in the coming hours, the U.S. will ask the Supreme Court to intervene Friday.",
      "\"Absent at least interim relief from this Court, the United States plans to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court tomorrow to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake,\" the Justice Department filing said.",
      "The department has also asked the U.S. Court of International Trade to pause enforcement of its ruling pending appeal. That court has given the states and small businesses until Friday at 12 p.m. to respond to the government's stay request.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\"",
      "\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement.",
      "Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries were paused in April for a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from 25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods have also been cut back amid negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states.",
      "Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrines long championed by conservative lawyers and judges to restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.",
      "\"If this issue gets to the Supreme Court, which is a big if, and if it comes down to the major questions doctrine or the nondelegation doctrine, and those are big ifs as well, we believe the court's precedent requires them to rule in our favor,\" Somin\u00a0told CBS News earlier this month.",

      "Read on to learn more about the Court of International Trade and how it operates.",
      "What is the Court of International Trade?",
      "Located in downtown Manhattan, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or CIT, is a federal court that focuses on international trade issues. It resolves disputes between governments, manufacturers, trade associations and other parties that may be privy to trade dealings.",
      "According to the CIT's\u00a0website, the court serves as the main judicial forum for resolving civil actions related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade. In that role, the CIT helps avoid jurisdictional conflicts on trade matters that might arise among other federal courts.",
      "The Court of International Trade was created\u00a0as part of the the Customs Court Act of 1980, which reorganized the U.S. Customs Court into the CIT. The new court was established under Article III of the Constitution and has jurisdiction over any trade-related issues arising in the U.S. It is also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries, according the court's website.",
      "The courthouse is located at One Federal Plaza in New York City.",
      "How many judges sit on the court?",
      "Nine judges sit on the Court of International Trade, all of whom are appointed for life. Those judges are chosen by the U.S. president, but the Senate must consent to those selections. According to the rules of the court, no more than five judges can be from the same political party.",
      "Currently, the court's chief judge is Mark Barnett. He appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013 and began his post as chief judge in 2021, according to his bio page on the court's website.",
      "Which judges stuck down the Trump tariffs?",
      "Three CIT judges rules that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in imposing the tariffs: Judge Timothy Reif, who was nominated by Mr. Trump; Judge Jane Restani, who was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Gary Katzmann, who was nominated by former President Obama.",
      "How do rulings work?",
      "Typically, the CIT's chief judge assigns cases to a specific judge. In certain instances, including when the case involves a presidential executive order or if it has broad legal implications for customs laws, the chief judge can assign it to a three-judge panel. Cases are then decided by a majority of judges.",
      "In Wednesday's decision, the judges unanimously ruled to block the Trump administration tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Although the CIT is in New York, the court's judges have nationwide jurisdiction and preside over cases across the U.S. If a case is appealed, as it was in this instance, it then moves the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. and, potentially, to the Supreme Court.",
      "What types of cases does the court rule on?",
      "The Court of International Trade resolves trade disputes by interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, such as the Tariff Act of 1930. One example would be enforcing anti-dumping or countervailing duties, which protect domestic manufacturers by preventing foreign companies from selling goods at prices below market value.",
      "The court rules on dozens of cases each year. So far this year, it has issued 66 opinions.",

    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 15:41:02 -0400",
    "summary": "New delinquency reports will hurt the credit scores of borrowers who fail to make payments on their student loans.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's resumption of student loan payments earlier this month is taking a toll on many borrowers' credit records.",
      "Credit scores dropped by more than 100 points for 2.2 million delinquent student loan borrowers from January through March of 2025, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For its report, the Fed looked at a borrower delinquency rate based on shares of student loan borrowers with at least one student loan reported as past due or in default.",
      "Another 1 million borrowers experienced credit score drops of at least 150 points for the first three months of 2025. A low credit score makes securing future loans both more difficult and more costly, pushing milestones like buying a home, or saving for retirement, further out of reach. It can even impact one's employment prospects.",
      "\"The key risk is that this could lead to reduced credit limits and higher interest rates for new loans, which could reduce delinquent borrowers' access to credit, which would then be used for other areas of spending such as on cars and mortgages,\" Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some 2.4 million of the newly delinquent borrowers previously had credit scores above 620, which are considered good and would have allowed them to qualify for new car loans, mortgages and credit cards before the delinquencies were reported, Fed researchers said.",
      "\"These borrowers saw substantial declines in their credit standing in the first quarter and will now face steeper borrowing costs or denial for new credit,\" Fed researchers said in the report.",
      "Grace period expires",
      "Student loan repayments were paused at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by President Trump in March 2020, during his first term. After multiple extensions of the payment pause by former President Biden, repayments resumed in October 2023.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education then instituted a 12-month \"on ramp\" period which expired in October 2024, to give student borrowers some leniency as they resumed payments. During the transition period, loan servicers did not report missed payments or delinquent loans to credit bureaus, protecting many student borrowers from the worst consequences of not making their payments. Borrowers are considered delinquent on their loans when a payment is more than 90 days late.",
      "The pandemic-era pause on repayment had a positive effect on borrowers' credit scores: Between 2019 and 2024, the number of borrowers with credit scores below 620 fell by more than 4 million, as borrowers moved into higher credit score brackets, an analysis from Oxford economics shows.",
      "With that grace period having ended on May 5, newly delinquent student borrowers' credit scores are also being dinged, as their failures to pay back their debts are reported to credit bureaus.",
      "\"Borrowers receiving a new delinquency will see a drop in their credit score. This may signal a reversal of the positive credit score trend seen during the pandemic, which would lead to reduced credit limits and higher interest rates for new loans,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in a report.",
      "Long-lasting consequences",
      "Substantial drops in delinquent student borrowers' credit scores will have long-lasting ramifications for those affected, including lower credit limits, higher interest rates for new loans and limited access to credit in general, according to experts.",
      "\"The long-term issue is they'll have trouble accessing other types of loans in the future, like mortgage and car loans. It's easier to build credit scores when you don't have negative data, but when you have a delinquency, it's hard to come out of that. It takes a lot of effort,\" Tushar Bagamane, CEO of budgeting tool Vola Finance, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Consumers with multiple delinquencies report having to pay \"exorbitantly high on interest\" on larger loans once a delinquency impacts their credit score, Bagamane said.",
      "\"They have to pay more on their home loans and the cost of those lines of credit affects the income they have left after meeting their essential needs,\" he said. \"The ability to refinance existing loans with a low credit score can be prohibitively expensive and at that point, borrowers are almost left outside the financial system.\"",
      "By that he means they can't achieve milestones like owning a home or acquiring other assets, \"which is not a good position to be in,\" Bagamane added.",
      "American dream increasingly out of sight",
      "Zwemmer, of Oxford Economics, noted that a delinquency remains on one's credit report for seven years, and so avoiding becoming delinquent on a loan in the first place is the best course of action. If millions of student borrowers drop into lower credit score brackets, it could exacerbate the divide between low-income and higher-income Americans.",
      "\"Older and lower-income segments of the population will be most impacted, so we'll be looking to see if there's a further bifurcation of U.S. consumers,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "Jason Ackerman, a certified public accountant and co-founder of WealthRabbit, a retirement planning platform, said that as their credit scores drop, those who can least afford to shoulder higher borrowing costs will see their rates rise.",
      "\"Younger people are getting further behind on the American dream of buying a house and saving for retirement,\" Ackerman told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Their payments get higher \u2014 and the more you're putting toward student loans, the less you can put toward other things.\"",

      "It doesn't take $1 million to achieve the top predictor of financial well-being, according to new research from investment firm Vanguard. Instead, it's something far more attainable: Socking away at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account.",
      "A survey of more than 12,000 Vanguard investors found that it's not assets or income that is most associated with a higher level of financial well-being, but rather $2,000 worth of emergency savings. Having that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while an income of $500,000 increased well-being by 12%, and assets of $1 million or more boosted well-being by 18%.",
      "A sense of financial well-being signifies that an adult can fully meet their financial obligations and are secure in their financial future, allowing them to make choices to enjoy their life, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The findings come as many Americans are feeling more financially stressed, with a separate study from Primerica finding that about half of middle-class households expect to be worse off financially in 2026, almost double the share in December, due to worries about the cost of living and the economy. Taking small steps to build an emergency savings account could prove to help alleviate financial anxiety, noted Paulo Costa, a behavioral economist and certified financial planner at Vanguard who co-authored the research.",
      "\"What's so powerful about this research is that it's not about gathering a lot of money to have that peace of mind,\" Costa told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That initial $2,000 makes a big difference.\"",
      "While it may seem that having $1 million in assets should boost financial well-being more than $2,000 in a savings account, the results show the importance of being prepared for an unplanned expense, Costa added. (To be sure, most people in the study had $2,000 in emergency savings \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 versus $1 million in assets, at about 3 in 10.)",
      "The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, which means having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, he said.",
      "\"When is $2,000 more than a million dollars? It's when it comes to emergency savings,\" Costa said. \"The point of emergency savings is to have that money readily available if you need it. A lot of people have money, for example, in retirement accounts that may have some requirements about when you can withdraw that money and may have some tax consequences and some penalties.\"",
      "Retirement assets are generally not readily available to cover unexpected expenses, with people younger than 59 1/2 incurring a 10% penalty for taking out money. But having $2,000 set aside in a bank account means that you've got the peace of mind that you'll be able to handle a surprise car repair or medical bill.",
      "And people with $2,000 in emergency savings typically spend about 2 hours less each week thinking about their finances versus those without any savings, the study found.",
      "How many people can handle emergency expenses?",
      "To be sure, obtaining $2,000 in savings could prove out of reach for many Americans, especially those who are low income, struggling with debt or who reside in an area with a high cost of living. Vanguard's survey includes only people who have investment accounts at the company, which signals they have access to 401(k)s and other types of investment accounts that many Americans lack.",
      "Almost 4 in 10 Americans say they don't have the cash on hand to pay for a $400 emergency expense, according to research from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Still, more Americans appear to be socking away money for a rainy day, with the Primerica study finding that 64% of those surveyed in March said they had an emergency fund of at least $1,000, up from 58% two years earlier.",
      "Even if saving $2,000 seems out of reach, you can start small by saving as little as $10 a week, Costa said. The best idea is to find a strategy that works for you, whether that's budgeting or automating savings by directing a certain amount into a dedicated account with each paycheck, he said.",
      "\"I love the idea of, 'out of sight, out of mind,' so when you get paid, you immediately send money to your savings account,\" he said. \"By saving $50 per week, you will build up to $2,000 in less than a year.\"",
      "He added, \"Saving something is better than saving nothing. So just getting started, that really makes a big difference.\"",

    "summary": "GOP Rep. Michael Bost and two Republican presidential electors challenged Illinois' decision to count mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether to revive a Republican congressman's challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day.",
      "The dispute involving GOP Rep. Michael Bost will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term, which begins in October, with a decision expected by the end of June 2026. The question in the case is a procedural one: Whether Bost and two Republican presidential electors have the legal right to challenge state regulations concerning the time, place and manner of federal elections.",
      "If the high court finds that the plaintiffs do have the legal standing to sue, their lawsuit could proceed.",
      "The case concerns an Illinois law that dictates when vote-by-mail ballots have to be postmarked and received in order for them to be counted. Changes in state law in 2005 effectively allow a mail-in ballot received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted as long as it is cast by mail on or before the day of the election. At least 17 states also allow ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted.",
      "Bost, who was first elected to Congress in 2014, and two Republican presidential electors sued Illinois election officials over the deadline for counting mail ballots in 2022. They argued in part that the receipt and counting of late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes, infringing on their rights under the First and 14th Amendments, and contended that the ballot-receipt deadline is preempted by two federal statutes that set a uniform day for federal elections.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the case in 2023, finding that Bost and the two electors failed to allege that they have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing. A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the district court's decision last year, agreeing that the plaintiffs did not allege standing to bring their lawsuit because they did not plausibly allege they had been injured by the law involving late-arriving mail ballots.",
      "Bost and the electors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that in recent years, the ability of candidates and parties to sue over state laws that affect their campaigns has been restricted by the federal courts.",
      "\"The court's guidance is needed to correct the unwarranted narrowing of candidates' ability to challenge electoral regulations,\" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court, adding that it is \"vitally important\" for the Supreme Court to clarify whether candidates can challenge state election laws in federal court.",
      "\"It is important that courts hear and resolve well-pleaded challenges by federal candidates to state time, place, and manner regulations affecting their elections,\" the Republicans wrote. \"Aside from the interests of the litigants, it is important that the public conclude that elections are run in an orderly, not arbitrary, fashion.\"",
      "But Illinois election officials urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal, arguing that the plaintiffs disagree with their decision to count mail-in ballots that are cast on or before Election Day, but arrive after.",
      "\"They do not claim that Illinois's ballot receipt deadline affected their likelihood of prevailing in any race in which they have ever competed or are likely to compete in the future,\" the state officials said in a filing with the high court. \"Rather, petitioners contend that they are entitled to challenge the deadline simply by virtue of their status as candidates, on the theory that a political candidate can always challenge a state's regulation of the time, place, and manner of conducting an election.\"",

      "China on Monday said the Trump administration is undermining the temporary\u00a0May 12 trade agreement between the two nations by issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and by planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "The Trump administration's actions \"seriously undermine the existing consensus reached at the Geneva economic and trade talks, and seriously damage China's legitimate rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in the June 2 statement.",
      "China's claims come after President Trump on Friday said that Beijing is violating a trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after the two countries announced on May 12 a\u00a0temporary but significant easing\u00a0of tariffs imposed on each other's imports earlier in the year. The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",
      "He added, \"The overall objectives of the trade aggression, other than the display of raw power, are as muddled as ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said he's \"confident\" a U.S.-China trade dispute \"will be ironed out\" when Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a conversation. \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\"\u00a0Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Wall Street was lower on Monday amid renewed concerns of a brewing trade war between the nations. The S&P 500 slipped 10 points, or 0.2%, to 5,901, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shed 0.1%.",
      "May 12 tariff pause",
      "The May 12 deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause still leaves tariffs higher than before Mr. Trump\u00a0started ramping them up\u00a0last month. Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",
      "\"If the United States and China were to disengage completely in another blitz of escalating tariffs, it would be a really big deal for the global economy,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a client note. \"Demand for industrial commodities would plummet.

    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:15:34 -0400",
    "summary": "In declining to take up the case, the Supreme Court leaves intact a lower court decision upholding Maryland's ban on certain semiautomatic rifles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge to Maryland's ban on so-called assault weapons, leaving intact a lower court ruling that upheld the law.",
      "In declining to review the decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, the high court skirts for now a fight over whether the Second Amendment allows states to regulate the rifles that have been used in a wave of mass shootings. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision to turn away the case.",
      "The Supreme Court had already turned away the legal battle over Maryland's law last year because a federal appeals court had yet to rule. But the 4th Circuit upheld the measure last August, finding that weapons like the AR-15 could be banned in part because they are outside the scope of the Second Amendment.",
      "But the question of whether AR-15s are protected by the Second Amendment is likely to be soon decided by the Supreme Court. In a separate statement, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the issue is currently being considered by other federal appeals courts, and rulings from them \"should assist this court's ultimate decisionmaking.\" He predicted appeals to the Supreme Court will be before the court \"shortly,\" and said the justices \"should and presumably will address the AR-15 issue soon, in the next term or two.\"",
      "In addition to rejecting the appeal of Maryland's prohibition, the Supreme Court declined to consider a challenge to Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines, keeping the law in place. The court's decision to turn away the appeal from four gun owners and a firearms dealer leaves intact a lower court ruling that declined to block enforcement of Rhode Island's ban and found the challengers failed to show they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.",
      "The two disputes are among several to land before the Supreme Court following its June 2022 ruling that expanded the right to bear arms and laid out a new framework for determining when restrictions on firearms adhere to the Constitution.",
      "Under its new standard, the government must show that a measure is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation and is therefore allowed under the Second Amendment. The high court provided some clarification about its so-called historical tradition test in its last term when it upheld a federal law that bars alleged domestic abusers from temporarily having firearms, but courts have still struggled to apply the framework, leading to conflicting decisions on the constitutionality of longstanding gun laws.",
      "Maryland's assault-weapons ban",
      "Maryland's prohibition on certain semiautomatic rifles was enacted in the wake of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Under the law, it is a crime to possess, sell, transfer or purchase an \"assault long gun\" or a \"copycat weapon,\" which encompasses 45 specific guns or their analogues. A variety of semiautomatic handguns and rifles are still allowed, according to the Maryland State Police.",
      "In addition to Maryland, eight other states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws restricting semiautomatic weapons.",
      "A group of Maryland residents who want to buy rifles covered by the ban, a licensed gun dealer in the state and several pro-Second Amendment groups challenged the law in 2020, arguing that they have a Second Amendment right to own common assault rifles.",
      "The federal district court and U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the law, likening the banned firearms to the M-16 rifle, which the Supreme Court has said is outside the scope of Second Amendment protection.",
      "The Maryland challengers asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court put consideration on hold while it decided another gun case involving concealed carry rules in New York. In that ruling issued in June 2022, the Supreme Court laid out the new framework under which gun laws must be consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "Following its decision in that landmark gun case, the Supreme Court sent the challenge to Maryland's assault weapons back to the appeals court to reconsider the case.",
      "After applying that new framework to Maryland's ban, the 4th Circuit concluded last year that the assault weapons ban is constitutional. Focusing on the AR-15 in particular, the appeals court found that it is most useful in military service and can be banned consistent with the Second Amendment.",
      "It also rejected the challengers' contention that because the guns covered by Maryland's ban are commonly used, they are protected by the Constitution. Instead, the 4th Circuit said adopting this argument would mean that any dangerous weapon \"could gain constitutional protection merely because it becomes popular before the government can sufficiently regulate it.\"",
      "The appeals court also said that the ban is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation, as it \"is one of many in a storied tradition of legislatures perceiving threats posed by excessively dangerous weapons and regulating commensurately.\"",
      "The challengers again sought the Supreme Court's review, arguing in a filing that the justices should \"ensure that the Second Amendment itself is not truncated into a limited right to own certain state-approved means of personal self-defense.\"",
      "They argued the AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the U.S. and said the 4th Circuit's ruling \"turns a firearm possessed for lawful purposes by millions of Americans into an item with not even presumptive constitutional protection.\"",
      "But Maryland officials urged the court to leave the 4th Circuit's ruling intact, in part because they said it's too soon for the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "In his statement, Kavanaugh called the appeals court's decision \"questionable.\"",
      "\"Given that millions of Americans own AR-15s and that a significant majority of the states allow possession of those rifles, petitioners have a strong argument that AR-15s are in 'common use' by law-abiding citizens and therefore are protected by the Second Amendment,\" he wrote. \"If so, then the Fourth Circuit would have erred by holding that Maryland's ban on AR\u201315s complies with the Second Amendment.\"",
      "Thomas, in a solo dissent, said the Supreme Court should not wait to decide the constitutionality of laws outlawing AR-15s and lamented that the justices have put off addressing it for a decade.",
      "\"[F]urther percolation is of little value when lower courts in the jurisdictions that ban AR-15s appear bent on distorting this court's Second Amendment precedents,\" he wrote. \"I doubt we would sit idly by if lower courts were to so subvert our precedents involving any other constitutional right. Until we are vigilant in enforcing it, the right to bear arms will remain 'a second-class right.'\"",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines was enacted by its General Assembly in June 2022 in response to mass shootings that have upended communities nationwide in recent years. The law prohibits possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.",
      "People who had these magazines had six months to either modify them to accept no more than 10 rounds, sell them to a firearms dealer, take them out of state or turn them into law enforcement. Possession of large-capacity magazines is now considered a felony.",
      "The group of gun owners challenged the state's ban shortly before it was set to take effect, arguing it violated the Second Amendment. A federal district court judge denied the challengers' request to block the law, finding that keeping large-capacity magazines isn't conduct that is protected by the Second Amendment.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit then upheld the district court's decision, finding that the ban \"imposes no meaningful burden on the ability of Rhode Island residents to defend themselves.\" The three-judge appeals court panel also said that semiautomatic weapons outfitted with large-capacity magazines \"much more closely resemble\" the M-16 rifle, which is banned for civilian use, than traditional handguns.",
      "\"The burden on self-defense imposed by [Rhode Island's law] is no greater than the burdens of longstanding, permissible arms regulations, and its justification compares favorably with the justification for prior bans on other arms found to pose growing threats to public safety,\" the court said. It added that, when applying the Supreme Court's framework, \"our analogical reasoning very likely places LCMs well within the realm of devices that have historically been prohibited once their danger became manifest.\"",
      "The gun owners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lower courts have \"rubber-stamped\" firearms restrictions even in the wake of the high court's more recent decisions.",
      "\"The same law-abiding citizens who were unconstitutionally deprived of their right to carry arms outside the home before Bruen continue to be deprived of their right to keep arms that are common in the rest of the country,\" they wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court, citing the court's Jun 2022 decision. \"The result is a nation that remains split, with the Second Amendment alive and well in (most of) the vast middle, but routinely disregarded near the coasts.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials urged the Supreme Court to reject the case, saying it is not worthy of the court's attention \"at this time.\" They noted in a filing that the case arrived at the high court while proceedings are still in preliminary stages.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-senators-change-in-trumps-house-passed-one-big-beautiful-bill/",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 08:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The bill containing Trump's tax cuts and border and defense spending is expected to face some hurdles in the Senate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate this week is taking up the massive budget package containing President Trump's second-term agenda, a measure that squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. Its path through the Senate seems destined to be similarly narrow, with the package almost certain to be revised, since parts of it are opposed by a handful of GOP senators critical to its passage.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, recently ventured to the other side of the U.S. Capitol to remind Republican senators \"that we are one team\" and pleaded with them to keep the bill substantially intact.",
      "\"I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House,\" Johnson said in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, acknowledged that balance, but told reporters \"the Senate will have its imprint\" on the bill. He can afford three \"no\" votes from Republicans if all Democrats vote to block its passage in the Senate, and there are no absences.",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has already indicated he opposes the bill because it will \"explode the debt.\" Including interest, the House bill would increase the debt by $3.1 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Similar to the House, in the Senate, there are Republicans who think there's not enough cost cutting, while others argue some provisions are too draconian.",
      "These are the key sticking points as the legislation moves to the Senate:",
      "Medicaid changes",
      "Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Josh Hawley of Missouri are among the Republicans who have expressed concern about some of the changes to Medicaid, a government program that provides health care to low-income Americans as well as those with disabilities. And the trio of senators supported an amendment to the budget resolution earlier this year that would have removed the language instructing the committee overseeing Medicaid to make $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.",
      "The House-passed legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. It also requires states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and it would penalize states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. The bill also seeks to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes, among other changes.",
      "While these Senate Republicans have generally been supportive of the work requirements, some have warned that they will not support the bill if it includes any cuts to Medicaid benefits.",
      "In a New York Times opinion piece published earlier this month, Hawley called \"slashing health insurance for the working poor\" both \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\"",
      "A handful of senators have also warned of the impact of freezing provider taxes at current levels, since states use the taxes to help fund their share of Medicaid costs, although Murkowski has expressed support for this. Hawley said he's concerned about the impact on rural hospitals, while also voicing opposition to new copay requirements for beneficiaries.",
      "\"I don't like the idea of decreasing funding for rural hospitals. I'm worried that the House bill goes way too far in that regard,\" Hawley said in a CNN interview. \"I also don't like what is basically a hidden tax on working poor people who are trying to get health care. I mean, this whole idea of we're going to charge them now additional copays in order to access healthcare \u2014 I have to say, that just sounds like a tax to me.\"",
      "Deeper spending cuts",
      "Meanwhile, a number of fiscal hawks have balked at the bill's spending cuts or even threatened to oppose the measure without securing deeper cuts, echoing the frustration expressed on the other side of the Capitol by members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus throughout negotiations on the package.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said the package's aim to cut $1.5 trillion \"isn't squat, quite honestly.\" And Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has also rebuffed the cuts, saying the amount is \"not going to do it.\"",
      "\"Their bill would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it,\" Scott told reporters earlier this month, adding that the upper chamber should go through every line in the budget to find savings.",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said \"the job of the Senate is to try to increase the cuts in spending,\" calling the House cuts a \"great start\" while urging the Senate to hit $2 trillion. And Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told the network that he believes \"the Senate is going to cut spending more than the House.\"",
      "\"We're going to see the Senate be more fiscally conservative,\" Cruz added.",
      "Rolling back IRA clean energy tax credits",
      "The House-passed bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, including an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. But the provisions could face opposition in the upper chamber.",
      "Last month, Murkowksi, along with GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, penned a letter to the Senate majority leader to \"emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.\"",
      "\"While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,\" the group wrote.",
      "Tillis told reporters after the House passed the bill that the Senate needs to \"look at the specifics\" of revising the clean energy tax credits, saying \"we've got to make sure the businesses who believe the government was setting this as a priority don't have a lot of stranded costs.\"",
      "At the same time, other Senate Republicans, like Johnson, have called for eliminating the clean energy tax credits, setting up a possible clash within the conference.",
      "State and local tax deduction",
      "Among the provisions that spurred extensive debate in the House was one allowing residents to deduct more in state and local taxes on their federal returns, known as SALT. Divisions over an increase to the SALT cap threatened to sink the package in the days leading up to its passage in the lower chamber as a handful of blue-state Republicans fought for a higher cap, ultimately settling for $40,000, an increase from $10,000.",
      "In the Senate, the deduction is not an issue, since none of the blue states have Republican senators. Accordingly, a number of Senate Republicans have indicated that they oppose its inclusion in the bill.",
      "\"Eliminate it,\" Johnson, the Wisconsin senator, told reporters of the SALT cap increase.",
      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told The Hill that the cap could potentially be cut in half once the Senate makes its changes.",
      "But the House speaker said he warned senators that changing the provision would not only risk getting it through the lower chamber again, but also the Republican majority.",
      "\"In the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents,\" the Louisiana Republican told \"Face the Nation.\" \"Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House, and so, this is political reality.\"",
      "Debt ceiling",
      "Fiscal hawks are also unhappy with the inclusion of a provision raising the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. The debate comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act.",
      "Paul has been the most vocal in opposing an increase to the debt limit. The Kentucky Republican has said \"there's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before.\" Paul said he could be convinced to support the package if the debt ceiling provision is removed and voted on separately.",
      "Instead, Paul has proposed a short-term increase of $500 billion, raising the debt ceiling for a matter of months, which he said would allow conservatives to verify that spending cuts have actually been implemented before approving a further hike.",
      "\"If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?\" Paul said\u00a0Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"",
      "Paul's Senate colleague, Johnson, also backs splitting the package into multiple parts, as well as a smaller, short-term extension.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The package also cuts billions in federal dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The change will require states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries. Currently, the program is fully funded by the federal government, although states take on some of the cost to administer it. Beginning in 2028, states will have to chip in for the program as well.",
      "\"That's something that I heard some members voice concern about,\" Sen. John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, said before Memorial Day. \"So, we'll need to address that.\"",

    "summary": "The House passed President Trump's \"one, big, beautiful bill,\" which includes continuing the 2017 tax cuts, but several GOP senators have voiced concerns.",
    "story": [
      "A leading GOP friendly group supporting President Trump's \"one, big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0 is readying a $4 million advertising buy aimed at helping steer the effort through the Senate after a number of Republicans voiced concerns about the legislation as it stands.",
      "The plans from Americans for Prosperity, first reported on by CBS News, come as the GOP-controlled Senate is expected to focus on the sprawling bill key to Mr. Trump's agenda after it narrowly passed the Republican led-House last month.",
      "The messaging from AFP\u00a0 includes \"video and digital ads that will air on cable, connected TV, and other digital platforms,\" according to the organization. Television advertisements from the group will initially air in North Carolina, Louisiana, Maine, Idaho and the District of Columbia but could expand further.",
      "\"The sooner the Senate advances the bill, the sooner Americans start seeing relief where they need it most,\" said Brent Gardner, the organization's chief government affairs officer in a statement. The statement also noted the group is well aware that as the process being used to fast track the bill progressed \"the hill to climb was only going to get steeper.\"",
      "Crucial to the GOP bill is its continuation of key parts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was a legislative trademark of Mr. Trump's first term in office. But the expansive bill that passed the House also includes Medicaid work requirements, a raise of the debt ceiling and a bevy of other major measures that could prove politically difficult to pass even with the relatively strong GOP majority in the Senate.",
      "\"Look, I want to vote for it. I'm for the tax cuts. I voted for the tax cuts before. I want the tax cuts to be permanent, but at the same time, I don't want to raise the debt ceiling $5 trillion,\" Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The new advertising move from AFP include testimonials that show not only the impact of the 2017 tax cuts but also what could happen if Congress does not act soon to extend those earlier changes along with \"ads encouraging fiscal hawks in the Senate to find spending offsets by further eliminating wasteful Biden-era spending programs,\" according to details set to be released by AFP.",
      "Democrats in Congress have so far strongly resisted the Trump agenda legislation. While most legislation in the Senate typically requires bipartisan support because of the chamber's filibuster threshold, Republican leaders are using a procedural route that would allow them to pass the bill on the strength of their partisan majority alone. Already a messaging standoff has emerged around the bill that could play a major role in the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"Senate Republicans are doing everything in their power to rip away health care and spike costs for hardworking families, all to give billionaires a massive tax handout,\" Maeve Coyle, a spokesperson for the Senate Democrats campaign arm said in a recent statement. \"Under the leadership of Senate Republicans, millions of people are at risk of losing their health insurance \u2013 and voters will hold them accountable for it at the ballot box in 2026.\"",
      "The Republican Party doesn't need every one of its Senators to vote for the bill in order for it to pass due to the party's successful 2024 election that saw the right take back the majority in the chamber and finish with a total of 53 seats. But losing the support of just four GOP senators could doom the push.",
      "\"The Senate will have their differences, but focusing on where Republicans are unified is what will drive this bill forward \u2013 permanent tax cuts, energy abundance, secure borders, and the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse,\" Gardner, with Americans for Prosperity, said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. \u2014 Navajo Nation leaders took turns talking with the U.S. government's top health official as they hiked along a sandstone ridge overlooking their rural, high-desert town before the morning sun grew too hot.",
      "Buu Nygren, president of the Navajo Nation, paused at the edge with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Below them, tribal government buildings, homes, and juniper trees dotted the tan and deep-red landscape.",
      "Nygren said he wanted Kennedy to look at the capital for the nation of about 400,000 enrolled members. The tribal president pointed toward an antiquated health center that he hoped federal funding would help replace and described life for the thousands of locals without running water due to delayed government projects.",
      "Nygren said Kennedy had already done a lot, primarily saving the Indian Health Service from a round of staffing cuts rippling through the federal government.",
      "\"When we started hearing about the layoffs and the freezes, you were the first one to stand up for Indian Country,\" he told Kennedy, of his move to spare the federal agency charged with providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.",
      "But Nygren and other Navajo leaders said cuts to federal health programs outside the Indian Health Service are hurting Native Americans.",
      "\"You're disrupting real lives,\" Cherilyn Yazzie, a Navajo council delegate, told KFF Health News as she described recent changes.",
      "Kennedy has repeatedly promised to prioritize Native Americans' health care. But Native Americans and health officials across tribal nations say those overtures are overshadowed by the collateral harm from massive cuts to federal health programs.",
      "The sweeping reductions have resulted in cuts to funding directed toward or disproportionately relied on by Native Americans. Staffing cuts, tribal health leaders say, have led to missing data and poor communication.",
      "The Indian Health Service provides free health care at its hospitals and clinics to Native Americans, who, as a group, face higher rates of chronic diseases and die younger than other populations. Those inequities are attributable to centuries of systemic discrimination. But many tribal members don't live near an agency clinic or hospital. And those who do may face limited services, chronic underfunding, and staffing shortages. To work around those gaps, health organizations lean on other federally funded programs.",
      "\"There may be a misconception among some of the administration that Indian Country is only impacted by changes to the Indian Health Service,\" said Liz Malerba, a tribal policy expert and citizen of the Mohegan Tribe. \"That's simply not true.\"",
      "Tribes have lost more than $6 million in grants from other HHS agencies, the National Indian Health Board wrote in a May letter to Kennedy.",
      "Janet Alkire, chairperson of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the Dakotas, said at a May 14 Senate committee hearing that those grants paid for community health workers, vaccinations, data modernization, and other public health efforts.",
      "The government also canceled funding for programs it said violated President Trump's ban on \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" including one aimed at Native American youth interested in science and medicine and another that helps several tribes increase access to healthy food \u2014 something Kennedy has said he wants to prioritize.",
      "Tribal health officials say slashed federal staffing has made it harder to get technical support and money for federally funded health projects they run.",
      "The firings have cut or eliminated staff at programs related to preventing overdoses in tribal communities, using traditional food and medicine to fight chronic disease, and helping low-income people afford to heat and cool their homes through the Low Income Home Energy Program.",
      "The Oglala Sioux Tribe is in South Dakota, where Native Americans who struggle to heat their homes have died of hypothermia. Through mid-May the tribe hadn't been able to access its latest funding installment from the energy program, said John Long, the tribe's chief of staff.",
      "Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute at the Seattle Indian Health Board, said the government has sent her organization incomplete health data. That includes statistics about Native Americans at risk for suicide and substance use disorders, which the center uses to shape public health policy and programs.",
      "\"People are going to die because we don't have access to the data,\" Echo-Hawk said.",
      "Her organization is also having trouble administering a $2.2 million federal grant, she said, because the agency handling the money fired staffers she worked with. The grant pays for public health initiatives such as smoking cessation and vaccinations.",
      "\"It is very confusing to say chronic disease prevention is the No. 1 priority and then to eradicate the support needed to address chronic disease prevention in Indian Country,\" Echo-Hawk said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said Kennedy aims to combat chronic diseases and improve well-being among Native Americans \"through culturally relevant, community-driven solutions.\"",
      "Hilliard did not respond to questions about Kennedy's specific plans for Native American health or concerns about existing and proposed funding and staffing changes.",
      "As Kennedy hiked alongside Navajo Nation leaders, KFF Health News asked how he would improve and protect access to care for tribal communities amid rollbacks within his department.",
      "\"That's exactly what I'm doing,\" Kennedy responded. \"Making sure that all the cuts do not affect these communities.\"",
      "Kennedy has said his focus on Native American health stems from personal and family experience, something he repeated to Navajo leadership. As an attorney, he worked with tribes on environmental health lawsuits. He also served as an editor at ICT, a major Native American news outlet.",
      "The secretary said he was also influenced by his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, and his father, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who were both assassinated when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a child.",
      "\"They thought that America would never live up to its moral authority and its role as an exemplary nation around the world if we didn't first look back and remediate or mitigate the original sin of the American experience \u2014 the genocide of the Native people,\" Kennedy said during his visit.",
      "Some tribal leaders say the recent cuts, and the way the administration made them, violate treaties in which the U.S. promised to provide for the health and welfare of tribes in return for taking their land.",
      "\"We have not been consulted with meaningfully on any of these actions,\" said Malerba, director of policy and legislative affairs for the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund, which advocates for tribes from Texas to Maine.",
      "Alkire said at the congressional hearing that many Native American health organizations sent letters to the health department asking for consultations but none has received a response.",
      "Tribal consultation is legally required when federal agencies pursue changes that would have a significant impact on tribal nations.",
      "\"This is not just a moral question of what we owe Native people,\" Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said at the hearing. \"It is also a question of the law.\"",
      "Tribal leaders are worried about additional proposed changes, including funding cuts to the Indian Health Service and a reorganization of the federal health department.",
      "Esther Lucero, president and CEO of the Seattle Indian Health Board, said the maneuvers remind her of the level of daily uncertainty she felt working through the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 only with fewer resources.",
      "\"Our ability to serve those who are desperately in need feels at risk,\" Lucero said.",
      "Among the most pressing concerns are congressional Republicans' proposed cuts to Medicaid, the primary government health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities.",
      "About 30% of Native American and Alaska Native people younger than 65 are enrolled in Medicaid, and the program helps keep Indian Health Service and other tribal health facilities afloat.",
      "Native American adults would be exempt from Medicaid work requirements approved by House Republicans on May 21.",
      "After Kennedy summited Window Rock with Navajo Nation leaders, the tribe held a prayer ceremony in which they blessed him in Din\u00e9 Bizaad, the Navajo language. President Nygren stressed how meaningful it was for the country's health secretary to walk alongside them. He also reminded Kennedy of the list of priorities they'd discussed. That included maintaining the federal low-income energy assistance program.",
      "\"We look forward to reestablishing and protecting some of the services that your department provides,\" Nygren said.",
      "As of mid-May, the Trump administration had proposed eliminating the energy program, which remains unstaffed.",

She has invoked help from her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon Mr. Trump issued her on Jan. 20, his\u00a0first day back in the White House.",
      "Though Hemphill was a defendant of the largest criminal prosecution in American history, she is seemingly standing alone now as the only Jan. 6 defendant to refuse the clemency Mr. Trump offered.",
      "Speaking with CBS News from her home in Idaho, Hemphill said, \"The pardons just contribute to their narrative, which is all lies, propaganda. We were guilty, period.\"",
      "\"We all know that they're gaslighting us. They are using January 6 to just continue Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized,\" she said. \"They were not. When the FBI came to my home, oh my God, they were very professional. They treated me very good.\"",

      "Of a call between the two leaders, \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said in April that he spoke to his Chinese counterpart about tariffs, but Beijing denied that a direct conversation took place. Mr. Trump has vowed since he took office in January to speak with Xi, but no formal plans have been announced.",
      "Weeks after the U.S. and China agreed to a temporary easing of tariffs imposed on imports earlier in the year, Mr. Trump said Friday that China was violating the trade agreement, though he didn't outline the alleged violations.",
      "\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual,\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social Friday, before adding that \"China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"",
      "Last month, the U.S. and China committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies that had been imposed since early April, reducing the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to about 30%, while China reduced its levies on American imports to 10%.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller outlined to reporters Friday that China had \"abrogated the agreement.\"",
      "\"China did not fulfill the obligations that it made and committed to with the United States. And so that opens up all manner of action for the United States to ensure future compliance,\" Miller said. \"It remains the President's hope and desire that China will choose the path of cooperation, of common ground, and that we can open up China to American business just in the same way that America, of course, that we all know has been open to Chinese business for a very long time now.\"",
      "Miller said the U.S. wants to see China comply with the agreement and fulfill its obligations \"as soon as possible\" to ensure a \"cooperative\" and \"constructive\" relationship that he said the president wants.",
      "On Sunday, Bessent acknowledged that the products China is withholding include critical minerals, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. The export of rare earths was thought to be at the center of the disagreement.",
      "\"The fact that they are withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement \u2014 maybe it's a glitch in the Chinese system, maybe it's intentional,\" Bessent said. \"We'll see after the president speaks with party chairman.\"",
      "The trade dispute comes amid other developments between the U.S. and China. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth outlined in recent days a developing military threat from China to Taiwan. And Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration would work to \"aggressively revoke\" the visas of some Chinese international students. Asked whether the administration was intentionally escalating a standoff with Beijing, Bessent said \"I don't think it's intentional.\"",
      "\"I think that what Secretary Hegseth did was remind everyone that during COVID, China was an unreliable partner, and what we are trying to do is to de-risk,\" Bessent said, while adding that the U.S. doesn't want to \"decouple.\"",
      "Bessent said \"what China is doing is they are holding back products that are essential for the industrial supply chains of India, of Europe.\"",
      "\"That is not what a reliable partner does,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday defended the Trump administration's escalating tariff policies, saying that while some companies have already announced price hikes, he thinks others will\u00a0 choose not to.",
      "\"Some are and some aren't,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" He pointed to companies like Home Depot and Amazon who have indicated they will not pass on tariff costs to consumers, whereas others, such as Walmart and Best Buy, have signaled potential price increases.",
      "President Trump on Friday announced that the tariff on foreign steel will double from 25% to 50%, effective June 4, and accused Beijing of violating a recent trade agreement by withholding critical exports like rare earth minerals.",
      "\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Friday morning on his Truth Social app.",
      "He added, \"The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement is the latest in the tariff standoff, coming nearly two months after Mr. Trump announced \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on the U.S.' trading partners, eventually hiking the levy on Chinese to 145%. China responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. In May, the U.S. eased the tariff on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China agreed then to reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "Bessent on Sunday emphasized the White House's intention is not to \"decouple\" from China but to \"de-risk,\"and defended the new trade stance as essential to national and economic security.",
      "\"What China is doing is holding back products essential for industrial supply chains in India and Europe,\" Bessent said. \"That is not what a reliable partner does.\"",
      "Retailers, however, have sounded the alarm about the ripple effects of the ongoing U.S.-China trade standoff. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target have warned that high tariffs on imports from Asia could drive up prices for American consumers.",
      "Bessent addressed such warnings as speculative, highlighting companies who have opted not to raise prices.",
      "\"I know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying,\" he said. \"They're not raising prices. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration has identified sectors where Americans will feel the impact most, Bessent pointed to easing food and energy prices, and insisted that overall inflation is falling. \"Egg prices have collapsed,\" he said, crediting the administration's economic council and trade policies. Although egg prices have come down from the highest levels earlier this year, the Consumer Price Index showed in May that egg prices are still 49% higher than they were in May 2024.",
      "Despite industry concerns, Bessent argued Sunday that companies often offer worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to shield themselves from legal risk.",
      "\"They have to give the worst case,\" he said. \"Because if they haven't, and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.\"",

The economic whiplash from the on-again/off-again Trump tariffs persists here at home, as does the confusion around the world. As for President Trump, he's doubling down on his insistence that they will help the U.S. economy.",

      "SCOTT BESSENT (U.S. Treasury Secretary): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much to get to. I want to start with China, because the defense secretary just said there's an imminent military threat from China to Taiwan.",
      "Days earlier, Secretary Rubio said he'd aggressively revoked Chinese student visas. On top of that, you have curbing exports to China. Trade talks, you said, with Beijing are stalled, and President Trump just accused China of violating an agreement, and now says no more Mr. Nice Guy.",
      "Are you intentionally escalating this standoff with Beijing?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I don't think it's intentional.",
      "I \u2013 I think that what Secretary Hegseth did was remind everyone that, during COVID, China was an unreliable partner. And what we are trying to do is to de-risk. We do not want to decouple, Margaret, but we do need to de- risk, as we saw during COVID, whether it was with semiconductors, medicines, the other products. We are in the process of de-risking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Making the United States less reliant on China, but at the same\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, and the whole world, the whole world, because what China is doing is, they are holding back products that are essential for the industrial supply chains of India, of Europe, and that is not what a reliable partner does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is that \u2013 like, what specifically is President Trump saying when he says they are violating an agreement? Because it was the one you negotiated in Geneva earlier this month.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And what's the consequence for that?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, we will see what the consequences are.",
      "I am confident that, when President Trump and Party Chairman Xi have a call, that this will be ironed out. So \u2013 but the fact that they are withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement, maybe it's a glitch in the Chinese system. Maybe it's intentional. We'll see after the president speaks with the party chairman.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's critical minerals, rare earths? Is that what you're talking about?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president has said a few times that he was going to speak to President Xi, but he hasn't since before the inauguration.",
      "Beijing keeps denying that there was any contact. Do you have anything scheduled?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I believe we'll see something very soon, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a conversation with your counterpart or Lutnick with his counterpart at the commerce level?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I think we're going to let the two principles have a conversation, and then everything will stem from that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: J.P. Morgan Jamie Dimon spoke this week at an economic forum, and he gave this read on Beijing:",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "JAMIE DIMON (Chairman, J.P. Morgan Chase): I just got back from China last week. They're not scared, folks. This notion they're going to come bow to America, no, I wouldn't count on that. You know, and when they have a problem, they put 100,000 engineers on it, and, no, they've been preparing for this for years.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you underestimated the Chinese state's backbone here?",

      "And Jamie is a great banker. I know him well, but I would vociferously disagree with that assessment, that the laws of economics and gravity apply to the Chinese economy and the Chinese system, just like everyone else.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were last here in March, we were trying to gauge what the impact of the standoff with China and with the tariffs on the rest of the world would do for American consumers here at home.",
      "At that time, you told us you were going to appoint an affordability czar and council to figure out five \u2013 you said, or eight areas where there will be some pain for working-class Americans. Where are you anticipating price increases?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, thus far \u2013 we wanted to make sure that there aren't price increases, Margaret. And, thus far, there have been no price increases. Everything has been alarmist, that the inflation numbers are actually dropping.",
      "We saw the first drop of inflation in four years. The inflation numbers last week, they were very \u2013 the \u2013 pro-consumer. We've seen\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But you listen to earnings calls just like we do. You know what Walmart's saying, what Best Buy's saying and what Target are saying of what's coming.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: But, Margaret, I also know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying. I know what the \"South China Morning Post\" wrote within the past 24 hours, that 65 percent, 65 percent \u2013 the \u2013 of the tariffs will likely be eaten by the Chinese producers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are there five or eight areas that you have identified, as you said back in March, where American consumers will be able to have lower prices, or should be warned of higher prices?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a lot of it's already working its way through the system. So we've seen a substantial decrease in gasoline and energy prices. So that's down 20 percent year over year.",
      "We've seen the food prices go down, these notorious egg prices. Through the good work of President Trump and Secretary Rollins, egg prices have collapsed. So we're seeing more and more. And what we want to do, the \u2013 is even that out across the \u2013 all sections of the economy.",
      "So, inflation has been very tame. Consumer earnings were up 0.8 percent last month, which is a gigantic increase for one month. So, real earnings minus low inflation is great for the American people, and that's what we're seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, because when you met with the Chinese earlier this month, and you went down from the 145 percent tariff down to about \u2013 it's like 30 percent; 30 percent's not nothing, that tax on goods coming in here.",
      "Retailers are warning of price hikes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, but \u2013 but \u2013 but \u2013 but\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you go back-to-school shopping, things are going to cost more.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: But, Margaret, some are and some aren't. Home Depot and Amazon said they're not. And I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Home Depot and Amazon aren't where you go for your back- to-school shopping, when you buy your jeans, when you buy your crayons, and you buy all those things that parents\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I don't know about you, but I do it online at Amazon.",
      "This isn't an advertisement for Amazon. And guess where most of the Halloween costumes in America get bought? At Home Depot. So that's just not right. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.",
      "And I was in the investment business for 35 years, Margaret, and I will tell you earnings calls, they have to give the worst-case scenario, because if it \u2013 if they haven't and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not always the worst case. It's the most probable case as well.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, they have to give the worst case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Walmart \u2013 there was just a piece published with the conservative strategist Karl Rove. I'm not asking about politics, because he is a political strategist, but he went in on the math here.",
      "And he points out that Walmart has a profit margin of less than 3 percent. He says: \"If it does what Mr. Trump says, eat the tariffs, it can't break even. It can't absorb the cost of an imported pair of kids jeans with a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam, a 37 percent tariff for Bangladesh, or 32 percent tariff on sneakers from Indonesia. Other companies are in the same pickle.\"",
      "So should companies cut back on the amount of goods they have on their shelves or just on their profitability?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: That \u2013 that's a decision company by \u2013 by company, Margaret.",
      "And I had a long discussion with Doug McMillon, the CEO of Walmart, and they're going to do what's right for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, for consumers, the reality is, there will either be less inventory or things at higher prices, or both.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, when we were here in March, you said there was going to be big inflation. There hasn't been any inflation. Actually, the inflation numbers are the best in four years. So why don't we stop trying to say this could happen and wait and see what does happen?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just trying to gauge for people planning ahead here.",
      "One of the things the president said on Friday is that he's going to double the tariffs on steel and aluminum up to 50 percent effective June the 4th. How much will that impact the construction industry?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I think \u2013 I was with the president at the U.S. Steel plant in Pittsburgh on Friday, and I will tell you that the president has the \u2013 reignited the steel industry here in America.",
      "And back to the earlier statements on national security, there are national security priorities here for having a strong steel industry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have a prediction on how much it's going to impact the construction industry, for example?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I \u2013 I have a prediction on how much it's going to impact the steel industry.",
      "And, you know, we \u2013 again, we'll see. There are a lot of elasticities that \u2013 you know, this is a very complicated ecosystem. So is it going to impact the construction industry? Maybe. But it's going to impact the steel industry the \u2013 in a great way. The steelworkers, again, were left on the side of the road after the China shock, and now they're back, that the \u2013 they are Trump supporters.",
      "And when I tell you that it was magic in the arena, or it was actually at the steel plant that night, that these hardworking Americans know their jobs are secure\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 there's going to be capital investment, and the number of jobs is going to be grown around the country, whether it's in Pittsburgh, whether it's in Arkansas, whether it's in Alabama.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this big tax bill that worked through the House, is going to the Senate next.",
      "In it is an increase or suspension to the debt limit that you need delivered on by mid-July. How close of a brush with default could this be, given how massive some of the Senate changes are expected to be to the other parts of the bill?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, first of all, Margaret, I will say the United States of America is never going to default. That is never going to happen, that we are on the warning track and we will never hit the wall.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have more wiggle room if they don't deliver this by mid-July? I mean, how hard of a date is this?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The \u2013 we don't give out the X-date, because we use that to move the bill forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sometimes, deadlines help force action, as you know, particularly in this town, sir. That's why I'm asking.",
      "The president did say he \u2013 he expects pretty significant changes to this bill, though, so that affects the timing of it moving. What would you like Republican lawmakers to keep? What would you like them to alter?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Again, that's going to be the Senate's decision. Leader Thune, who I have worked closely with during this process, has been doing a fantastic job.",
      "And, Margaret, I will point out, everyone said that Speaker Johnson would not be able to get this bill out of the House with his slim majority. He got it out. Leader Thune has a bigger majority, and this is with President Trump's leadership. So, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's no red lines for you in there of just don't touch this, you can, you know, tinker with that?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I \u2013 I think that they're not necessarily my red lines.",
      "The president has the \u2013 his campaign promises that he wants to fulfill for working Americans, so no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans for American-made automobiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those have to stay in, is what you're saying.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Those have to stay in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: J.P. Morgan's Dimon also predicted a debt market crisis. Cracks in the bond market' was what he said.",
      "You are considering easing some regulations, you've said, for the big banks. How do you avoid that bond market crisis he's predicting spreading and really causing concern, particularly with all of the worries about American debt right now?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: So, again, I have known Jamie a long time. And for his entire career, he's made predictions like this. Fortunately, none of them have come true. That's why he's a banker, a great banker. He tries to look around the corner.",
      "One of the reasons I'm sitting here talking to you today and not at home watching your show is that I was concerned about the level of debt. So the deficit this year is going to be lower than the deficit last year, and in two years it will be lower again. We are going to bring the deficit down slowly.",
      "We didn't get here in one year. We didn't get here in one year, and this has been a long process. So the goal is to bring it down over the next four years, leave the country in great shape in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know that the speaker of the House estimates this is going to add $4 trillion to $5 trillion over the next 10 years, and there's that debt limit increase.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well again, Margaret, that's CBO scoring.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the speaker of the House.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No, no, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said it last Sunday on this program.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The \u2013 he said that's the CBO scoring. Let me\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, he said that sounds right.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Let me tell you what's not included in there, what can't be scored.",
      "So we're taking in substantial tariff income right now, so there are estimates that that could be another $2 trillion that we are the \u2013 pushing through savings. So you know my estimate is, that could be up to another $100 billion a year. So, over the 10-year window, that could be a trillion.",
      "The president has a prescription drug plan with the pharmaceutical companies that could substantially push down costs for prescription drugs, and that could be another trillion. So there's the four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Treasury Secretary Bessent, we'll be watching closely what happens next.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Lexington, Kentucky, this morning.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the treasury secretary say a number of things, dismissed the potential price increases that could come from the tariffs when it comes to retailers. He also played down the cost of this tax and border bill that just passed through the House.",
      "Do you agree with his math?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, the math doesn't really add up.",
      "One of the things this big and beautiful bill is, is, it's a vehicle for increasing spending for the military and for the border. It's about $320 billion in new spending. To put that in perspective, that's more than all the DOGE cuts that we have found so far. So, the increase in spending put into this bill exceeds the DOGE cuts.",
      "When you look just at the border wall, they have $46.5 billion for the border wall. Well, the current estimate from the CBP is $6.5 million per mile. So if you did 1,000 miles, that's $6.5 billion, but they have $46 billion. So they have inflated the cost of the wall eightfold.",
      "So there's a lot of new spending that has to be counteracted. But, essentially, this is a bill by the military industrial complex advocates who are padding the military budget. There's going to be a lot of extra money.",
      "Look, the president has essentially stopped the border flow without new money and without any new legislation. So I think they're asking for too much money. And, in the end, the way you add it up to see if it actually is going to save money or add money is, how much debt are they going to borrow?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Five trillion over two years, enormous amount.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That was the number that the secretary was quibbling over.",
      "The president has taken note of some of your skepticism, and he did tweet yesterday, saying that if you, Rand Paul, vote against his massive border and tax bill, the people of Kentucky will never forgive you.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you consider that a threat? And do you know if you have three other Republicans who will join you to block it from passage?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I had a very good conversation with the president this week about tariffs. He did most of the talking, and we don't agree exactly on the outcome.",
      "But when I come home to Kentucky, I talk to the Farm Bureau, which is opposed to the tariffs. I talk to the bourbon industry, which is opposed to the tariffs. I talk to the cargo companies, UPS, DHL. All of their pilots are opposed to it. I talk to the hardwood floor people. I talk to the people selling houses, building houses.",
      "I have no organized business \u2013 business interest in Kentucky for the tariffs. So I think it's worth the discussion, and it's worth people remembering that the Republicans used to be for lower taxes. Tariffs are a tax.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, if you raise taxes on the private sector, that's not good for the private sector.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we hear from other senators who also get complaints from their \u2013 people in their districts, but they're falling in line. Do you have three other Republicans who will stand with you to block this bill?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think there are four of us at this point, and I would be very surprised if the bill at least is not modified in a good direction.",
      "Look, I want to vote for it. I'm for the tax cuts. I voted for the tax cuts before. I want the tax cuts to be permanent. But, at the same time, I don't want to raise the debt ceiling $5 trillion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So I have told them, if you take the debt ceiling off the bill, in all likelihood, I can vote for what the agreement is on the rest of the bill, and it doesn't have to be perfect to my liking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I can't be \u2013 if I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt? We will have lost.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the leader, as you know, is sort of in a tight spot here. He needs a vehicle to raise that debt ceiling. Otherwise, you had to turn to Democrats to get that done.",
      "What was the White House response when you asked that to the president?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, historically, the debt ceiling has always gone up and will always go up, and I'm not proposing that it doesn't. But the people who should vote for it are the people who vote for the spending.",
      "Historically, all the Democrats vote for raising the debt ceiling, and about 15 big government Republicans vote for it. This will be the first time it's voted on just by Republicans. This will be the first time that Republicans own the debt. They already own the spending.",
      "In March, we continued, not me, but most Republicans voted to continue the Biden spending levels. So, you will remember the campaign. Everybody was talking about Bidenomics and Biden inflation and Biden spending levels. Well, the Republicans all voted to keep the Biden spending levels, and that's why the deficit this year is going to be $2.2 trillion this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you think is this bad politics for Republicans?",
      "Some of your Republican colleagues like Josh Hawley are saying that the changes to Medicaid are bad politics for America's working people and for your party.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think it was a bad strategy. I think the tax cuts are good for the economy. When we passed the tax cuts in 2017, the economy grew like gangbusters. We had lowest unemployment historically. It was the great achievement of Trump's first administration.",
      "They should have been satisfied by just doing the tax part of this\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and not getting involved into the debt part of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last time you were with us in March, you talked about conversations you had with Elon Musk. As you know, he's just left his work with the administration.",
      "You had proposed a rescission request, a clawback of about $500 billion from money Congress had already signed off on. We know now that the White House is going to ask Congress this week for some rescissions. Sounds like it's just $9.4 billion. And it's PBS, it's NPR and it's foreign aid.",
      "Is this really the best strategy? And do you think 51 Republican senators are on board with it?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: First of all, I will vote for spending cuts, the more, the better. This is very, very small. To put it in perspective, if the deficit this year is $2.2 trillion, if you cut $9 billion, the deficit is going to be $2.191 trillion.",
      "It really doesn't materially change the course of the country. We should do it, by all means, and it is the low-hanging fruit. This is the money that was pointed out that was being spent for sex change operations in Guatemala, trans opera in Columbia, all this crazy spending. Yes, it should be cut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sesame Street.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I had an amendment about a month \u2013 excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sesame Street. It's PBS and NPR.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes. Yes. And I think \u2013 yes, you're right. We will see if there's the votes to cut it.",
      "I don't think we necessarily need government programming anymore. We have so many choices on the Internet and so many choices on television. But my preference has always been in the past to cut a little bit of everything, rather than cut a lot of something.",
      "So what I have done in the past is propose a penny plan budget where we cut a certain percentage of everything, but it includes entitlements or it doesn't really work. Once you exclude the entitlements, there isn't enough money to cut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So you can never achieve balance by not looking at the entitlements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The budget director on another program this morning said they may not need to use this rescission, this clawback, because the White House has other tools. Do you think they need to go through Congress? Is this overstepping?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, they absolutely have to use a recession \u2013 the rescission.",
      "And it is done by simple majority, by Republicans only. There is no filibuster of it. So it's a great tool to cut spending. If they don't use it, it will be a huge wasted opportunity. But I will tell you, they tried in the first Trump administration. And it wasn't their fault. They sent a tiny one, $16 billion, and it failed because two Republicans went the other way.",
      "So we will see what happens on this, but if we can't even cut welfare that we're giving to other countries, if we can't cut foreign aid welfare, I feel bad for the country. Interest rates are rising. We're having trouble selling our debt. We have got a lot of problems.",

      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes, so this appears to be a subvariant of JN1, which has been the dominant strain. So, it's believed that there is cross immunity protection. The Covid virus is going to continue to mutate and it's behaving like a common cold virus. It's now going to become the fifth coronavirus that's seasonal that causes about 25 percent of the cases of the common cold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're thinking of it as like a \u2013 a \u2013 a flu-type variant? Just normal fluctuations.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: The flu mutates about 34 times more frequently than Covid. The Covid variant mutation rate appears to be a little more stable. But the international bodies that have provided some guidance on which strain to target have suggested that either JN1 or any of these subvariants would be reasonable strains to target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you don't seem overly concerned about that.",
      "I want to get now into some of the recommendations that have been very specific this week from the CDC. and you, with the HHS secretary, in this video announcement on Tuesday, where Secretary Kennedy said the CDC was removing the Covid vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women from its recommended immunization schedule. He then had a memo to the CDC rescinding recommendations for kids' vaccines, saying the known risks do not outweigh the benefits. Then, late Thursday, the CDC said, quote, \"shared clinical decision-making,\" which I think is just talking to your doctor \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should determine whether kids get vaccinated.",
      "Can you clearly state what the policy is, because this is confusing?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes, we believe the recommendation should be with the patient and their doctor. So, we're going to get away from these blanket recommendations in healthy, young Americans because we don't want to see \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For all vaccines?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: We don't \u2013 well, on the Covid vaccine schedule, we don't want to see kids kicked out of school because a 12-year-old girl is not getting her fifth Covid booster shot. We don't see the data there to support a young, healthy child getting a repeat infinite annual Covid vaccine.",
      "There's a theory that we should sort of blindly approve the new Covid boosters in young, healthy kids every year in perpetuity and a \u2013 a young girl born today should get 80 Covid mRNA shots or other Covid shots in her average lifespan. We're saying that's a theory and we'd like to check in and get some randomized controlled data. It's been about four years since the original randomized trials. So, we'd like an evidence-based approach. Dr. Persad (ph) and I published this in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" last week. And we're basically saying, we'd like to bring some confidence back to the public around this repeat booster strategy theory because \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your statement was not about repeat boosters. It says, the vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. The vaccine is not recommended for healthy children. That's different than annual boosters.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: At \u2013 at \u2013 yes, at this point we're dealing \u2013 you know, it is a booster strategy \u2013 people would be getting the updated shot. So, whether or not a young, healthy \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about kids who haven't gotten the shot?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, we'd like to see the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: We'd love to see that \u2013 that \u2013 that data. It doesn't exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, but on a practical level. For a parent at home hearing you and trying to make sense of you.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes. We're saying, take it back to your doctor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If their child has not been vaccinated, are you recommending that their first encounter with Covid be an actual infection?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: We're not going to push the Covid shot in young, healthy kids without any clinical trial data supporting it. That is a decision between a parent and their doctor. And just so you \u2013 I don't know if you know these statistics, but 80 \u2013 for 88 percent of American kids, their parents have said no to the Covid shot last season.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, America \u2013 the vast majority of Americans are saying, no. Maybe they want to see some clinical data as well. Maybe they have concerns about the safety.",

      "MARTY MAKARY: The worst thing \u2013 the worst thing \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't go with popularity, go with, as you're saying, data. And when we look at that data \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: Yes, so let's see the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, the CDC data said 41 percent of children age six months to 17 years hospitalized with Covid between 2022 and 2024 did not have a known underlying condition. In other words, they looked healthy.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Covid was serious for them.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, we \u2013 first of all, we know the CDC data is contaminated with a lot of false positives from incidental positive Covid tests with routine testing of every kid that walks in the hospital.",
      "When I go to the ICU \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE) CDC.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: When I walk to the \u2013 we know \u2013 we know that data historically, under the Biden administration, did not distinguish being sick from Covid or an incidental positive Covid test.",
      "When you go to an ICU in America and you ask, how many people are in the ICU that are healthy, that are sick with Covid, I \u2013 the answer I get again and again is, we haven't seen that in a year or years. And so, with the worst thing you can do in public health is to put out an absolute universal recommendation in young healthy kids. And the vast majority of Americans are saying, no, we want to see some data. And you say, forget about the data, just get it anyway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, on data and transparency, for decades, since 1964, it was the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP, that went through this panel recommendation. I mean people watched these things during Covid. The report was then handed up. It offered debate, it offered transparency and it offered data points that people could refer back to. Why did you bypass all of this and just come down with a decision before the panel could meet and make that data?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: That \u2013 that panel has been a kangaroo court where they just rubber stamp every single vaccine put in front of them. If you look at the minutes of the report from \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Weren't they in the (INAUDIBLE)?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: They \u2013 they even say, we were \u2013 generally want to move towards a risk stratified approach. But go \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why not let them do that in June?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, in the meantime, we don't want an absolute recommendation for healthy kids to get it. They can do it. And that committee \u2013 committee will meet and make recommendations.",
      "But you look at the minutes of the last couple years, they say, we want a simple message for everybody just so they can understand it. It was not a data-based conversation. It was a conversation based on marketing and ease. And \u2013 and I've written an article titled \"why people don't trust the CDC,\" and it's in part from that blanket strategy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're kind of telling them not to right now. You just said, don't trust the CDC.",
      "MARTY MAKARY: We're saying it's going to be between a doctor and a patient until that committee meets or more experts weigh in or we get some clinical data. If there's zero clinical data, you're opining. I mean you're just \u2013 it's a theory. And so, we don't want to put out an absolute recommendation for kids with no clinical data to support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So, you made this pronouncement as well on pregnant women. There is data, researchers in the U.K. analyzed a series of 67 studies which included 1.8 million women. And the journal BMJ Global Health published it. People can Google it at home. And it says the Covid vaccine \"in pregnant women is highly effective in reducing the odds of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, and hospital admission, and improves pregnancy outcomes, with no safety concerns.\"",
      "This is data that shows that it is recommended or could be advised for pregnant women to take the vaccine. Why do you find otherwise?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: There's no randomized controlled trial. That's the gold standard. Those 67 studies are mixed. The data in pregnant women is different for healthy versus women with a \u2013 a co-morbid condition. So, it's a very mixed bag. So, we're saying, your obstetrician, your primary care doctor and the pregnant woman should together decide whether or not to get it.",
      "Twelve percent of pregnant women last year got the Covid shot. So, people have serious concerns and it's probably because they want to see a \u2013 a randomized trial data. The randomized trial in pregnant women \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in the meantime, the world moves on. And you published in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" on May 20th, in that report you referenced, you listed pregnancy as an underlying medical condition that increases a person's risk for severe Covid. You said that.",
      "So, then, seven days later, you joined in this video announcement saying you should drop the recommendation for the Covid vaccine in healthy, pregnant women. So, what changed in the seven days?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: In \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" we simply list what the \u2013 what the CDC has traditionally defined as high risk. And we're \u2013 we're just saying, decide with your doctor. We're not saying one way or the other. And the randomized trial \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But doctors want data and information as well from you and you're \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: So, here's the data on \u2013 on pregnant women. A randomized controlled trial was set up and it was closed without any explanation. We wanted to see that trial complete so women can have information that in a randomized control trial, which is the gold standard, this is what the data shows. We don't have those data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. It is still unclear what pregnant women now should do until they get the data that you say \u2013",
      "MARTY MAKARY: I'd say, talk to their doctor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When do they get the data you're promising, all these controlled studies?",
      "MARTY MAKARY: In the absence of data they should talk to their doctor and their doctor will use their best wisdom and judgement.",

      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get straight to it.",
      "You heard from the secretary of state this week that the State Department is going to work with Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party for studying in critical fields. There are like 300,000 Chinese students with visas in this country. The U.S. government already has a heightened level of vetting. What's going to change?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. There's not enough details. But what it looks like that they're targeting all people of Chinese origin who are on international student visas because he's not limiting it to just people who might have ties to the Chinese Communist Party. And if they do have those ties, they don't belong here, especially if they're committing nefarious acts.",
      "However, this appears to be much broader and it's terribly misguided and it appears prejudicial and discriminatory. My own father was \u2013 came here on an international student visa and I believe that these people are vital for our economy and for entrepreneurship in this country. And I think this is going to harm America more than help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you said if someone has ties to the Chinese Communist Party they shouldn't be here. Does that mean all the students \u2013 the students who were children of leaders, for example, Xi Jinping's own daughter, shouldn't have been allowed here?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, if they were engaged in nefarious activities and if they are somehow deeply connected to the CCP, I think that we should be very careful. But in this particular case, they're not only going after people who might fall in that category, but it's anybody who is from China, including Hong Kong, by the way, where people are actually persecuted for various freedoms they're trying to exercise and who come here seeking to exercise those freedoms.",
      "So, this is a terrible \u2013 terribly misguided policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration did conduct heightened vetting, as you know, of Chinese students. Do you think that there's a legitimate argument for expanding this, that certain areas should just be off-limits?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think that you should definitely have heightened vetting, especially in certain critical areas, because we know that the CCP tries to steal, for instance, intellectual property, or worse. But the way that this is currently structured looks very, very suspicious. And you have to remember that the people that are cheering for this policy, what Marco Rubio had called for, is the Chinese Communist Party. Why? Because they want these people back. They want the scientists and the entrepreneurs and the engineers who can come and help their economy.",
      "And so, we are probably helping them, as well as other countries, more than helping ourselves with this policy.",

But I think the problem is, at the same time he says that, either Donald Trump or even him or others say other things that push away our friends, partners, and allies in the region and cause confusion. And so, we need to be consistent and thoughtful with regard to our statements and we need to be also very methodical about our actions in trying to curb military aggression by the Chinese Communist Party in the South China Sea and with regard to Taiwan.",

      "What can you tell us about the level of U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine right now and helping them with their targets?",
      "CONGRESSMAN RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I \u2013 I don't want to get into classified information. But what I can say is that it's a little bit more strained in light of what Donald Trump has said recently.",
      "The one thing that I can also say is that Trump was right the other day to say that Putin is crazy in the way that he's going after civilian areas in Ukraine, repeatedly. And so, the Ukrainians are striking back.",
      "At the end of the day, the only way that we can bring these hostilities to an end is by strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians. Trump should, at this point, realize that Putin is playing him and aid the Ukrainians in their battlefield efforts. That's the best way to get to some type of armistice or truce at the negotiating table, sooner than rather later.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up on something we were just discussing with the congressman, and that is this instruction to have new scrutiny of Chinese students. But also more broadly, Secretary Rubio said all U.S. embassies should not schedule any new student visa application appointments at this time. About 14 percent of your students are international. Are you concerned they won't be able to come back to school in September?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: I'm very concerned. Not only about Wesleyan, but about higher education in the United States.",
      "One of the great things about our system of education is that it attracts people from all over the world who want to come to America to learn. And while they're here learning, they learn about our country, our values, our freedoms. And this is really an act of intimidation to scare schools into towing the line of the current administration. It really has nothing to do with national security or with anti-Semitism. This is \u2013 this heightened scrutiny is \u2013 is meant to instill fear on college campuses, and I'm afraid it is working.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it is noticeable, sir, that, you know, at a time when so many higher education institutions, Harvard, Columbia, Brown, have had federal funding revoked because of their policies, we find heads of universities are fearful of speaking out. Why are you not afraid of speaking critically?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: Well, I am. I'm afraid too. But I just find it extraordinary that Americans are afraid to speak out. Especially people who, you know, run colleges and universities. Why \u2013 which \u2013 this is a free country. I've been saying it my whole life. I used to tell my parents that when I didn't want to do something. I would say, it's a free country. And this idea that we're supposed to actually conform to the ideologies in the White House, it's not just bad for Harvard or for Wesleyan, it's \u2013 it's bad for the whole country because journalists are being intimidated, law firms are being intimidated, churches, synagogues and mosques will be next. We have to defend our freedoms.",
      "And when we bring international students here, what they experience is what it's like to live in a free country. And we can't let the president change the atmosphere so that people come here and are afraid to speak out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there are also some specific criticisms being lodged by members of the administration. Do you think that higher education has become too dependent on federal funding, for example, or money from foreign donors? Are there legitimate criticisms?",
      "MICHAEL ROTH: There are lots of legitimate criticisms of higher education. I don't think overdependence on federal funding is the issue. Most of the federal funding you hear the press talk about are contracts to do specific kinds of research that are really great investments for the country.",
      "However, the criticisms of colleges and universities that we have, a mono culture that we don't have enough diversity, that's a criticism I've been making of my own school and the rest of higher education for years.",
      "I think we can make improvements. But the way we make improvements is not by just lining up behind a president, whoever that happens to be. We make improvements by convincing our faculty and students to broaden our perspectives, to \u2013 to welcome more political and cultural views.

    "summary": "GOP Sen. Rand Paul said Sunday that \"the math doesn't really add up\" on the cost of President Trump's \"one big beautiful bill,\" outlining his opposition as the legislation moves to the Senate this week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said Sunday that \"the math doesn't really add up\" on the cost of President Trump's \"one big beautiful bill,\" while outlining his opposition as the legislation moves to the Senate this week.",
      "\"I think they're asking for too much money,\" Paul said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Paul is among a handful of Senate Republicans who have expressed opposition to the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second term agenda that addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities and which the House narrowly approved last month. The Kentucky Republican argued Sunday that with the legislation, \"there's going to be a lot of extra money\" going toward \"padding the military budget\" and additional border security when \"the President has essentially stopped the border flow without new money and without any legislation.\"",
      "But Paul's red line, he indicated, is on the legislation's provision that would to raise the debt ceiling. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act. Paul has advocated for removing the debt ceiling provision from the bill and voting on the issue separately.",
      "Paul said he wants to vote for the legislation and its tax components should the debt ceiling component be removed, saying \"in all likelihood, I can vote for what the agreement is on the rest of the bill, and it doesn't have to be perfect to my liking.\" But for him, the debt ceiling increase is a nonstarter.",
      "\"If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?\" Paul said. \"The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"",
      "Congressional Republicans have sought to raise the debt ceiling as part of the broader budget package because the reconciliation process that governs the bill allows them to move forward without support from across the aisle. Separating the debt ceiling component from the broader bill would mean Senate Republicans would have to negotiate with Democrats, giving them an opportunity to extract leverage despite the GOP majorities in Congress.",
      "Still, Paul argued that the Republicans who support the spending increase should be the ones responsible for voting for a debt ceiling increase, noting that Democrats have historically supported raising the debt limit as well. The Kentucky Republican has also proposed smaller increases that suspend the debt limit for a matter of months, forcing lawmakers to verify that spending cuts have been implemented before approving a further hike.",
      "Mr. Trump warned Paul about opposing the legislation in a post on Truth Social Saturday, saying \"Rand will be playing right into the hands of the Democrats, and the GREAT people of Kentucky will never forgive him!\"",
      "Meanwhile, Bessent, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" pushed back on the bill's forecasted impact on the deficit, pointing to income from tariffs among other things that he said will improve the full picture.",
      "The treasury secretary said changes to the bill will be \"the Senate's decision,\" noting that he's been working closely with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, whom he said has been \"doing a fantastic job.\"",
      "\"Everyone said that Speaker Johnson would not be able to get this bill out of the House with his slim majority \u2013 he got it out, \" Bessent said. \"Leader Thune has a bigger majority, and this is with President Trump's leadership.\"",
      "Asked about the administration's red lines as the bill heads to the Senate, Bessent pointed to some of the president's campaign promises, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, among others, which he said would \"have to stay in.\"",
      "On the debt limit, Bessent urged that \"the United States of America is never going to default.\" But he declined to specify an X date, or the date the U.S. will run out of money to pay its bills.",
      "\"That is never going to happen,\" he added. \"We are on the warning track, and we will never hit the wall.\"",

      "In a social media post after Mr. Trump's nomination announcement in December, Isaacman, 42, said NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who would help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said at the time. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible.

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Michael Roth, Wesleyan University president, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 1, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're turning now to the President of Wesleyan University, Michael Roth, who joins us from Monterey, Massachusetts. Good morning to you.",
      "WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT MICHAEL ROTH: Good morning. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up on something we were just discussing with the congressman, and that is this instruction to have new scrutiny of Chinese students, but also, more broadly, Secretary Rubio said all U.S. embassies should not schedule any new student visa application appointments at this time. About 14% of your students are international. Are you concerned they won't be able to come back to school in September?",
      "ROTH: I'm very concerned, not only about Wesleyan, but about higher education in the United States. One of the great things about our system of education is that it attracts people from all over the world who want to come to America to learn. And while they're here learning, they learn about our country, our values, our freedoms. And this is really an act of intimidation to scare schools into toeing the line of the current administration. It really has nothing to do with national security or with anti- antisemitism. This heightened scrutiny is meant to instill fear on college campuses, and I'm afraid it is working.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it is noticeable, sir, that you know, at a time when so many higher education institutions, Harvard, Columbia, Brown, have had federal funding revoked because of their policies, we find heads of universities are fearful of speaking out. Why are you not afraid of speaking critically?",
      "ROTH: Oh, I am. I'm afraid too. But I just find it extraordinary that Americans are afraid to speak out, especially people who, you know, run colleges, universities. Why- this is a free country. I've been saying it my whole life. I used to tell my parents that when I didn't want to do something, I would say it's a free country. And this idea that we're supposed to actually conform to the ideologies in the White House, it's not just bad for Harvard or for Wesleyan, it- it's bad for the whole country because journalists are being intimidated, law firms are being intimidated, churches, synagogues and mosques will be next. We have to defend our freedoms. And when we bring international students here, what they experience is what it's like to live in a free country, and we can't let the president change the atmosphere so that people come here and are afraid to speak out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there are also some specific criticisms being lodged by members of the administration. Do you think that higher education has become too dependent on federal funding, for example, or money from foreign donors, are there legitimate criticisms?",
      "ROTH: There are lots of legitimate criticisms of higher education. I don't think overdependence on federal funding is the issue. Most of the federal funding you hear the press talk about are contracts to do specific kinds of research that are really great investments for the country. However, the criticisms of colleges and universities that we have a monoculture, that we don't have enough intellectual diversity, that's a criticism I've been making of my own school and of the rest of higher education for years. I think we can make improvements, but the way we make improvements is not by just lining up behind a president, whoever that happens to be. We make improvements by convincing our faculty and students to broaden our perspectives, to welcome more political and cultural views, not to line up and conform to the ideology of those in power. But yes, we have work to do to clean up our own houses, and we ought to get to it. But to do it under the- under this- the gun of an aggressive authoritarian administration that- that will lead to a bad outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you define some of the protests that even Wesleyan had on its campus that were, you know, critical of the State of Israel, for example, regarding the war against Hamas in Gaza, do you consider them to be xenophobic by definition, antisemitic or anti-Jewish?",
      "ROTH: Oh no, certainly not by definition. There are lots of examples of antisemitism around the country, some of them are on college campuses. They're reprehensible. When Jewish students are intimidated or afraid to practice their religion on campus, or are yelled at or- it's horrible. But at Wesleyan and in many schools, the percentage of Jews protesting for Palestinians was roughly the same as the percentage of Jews on the campus generally.

      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: --Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get straight to it. You heard from the Secretary of State this week that the State Department is going to work with Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. There are like 300,000 Chinese students with visas in this country. The U.S. government already has a heightened level of vetting. What's going to change?",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. There's not enough details, but what it looks like if they're targeting all people of Chinese origin who are on international student visas because he's not limiting it to just people who might have ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and if they do have those ties, they don't belong here, especially if they're committing nefarious acts. However, this appears to be much broader and it's terribly misguided and it appears prejudicial and discriminatory. My own father was, came here on an international student visa. And I believe that these people are vital for our economy and for entrepreneurship in this country. And I think this is going to harm America more than help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said if someone has ties to the Chinese Communist Party they shouldn't be here. Does that mean all the, the students who are children of leaders, for example Xi Jinping's own daughter, shouldn't have been allowed here?",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, if they were engaged in nefarious activities and if they are somehow deeply connected to the CCP, I think that we should be very careful. But in this particular case, they're not only going after people who might fall in that category, but it's anybody who is from China, including Hong Kong by the way, where people are actually persecuted for various freedoms they're trying to exercise, and who come here seeking to exercise those freedoms. So this is a terrible, terribly misguided policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration did conduct heightened vetting, as you know, of Chinese students. Do you think that there is a legitimate argument for expanding this, that certain areas should just be off limits?",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think that you should definitely have heightened vetting, especially in certain critical areas because we know that the CCP tries to steal, for instance, intellectual property or worse. But the way that this is currently structured looks very, very suspicious and you have to remember that the people that are cheering for this policy, what Marco Rubio had called for, is the Chinese Communist Party. Why? Because they want these people back. They want the scientists and the entrepreneurs and the engineers who can come and help their economy. And so we are probably helping them, as well as other countries, more than helping ourselves with this policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Defense Secretary is traveling in Asia right now and he said in a defense forum speech that Beijing is quote \"concretely and credibly preparing to use military force.\" He said their military is rehearsing. Take a listen.",
      "PETE HEGSETH: Any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world. There's no reason to sugar coat it. The threat China poses is real and it could be imminent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He did not say what the consequences would be. Are you encouraged by what appears to be a statement of support for allies?",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I am. I think what he's saying is largely correct, but I think the problem is at the same time he says that, either Donald Trump or even him or others say other things that push away our friends, partners and allies in the region and cause confusion. And so we need to be consistent and thoughtful with regard to our statements, and we need to be also very methodical about our actions in trying to curb military aggression by the Chinese Communist Party in the South China Sea and with regard to Taiwan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Since you track U.S. intelligence, I wanted to ask you if you have any insight into what appears to be the swarm of Ukrainian drones that has destroyed 40 Russian military aircraft deep inside Russian territory overnight. Sources are telling our Jennifer Jacobs that the White House wasn't aware that this attack was planned. What can you tell us about the level of US intelligence sharing with Ukraine right now and helping them with their targets?",
      "REP. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to get into classified information, but what I can say is that it's a little bit more strained in light of what Donald Trump has said recently. The one thing that I can also say is that Trump was right the other day to say that Putin is crazy in the way that he's going after civilian areas in Ukraine repeatedly, and so the Ukrainians are striking back. At the end of the day, the only way that we can bring these hostilities to an end is by strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians. Trump should, at this point, realize that Putin is playing him and aid the Ukrainians in their battlefield efforts. That's the best way to get to some type of armistice or truce at the negotiating table sooner rather than later.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Lexington, Kentucky this morning. Good morning to you.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the Treasury Secretary say a number of things, dismiss the potential price increases that could come from the tariffs when it comes to retailers. He also played down the cost of this tax and border bill that just passed through the House. Do you agree with his math?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, the math doesn't really add up. One of the things this big and beautiful bill is is it's a vehicle for increasing spending for the military and for the border. It's about $320 billion in new spending. To put that in perspective, that's more than all the DOGE cuts that we found so far. So, the increase in spending put into this bill exceeds the DOGE cuts. When you look just at the border wall, they have 46.5 billion for the border wall. Well, the current estimate from the CBP is 6.5 million per mile. So, if you did 1,000 miles, that's 6.5 billion, but they have 46 billion. So they've inflated the cost of the wall eight fold. So, there's a lot of new spending that has to be counteracted. But essentially, this is a bill by the military industrial complex advocates who are padding the military budget. There's going to be a lot of extra money. Look, the President has essentially stopped the border flow without- without new money and without any new legislation. So, I think they're asking for too much money. And in the end, the way you add it up to see if it actually is going to save money or add money, is how much debt are they going to borrow? 5 trillion over two years, an enormous amount.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That- that was the number that the Secretary was quibbling over. The President has taken note of some of your skepticism, and he did tweet yesterday saying that if you, Rand Paul, vote against his massive border and tax bill the people of Kentucky will never forgive you. Do you consider that a threat, and do you know if you have three other Republicans who will join you to block it from passage?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I had a very good conversation with the President this week about tariffs. He did most of the talking, and we don't agree exactly on the outcome. But when I come home to Kentucky, I talk to the Farm Bureau, which is opposed to the tariffs. I talked to the bourbon industry which is opposed to the tariffs. I talked to the cargo companies, UPS, DHL, all their pilots are opposed to it. I talked to the hardwood floor people. I talked to the people selling houses, building houses. I have no organized business- business interests in Kentucky for the tariffs. So I think it's worth the discussion, and it's worth people remembering that the Republicans used to be for lower taxes. Tariffs are a tax. So, if you raise taxes on the private sector, that's not good for the private sector.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, we hear from other senators who also get complaints from their people in their districts, but they're falling in line. Do you have three other Republicans who will stand with you to block this bill?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think there are four of us at this point, and I would be very surprised if the bill, at least, is not modified in a good direction. Look, I want to vote for it. I'm for the tax cuts. I voted for the tax cuts before. I want the tax cuts to be permanent, but at the same time, I don't want to raise the debt ceiling 5 trillion. So, I've told him, if you take the debt ceiling off the bill, in all likelihood, I can vote for what the agreement is on the rest of the bill, and it doesn't have to be perfect to my liking. But I can't be- if I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt. We will have lost it. The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that the leader, as you know, is sort of in a tight spot here. He needs a vehicle to raise that debt ceiling. Otherwise, you have to turn to Democrats to get that done. What was the White House response when you asked that to the President?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, historically, the debt ceiling has always gone up and will always go up, and I'm not proposing that it doesn't, but the people who should vote for it are the people who vote for the spending. Historically, all the Democrats vote for raising the debt ceiling, and about 15 big government Republicans vote for it. This will be the first time it's voted on just by Republicans. This will be the first time that Republicans own the debt. They already own the spending. In March, we continued, not me, but most Republicans voted to continue the Biden spending levels. So you remember the campaign, everybody is talking about Bidenomics and Biden inflation and Biden spending levels. Well, the Republicans all voted to keep the Biden spending levels, and that's why the deficit this year is going to be $2.2 trillion this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you think this is bad politics for Republicans. Some of your Republican colleagues, like Josh Hawley, are saying that changes to Medicaid are bad politics for America's working people and for your party.",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think it was a bad strategy. I think the tax cuts are good for the economy. When we passed the tax cuts in 2017 the economy grew like gangbusters. We had lowest unemployment historically. It was the great achievement of Trump's first administration. They should have been satisfied by just doing the tax part of this and not getting involved into the debt part of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last time you were with us in March, you talked about conversations you had with Elon Musk, as you know, he's just left his work with the administration. You had proposed a rescission request, a claw back about $500 billion of money Congress had already signed off on. We know now that the White House is going to ask Congress this week for some rescissions. Sounds like it's just $9.4 billion and it's- it's PBS, it's NPR and it's foreign aid. Is this really the best strategy? And do you think 51 Republican senators are on board with it?",
      "SEN. PAUL: First of all, I will vote for spending cuts. The more the better. This is very, very small to put it in perspective, if the deficit this year is 2.2 trillion, if you cut 9 billion, the deficit is going to be 2.191 trillion. It really doesn't materially change the course of the country. We should do it by all means. And it is the low hanging fruit. This is the money that was pointed out that was being spent for sex change operations in Guatemala, trans-opera in Columbia, all this crazy spending. Yes, it should be cut--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Sesame Street.--",
      "SEN. PAUL: -- I had an amendment about a month- Excuse me--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sesame Street. It's PBS and NPR.",
      "SEN. PAUL: Yeah. And I think, yeah- you're right. We'll see if there's the votes to cut it. I don't think we necessarily need government programming anymore. We have so many choices on the internet and so many choices on television, but my preference has always been, in the past, to cut a little bit of everything, rather than cut a lot of something. So what I've done in the past is propose a penny plan budget where we cut a certain percentage of everything, but it includes entitlements, or it doesn't really work. Once you exclude the entitlements, there isn't enough money to cut so you can never achieve balance by not looking at the entitlements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The budget director on another program this morning said they may not need to use this rescission, this claw back, because the White House has other tools. Do you think they need to go through Congress? Is this overstepping?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, they- well, they absolutely have to use a recession- the rescission, and it is done by simple majority, by Republicans only. There is no filibuster of it. So, it's a great tool to cut spending. If they don't use, it will be a huge wasted opportunity. But I will tell you, they tried in the first Trump administration. It wasn't their fault. They sent a tiny one, 16 billion, and it failed because two Republicans went the other way. So, we'll see what happens on this. But if we can't even cut welfare that we're giving to other countries, if we can't cut foreign aid welfare, I feel bad for the country. You know, interest rates are rising. We're having trouble selling our debt. We've got a lot of problems.",

    "story": [
      "President Bill Clinton criticized President Trump's actions attacking the rule of law, and predicted that the president would pay a price among those who believe his actions are un-American.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like this before in my lifetime \u2013 somebody that says, 'Whatever I want should be the law of the land. It's my way or the highway.' And most Americans don't agree with that,\" Clinton said in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"But I like to think that he's paid a price for this, you know, name-calling and throwing his weight around \u2026 I think it's made him less popular.\"",
      "He said opposition to Mr. Trump would be bolstered if Democrats win governors' races at play this year, and win back the House in 2026.",
      "\"Look, only elections are going to change this,\" he said. \"But I do think the courts are getting their dander up. I think that him shutting law firms out of representing their clients before federal agencies and in federal buildings, because he doesn't agree with their position \u2013 that ain't America. We've never done that. The whole purpose of having a legal system is to have both sides be heard.\"",
      "Clinton said that, so far, the courts are stopping the president, \"including a lot of judges he appointed. And you know, he is looking for ways to basically defy all these court orders. But I think he'll have a hard time doing that. And if he does, I think it will hurt him in America.\"",
      "Democratic opposition",
      "Asked if he thought the only thing the Democratic Party could agree on was its antipathy towards Trump, Clinton replied, \"If I thought that were true, I would. But I don't think it's true. I just think that most people don't have any idea \u2013 most people who are criticizing the Democrats right now \u2013 have no idea how difficult it is to decide the right thing to do. I think it's not as easy as people think.",
      "\"That will come. Elections will happen. And we will see.",
      "\"President Trump has a right to do what he thinks is right; he's doing it,\" Clinton said. \"The courts are doing their jobs. There will be other elections. But someone needs to stand up and say, 'Damn it, what we have in common matters more. We cannot throw the legacy of this country away. We cannot destroy other people's trust in us. We need to preserve that and find a way to work together, and not humiliate other people just so we can win.' We gotta just calm down and try to pull people together again. That's what I think.\"",
      "Elder statesmen",
      "Last November, Clinton released his book, \"Citizen: My Life After the White House,\" and talked with \"Sunday Morning\" about the importance of citizens to \"stand up for what we think is right.\"",
      "The following month, Clinton, then 78, had a health scare that landed him in the hospital. \"It turned out to be no big deal,\" he said. \"I basically kind of lost my balance, and I knew I was sick, and I went to the hospital and checked in and they said I was severely dehydrated. And I got great care, and I left the next day.\"",
      "As for his health today, he said, \"Far as I know, it's great. But when you're older, you have to be more careful to stay hydrated.\"",
      "Asked about a recent book on President Joe Biden which suggested people around him had seen signs of cognitive and physical decline, Clinton said he never saw any cognitive decline, and did not feel that Biden was unfit to run for President. \"I thought he was a good president. The only concern I thought he had to deal with was, could anybody do that job until they were 86?\" Clinton said. \"And we'd had several long talks. I had never seen him and walked away thinking, He can't do this anymore. He was always on top of his briefs.",
      "\"I haven't read the book. And I saw President Biden not very long ago, and I thought he was in good shape. But the book didn't register with me 'cause I never saw him that way.\"",
      "Asked why he hasn't read the book, Clinton replied, \"I didn't want to. 'Cause he's not president anymore, and I think he did a good job. And I think we are facing challenges today without precedent in our history. And some people are trying to use this as a way to blame him for the fact that Trump was reelected.\"",

      "In the beginning, Donald Trump and Elon Musk got along great. \"He is a truly incredible guy,\" Trump said at a campaign rally last October, \"and I don't say that that often.\"",

      "The president invited Musk into the Oval Office and Cabinet meetings. Musk called himself \"first buddy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump welcomed Musk's idea to create a Department of Government Efficiency. [\"You gotta give him credit!\" the president told reporters.] \u00a0Musk demonstrated his goals for DOGE by wielding a chainsaw at a February meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy!\" he bellowed.",
      "In four months, DOGE took the chainsaw to every federal department: 250,000 workers were fired or bought out; Musk even slashed grants and staffing at environmental agencies, like the EPA and NOAA, after decades of warning about the risks of climate change.",
      "But Musk did not enjoy the pushback. There were acts of violence; death threats; lawsuits; mandatory re-hirings; and shouting matches with Cabinet members.",
      "Tesla profits plummeted by 71%\u2014and Musk's net worth dropped by $100 billion.",
      "Last month, Musk finally left Washington, but still intended to work on DOGE a day or two a week. And this past Tuesday, he offered \"Sunday Morning\" an interview at SpaceX's headquarters near Brownsville, at the southern tip of Texas.",
      "\"It's a bit unfair\"",
      "We knew we were in the right neighborhood when we saw a huge bust of Musk, installed by his admirers\u2014and vandalized by his critics.",
      "But the interview didn't get off to a smooth start.",
      "I asked, \"I noticed that all of your businesses involve a lot of components, a lot of parts. Do the tariffs and the trade wars affect any of this?\"",
      "\"You know, tariffs always affect things a little bit,\" Musk replied.",
      "\"I'm wondering what your thought is on the ban on foreign students, the proposal. I mean, you were one of those kids, right?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I mean, I think we wanna stick to, you know, the subject of the day, which is, like, spaceships, as opposed to, you know, presidential policy,\" Musk said.",
      "\"Oh, okay,\" I said. \"I was told anything is good, but\u2026\"",
      "\"No, well\u2014no,\" Musk replied.",
      "But Musk was\u00a0willing to talk about the DOGE firestorm. I asked him, \"You've spoken about how much of a grind and a stress it was on you, and you know, Tesla's reputation took a hit, your reputation took a hit. People are very upset about [effects on] Social Security, and national parks, and air traffic, and food safety, and cancer research, Alzheimer's research. Now that you've had a chance to look at it, might there have been a different approach?\"",
      "Musk said, \"Yeah, I think \u2026 what was starting to happen was that, like, it's a bit unfair because, like, DOGE became the whipping boy for everything. So, if there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame DOGE. I've had people think that, like, somehow DOGE is gonna stop them from getting their Social Security check, which is completely untrue.\"",

      "Musk calls for U.S. to \"delete entire agencies\" at home and \"mind its own business\" at times abroad",
      "I asked, \"I was just thinking about the, you know, 'move fast and break things,' you know, before you really understand what the agency does?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, I guess part of it is, like, is it depends on where you're coming from,\" Musk said. \"I'm like a proponent of smaller government, not bigger government. So, now if somebody's a proponent of, you know, more government programs and bigger government, and they see, 'Hey, DOGE is cutting all these government programs,' then they'll be fundamentally opposed to that because they just think the government should do more things. That's just a fundamental, I guess, ideological opinion.",
      "\"But my frank opinion of the government is that, like, the government is just, like, the DMV that got big, okay? So, when you say it like, 'Let's have the government do something,' you should think, 'Do you want the DMV to do it?'\"",
      "And then, Musk started talking about the Trump administration, without even being asked about Trump. \"And you know, it's not like I agree with everything the administration does,\" said Musk. \"So it's like, I mean, I agree with much of what the administration does. But we have differences of opinion. You know, there are things that I don't entirely agree with. But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention. So then, I'm a little stuck in a bind, where I'm like, well, I don't wanna, you know, speak up against the administration, but I also don't wanna take responsibility for everything this administration's doing.\"",
      "On the \"Big, Beautiful Bill\"",
      "In Washington, federal workers say that DOGE has left the government's operations in disarray. And worst of all, it might have all been for nothing. Musk claims to have saved the government $175 billion so far (nowhere close to his original target of $2 trillion, or even his revised\u00a0target of $1 trillion).",
      "And that\u00a0was before the president's new spending bill passed the House. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the president's proposed budget will add $3.8 trillion to our debt over the next ten years. It's now being debated in the Senate.",
      "Musk said, \"I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, doesn't decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.\"",
      "I said, \"I actually thought that, when this 'big, beautiful bill' came along, it'd be like, everything he's done on DOGE gets wiped out in the first year.\"",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk laughed. \"But I don't know if it could be both. My personal opinion.\"",
      "And here is where the story gets a little complicated.",
      "On Tuesday, right after our interview, CBS News released a clip of it to promote this very report. It was that part, where Musk criticizes Trump's spending bill, and his remarks became news. It went all the way to the White House, where the president was asked about Musk's criticism of the bill. Within 24 hours, Musk announced that his time in the Trump administration was officially over. Out of DOGE, out of government.",
      "Musk said that the reason was that his limited 130-day stint as advisor was ending. But until that moment, he'd been saying that he still intended to work on DOGE part-time. \"Well, DOGE is gonna continue, just as a way of life,\" he told us. \"I will have some participation in that, but as I've said publicly, my focus has to be on the companies at this point.\"",
      "Truth is, the Trump-Musk relationship had already seemed to be cooling. The president used to post about Musk about six times a week. But by April, he'd stopped mentioning Musk altogether.",
      "Still, on Friday, they held a media event at the White House to confirm their mutual admiration\u2014and to leave the door open for future collaboration. \"Elon's really not leaving,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's gonna be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling.\"",
      "Musk added, \"The DOGE team is doing an incredible job. They're going to continue doing an incredible job, and I will continue to be visiting here and be a friend and advisor to the president.\"",
      "Musk might be the first to admit that his DOGE experiment gave him a black eye\u2014like the actual black eye he had on Friday, which he says he got from his five-year-old son \u2026 or the matching one on that statue.",
      "At least for now, Musk says that his focus will be running his business ventures: Tesla, Starlink, X, xAI, Neuralink, Optimus robots, the Boring Company, and SpaceX.",
      "I asked, \"Are all of your businesses related in some way?\"",
      "\"I guess you can think of the businesses as things that improve the probable trajectory of civilization,\" Musk replied. \"So you know, for making life multi-planetary or extending life to Mars, the idea there is to ensure the long-term survival of life and consciousness as we know it.\"",
      "After our interview Tuesday, we were invited to witness the ninth launch of his Starship, the biggest rocket ever built. The two previous Starship tests ended in explosions \u2013 or, as SpaceX puts it, \"rapid unscheduled disassemblies.\" So, all eyes were on Test Launch 9 to see if a Starship could return to Earth in one piece.",
      "As Musk left our interview to watch the launch, he said something that could sum up all his enterprises: \"I can't guarantee success, but I can guarantee excitement.\"",
      "In the end, Elon Musk's giant rocket spun out of control. It did not survive re-entry.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",

    "story": [
      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump's tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.",
      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As state officials anticipate Medicaid funding cuts that could strip resources for those with disabilities and chronic health conditions, an army of unpaid caregivers waits in the wings: children.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.",
      "\"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,\" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. \"And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.\"",
      "In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.",
      "But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're \"actual people\" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.",
      "\"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "It's an evocative idea that has long bedeviled scientists: a huge and mysterious planet is lurking in the darkness at the edge of our solar system, evading all our efforts to spot it. Some astronomers say the strange, clustered orbits of icy rocks beyond Neptune indicate that something big is out there, which they have dubbed \"Planet Nine.\"",
      "Now, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive world has instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. And the existence of the new kid on the block could challenge the Planet Nine theory, the researchers have calculated.",
      "Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed and was\u00a0published online last week. That makes it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "An extraordinary dwarf planet discovered at the edge of our solar system @the_IAS https://t.co/B9Ia1gNxb9",
      "But that is still big enough to be considered a dwarf planet, lead study author Sihao Cheng of New Jersey's Institute for Advanced Study told AFP.",
      "\"Lucky\" discovery",
      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",
      "During its 25,000-year orbit, the object is only close enough to Earth to be observed around 0.5 percent of the time, which is roughly a century.",
      "\"It's already getting fainter and fainter,\" Cheng said.",
      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",
      "After taking a risk spending more than half a year sorting through a difficult dataset in search of Planet Nine, Cheng said he was \"lucky\" to have found anything at all.",
      "The researchers are requesting time to point the James Webb, Hubble and ALMA telescopes at their discovery.",
      "But Sam Deen, a 23-year-old amateur astronomer from California, has already been able to track the dwarf planet candidate through old datasets.",
      "\"OF201 is, in my opinion, probably one of the most interesting discoveries in the outer solar system in the last decade,\" Deen told AFP.",
      "\"See almost to the edge of the universe\"",
      "The icy rocks discovered in the Kuiper belt tend to have a clustered orbit going in a particular direction. Two decades ago, astronomers proposed this was due to the gravitational pull of a world up to 10 times larger than Earth, naming it Planet Nine and kicking off a debate that has rumbled since.",
      "It is also sometimes called Planet X, a name proposed for a hypothetical world beyond Neptune more than a century ago.",
      "Back in 1930, astronomers were searching for Planet X when they discovered Pluto, which became our solar system's ninth planet. But Pluto turned out to be too tiny \u2014 it is smaller than the moon \u2014\u00a0  and was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006.",
      "There are now four other officially recognized dwarf planets, and Cheng believes 2017 OF201 could join their ranks.",
      "When the researchers modeled its orbit, they found it did not follow the clustered trend of similar objects. This could pose a problem for the Planet Nine theory, but Cheng emphasized more data is needed.",
      "Samantha Lawler of Canada's University of Regina told AFP that this \"great discovery\" and others like it mean that \"the original argument for Planet Nine is getting weaker and weaker.\"",
      "The Vera Rubin Observatory, which is scheduled to go online in Chile this year, is expected to shed light on this mystery, one way or another.",
      "Deen said it was discouraging that no sign of Planet Nine has been found so far, but with Vera Rubin \"on the horizon I don't think we'll have to wonder about its existence for much longer.\"",
      "For Cheng, he still hopes that this huge planet is out there somewhere.",
      "\"We're in an era when big telescopes can see almost to the edge of the universe,\" he said.",
      "But what is in our \"backyard\" still largely remains unknown, he added.",
      "Cheng made the discovery alongside colleagues Jiaxuan Li and Eritas Yang from Princeton University, and Li said the newly found object demonstrates the power of open science.",
      "\"All the data we used to identify and characterize this object are archival data that are available to anyone, not only professional astronomers,\" Li said in a statement. \"This means that groundbreaking discoveries aren't limited to those with access to the world's largest telescopes. Any researcher, student, or even citizen scientist with the right tools and knowledge could have made this discovery, highlighting the value of sharing scientific resources.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",

    "summary": "It was Blue Origin's 12th flight carrying passengers to the edge of space and back since company founder Jeff Bezos flew the first such crewed mission in 2021.",
    "story": [
      "An international crew of four men and two women blasted off and rocketed to the edge of space Saturday, enjoying a few minutes of weightlessness and an out-of-this-world view before plunging back to Earth to wrap up Blue Origin's twelfth New Shepard passenger flight.",
      "\"It was such an incredible ride, very moving, very spiritual,\" Panamanian attorney Jaime Alem\u00e1n, a former ambassador to the United States, said after landing. \"Even better than I ever imagined. I've been traveling, thanks to the gods, all my life, this was like the cherry on top of a cake. I mean, to go up in space and see how huge it is,  you can only begin to imagine how much more there is still to discover.\"",
      "Blue Origin's hydrogen-fueled single-stage booster roared to life at 9:39 a.m. EDT and quickly climbed away from the company's West Texas launch site, accelerating to just over 2,000 mph before releasing the New Shepard spacecraft.",
      "The crew capsule, equipped with the largest windows of any operational spaceship, continued coasting up to an altitude of nearly 65 miles, just above the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space, before beginning the descent to landing.",
      "At the moment the capsule was released, its three American passengers \u2014 Aymette Medina Jorge, Gretchen Green and Paul Jeris\u00a0 \u2014 along with Alem\u00e1n, Canadian Jesse Williams and New Zealand's Mark Rocket, began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness as they coasted upwards.",
      "The reusable New Shepard booster, meanwhile, also continued upward before slowing and beginning its on tail-first descent. Seven minutes after liftoff, the rocket's BE-3 engine re-ignited, four landing legs deployed and the booster settled to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad near the launch site.",
      "The gumdrop-shaped New Shepard capsule took a more leisurely flight home, descending under three large parachutes to touchdown in the West Texas desert 10 minutes after liftoff.",
      "\"You guys, we did it!\" one of the passengers exclaimed.",
      "Blue Origin has now launched 12 passenger flights since the sub-orbital spacecraft carried Amazon- and Blue Origin-founder Jeff Bezos and three others aloft in July 2021. The company has now launched 68 passengers, including four who have flown twice.",
      "Blue Origin and its passengers do not reveal how much it costs to fly aboard a New Shepard, but it's estimated to cost upwards of $500,000 per seat. Jorge's seat was sponsored by Farmacias Similares, a Mexican company focused on accessible healthcare across Latin America. Her crewmates presumably paid for their own tickets.",
      "Blue Origin has had the sub-orbital passenger market to itself since June 2024 when competitor Virgin Galactic, founded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, retired its original rocketplane to focus on building two upgraded Delta-class spacecraft. Virgin is expected to resume flights next year.",

    "summary": "U.S. astronomers hunting for \"Planet Nine\" have instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches.",
    "story": [
      "It's an evocative idea that has long bedeviled scientists: a huge and mysterious planet is lurking in the darkness at the edge of our solar system, evading all our efforts to spot it. Some astronomers say the strange, clustered orbits of icy rocks beyond Neptune indicate that something big is out there, which they have dubbed \"Planet Nine.\"",
      "Now, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive world has instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. And the existence of the new kid on the block could challenge the Planet Nine theory, the researchers have calculated.",
      "Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed and was\u00a0published online last week. That makes it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "An extraordinary dwarf planet discovered at the edge of our solar system @the_IAS https://t.co/B9Ia1gNxb9",
      "But that is still big enough to be considered a dwarf planet, lead study author Sihao Cheng of New Jersey's Institute for Advanced Study told AFP.",
      "\"Lucky\" discovery",
      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",
      "During its 25,000-year orbit, the object is only close enough to Earth to be observed around 0.5 percent of the time, which is roughly a century.",
      "\"It's already getting fainter and fainter,\" Cheng said.",
      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",
      "After taking a risk spending more than half a year sorting through a difficult dataset in search of Planet Nine, Cheng said he was \"lucky\" to have found anything at all.",
      "The researchers are requesting time to point the James Webb, Hubble and ALMA telescopes at their discovery.",
      "But Sam Deen, a 23-year-old amateur astronomer from California, has already been able to track the dwarf planet candidate through old datasets.",
      "\"OF201 is, in my opinion, probably one of the most interesting discoveries in the outer solar system in the last decade,\" Deen told AFP.",
      "\"See almost to the edge of the universe\"",
      "The icy rocks discovered in the Kuiper belt tend to have a clustered orbit going in a particular direction. Two decades ago, astronomers proposed this was due to the gravitational pull of a world up to 10 times larger than Earth, naming it Planet Nine and kicking off a debate that has rumbled since.",
      "It is also sometimes called Planet X, a name proposed for a hypothetical world beyond Neptune more than a century ago.",
      "Back in 1930, astronomers were searching for Planet X when they discovered Pluto, which became our solar system's ninth planet. But Pluto turned out to be too tiny \u2014 it is smaller than the moon \u2014\u00a0  and was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006.",
      "There are now four other officially recognized dwarf planets, and Cheng believes 2017 OF201 could join their ranks.",
      "When the researchers modeled its orbit, they found it did not follow the clustered trend of similar objects. This could pose a problem for the Planet Nine theory, but Cheng emphasized more data is needed.",
      "Samantha Lawler of Canada's University of Regina told AFP that this \"great discovery\" and others like it mean that \"the original argument for Planet Nine is getting weaker and weaker.\"",
      "The Vera Rubin Observatory, which is scheduled to go online in Chile this year, is expected to shed light on this mystery, one way or another.",
      "Deen said it was discouraging that no sign of Planet Nine has been found so far, but with Vera Rubin \"on the horizon I don't think we'll have to wonder about its existence for much longer.\"",
      "For Cheng, he still hopes that this huge planet is out there somewhere.",
      "\"We're in an era when big telescopes can see almost to the edge of the universe,\" he said.",
      "But what is in our \"backyard\" still largely remains unknown, he added.",
      "Cheng made the discovery alongside colleagues Jiaxuan Li and Eritas Yang from Princeton University, and Li said the newly found object demonstrates the power of open science.",
      "\"All the data we used to identify and characterize this object are archival data that are available to anyone, not only professional astronomers,\" Li said in a statement. \"This means that groundbreaking discoveries aren't limited to those with access to the world's largest telescopes. Any researcher, student, or even citizen scientist with the right tools and knowledge could have made this discovery, highlighting the value of sharing scientific resources.\"",
      "The new discovery was officially announced by the\u00a0International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center\u00a0on May 21.",

    "story": [
      "Astronomers have discovered a strange new object in our\u00a0Milky Way.",
      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves. What's more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "X-rays and radio waves are two different types of electromagnetic radiation. The correlation in their emission patterns in this case, along with other mysterious observations, led the study's authors to characterize what they found as \"unlike any known Galactic object.\"",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University's Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",
      "Or it could be \"something exotic\" and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the X-ray emissions by chance last year while focusing on a supernova remnant, or the remains of an exploded star. Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",
      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",
      "\"While our discovery doesn't yet solve the mystery of what these objects are and may even deepen it, studying them brings us closer to two possibilities,\" Wang said. \"Either we are uncovering something entirely new, or we're seeing a known type of object emitting radio and X-ray waves in a way we've never observed before.\"",
      "Launched in 1999, Chandra orbits tens of thousands of miles above Earth, observing some of the hottest, high-energy objects in the universe.",
      "It's the world's most powerful X-ray telescope, according to NASA. A description of the telescope on the space agency's website notes that its purpose is to allow scientists across the globe to obtain X-ray images of faraway environments, in hopes that the images may \"help them understand the structure and evolution of the universe.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 28 May 2025 10:05:03 -0400",
    "summary": "After back-to-back Starship upper stage failures, SpaceX on Tuesday again launched the world's most powerful rocket, but faced new problems.",
    "story": [
      "After spectacular back-to-back upper stage failures in January and March, SpaceX launched another Super Heavy-Starship rocket Tuesday on the program's ninth test flight, but ran into fresh problems that resulted in the loss of both stages before they could carry out controlled descents to splashdown.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage, following a deliberately steeper, more stressful descent trajectory toward splashdown near the Texas Gulf Coast, suffered a catastrophic failure at the moment its engines reignited for what would have been a relatively gentle splashdown.",
      "SpaceX confirmed the stage had been lost, but given the extreme nature of the testing, the loss was not an out-of-the-blue surprise. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, managed to make it into its planned suborbital trajectory after an apparently flawless performance from its six engines.",
      "But a few minutes later, a door on the side of the rocket failed to open, preventing the planned release of simulated Starlink satellites in a test of the rocket's Pez-like deployment system.",
      "With that test deferred to a future flight, SpaceX engineers hoped to reignite a single Raptor engine to test its start-up capability in space. But an apparent propellant leak put the spacecraft into a slow spin that ruled out the restart and a controlled reentry and splashdown.",
      "The Starship has to enter at the right angle and in a precise orientation to survive reentry heating and aerodynamic \"loads.\" Entering in a spin doomed the Starship to a catastrophic breakup.",
      "\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. \"Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.\"",
      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" taped shortly before Tuesday's launch, Musk told correspondent David Pogue, \"If we're lucky, we've probably got about a 50% chance of sending ... ships from Earth to Mars at the end of next year. So November, December next year, in about 18 months.\"",
      "Asked if that timeline was realistic, Musk replied, \"Well, I try to give the 50th percentile. ... So you should expect half the time I'm wrong.\" [See more of the exclusive interview with Musk on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Sunday, June 1.]",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

    "summary": "GOP Rep. Michael Bost and two Republican presidential electors challenged Illinois' decision to count mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether to revive a Republican congressman's challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day.",
      "The dispute involving GOP Rep. Michael Bost will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term, which begins in October, with a decision expected by the end of June 2026. The question in the case is a procedural one: Whether Bost and two Republican presidential electors have the legal right to challenge state regulations concerning the time, place and manner of federal elections.",
      "If the high court finds that the plaintiffs do have the legal standing to sue, their lawsuit could proceed.",
      "The case concerns an Illinois law that dictates when vote-by-mail ballots have to be postmarked and received in order for them to be counted. Changes in state law in 2005 effectively allow a mail-in ballot received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted as long as it is cast by mail on or before the day of the election. At least 17 states also allow ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted.",
      "Bost, who was first elected to Congress in 2014, and two Republican presidential electors sued Illinois election officials over the deadline for counting mail ballots in 2022. They argued in part that the receipt and counting of late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes, infringing on their rights under the First and 14th Amendments, and contended that the ballot-receipt deadline is preempted by two federal statutes that set a uniform day for federal elections.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the case in 2023, finding that Bost and the two electors failed to allege that they have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing. A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the district court's decision last year, agreeing that the plaintiffs did not allege standing to bring their lawsuit because they did not plausibly allege they had been injured by the law involving late-arriving mail ballots.",
      "Bost and the electors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that in recent years, the ability of candidates and parties to sue over state laws that affect their campaigns has been restricted by the federal courts.",
      "\"The court's guidance is needed to correct the unwarranted narrowing of candidates' ability to challenge electoral regulations,\" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court, adding that it is \"vitally important\" for the Supreme Court to clarify whether candidates can challenge state election laws in federal court.",
      "\"It is important that courts hear and resolve well-pleaded challenges by federal candidates to state time, place, and manner regulations affecting their elections,\" the Republicans wrote. \"Aside from the interests of the litigants, it is important that the public conclude that elections are run in an orderly, not arbitrary, fashion.\"",
      "But Illinois election officials urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal, arguing that the plaintiffs disagree with their decision to count mail-in ballots that are cast on or before Election Day, but arrive after.",
      "\"They do not claim that Illinois's ballot receipt deadline affected their likelihood of prevailing in any race in which they have ever competed or are likely to compete in the future,\" the state officials said in a filing with the high court. \"Rather, petitioners contend that they are entitled to challenge the deadline simply by virtue of their status as candidates, on the theory that a political candidate can always challenge a state's regulation of the time, place, and manner of conducting an election.\"",

      "The surge in steel stocks followed an announcement by Mr. Trump on Friday that he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum from the current rate of 25% to 50%. The 25% tariffs,\u00a0announced in February, were enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which gives the president authority to restrict imports he deems a national security threat. The new 50% tariffs are slated to take effect on June 4.",

      "China on Monday said the Trump administration is undermining the temporary\u00a0May 12 trade agreement between the two nations by issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and by planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "The Trump administration's actions \"seriously undermine the existing consensus reached at the Geneva economic and trade talks, and seriously damage China's legitimate rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in the June 2 statement.",
      "China's claims come after President Trump on Friday said that Beijing is violating a trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after the two countries announced on May 12 a\u00a0temporary but significant easing\u00a0of tariffs imposed on each other's imports earlier in the year. The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",
      "He added, \"The overall objectives of the trade aggression, other than the display of raw power, are as muddled as ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said he's \"confident\" a U.S.-China trade dispute \"will be ironed out\" when Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a conversation. \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\"\u00a0Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

      "May 12 tariff pause",
      "The May 12 deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause still leaves tariffs higher than before Mr. Trump\u00a0started ramping them up\u00a0last month. Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",
      "\"If the United States and China were to disengage completely in another blitz of escalating tariffs, it would be a really big deal for the global economy,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a client note. \"Demand for industrial commodities would plummet.

    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:15:34 -0400",
    "summary": "In declining to take up the case, the Supreme Court leaves intact a lower court decision upholding Maryland's ban on certain semiautomatic rifles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge to Maryland's ban on so-called assault weapons, leaving intact a lower court ruling that upheld the law.",
      "In declining to review the decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, the high court skirts for now a fight over whether the Second Amendment allows states to regulate the rifles that have been used in a wave of mass shootings. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision to turn away the case.",
      "The Supreme Court had already turned away the legal battle over Maryland's law last year because a federal appeals court had yet to rule. But the 4th Circuit upheld the measure last August, finding that weapons like the AR-15 could be banned in part because they are outside the scope of the Second Amendment.",
      "But the question of whether AR-15s are protected by the Second Amendment is likely to be soon decided by the Supreme Court. In a separate statement, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the issue is currently being considered by other federal appeals courts, and rulings from them \"should assist this court's ultimate decisionmaking.\" He predicted appeals to the Supreme Court will be before the court \"shortly,\" and said the justices \"should and presumably will address the AR-15 issue soon, in the next term or two.\"",
      "In addition to rejecting the appeal of Maryland's prohibition, the Supreme Court declined to consider a challenge to Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines, keeping the law in place. The court's decision to turn away the appeal from four gun owners and a firearms dealer leaves intact a lower court ruling that declined to block enforcement of Rhode Island's ban and found the challengers failed to show they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.",
      "The two disputes are among several to land before the Supreme Court following its June 2022 ruling that expanded the right to bear arms and laid out a new framework for determining when restrictions on firearms adhere to the Constitution.",
      "Under its new standard, the government must show that a measure is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation and is therefore allowed under the Second Amendment. The high court provided some clarification about its so-called historical tradition test in its last term when it upheld a federal law that bars alleged domestic abusers from temporarily having firearms, but courts have still struggled to apply the framework, leading to conflicting decisions on the constitutionality of longstanding gun laws.",
      "Maryland's assault-weapons ban",
      "Maryland's prohibition on certain semiautomatic rifles was enacted in the wake of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Under the law, it is a crime to possess, sell, transfer or purchase an \"assault long gun\" or a \"copycat weapon,\" which encompasses 45 specific guns or their analogues. A variety of semiautomatic handguns and rifles are still allowed, according to the Maryland State Police.",
      "In addition to Maryland, eight other states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws restricting semiautomatic weapons.",
      "A group of Maryland residents who want to buy rifles covered by the ban, a licensed gun dealer in the state and several pro-Second Amendment groups challenged the law in 2020, arguing that they have a Second Amendment right to own common assault rifles.",
      "The federal district court and U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the law, likening the banned firearms to the M-16 rifle, which the Supreme Court has said is outside the scope of Second Amendment protection.",
      "The Maryland challengers asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court put consideration on hold while it decided another gun case involving concealed carry rules in New York. In that ruling issued in June 2022, the Supreme Court laid out the new framework under which gun laws must be consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "Following its decision in that landmark gun case, the Supreme Court sent the challenge to Maryland's assault weapons back to the appeals court to reconsider the case.",
      "After applying that new framework to Maryland's ban, the 4th Circuit concluded last year that the assault weapons ban is constitutional. Focusing on the AR-15 in particular, the appeals court found that it is most useful in military service and can be banned consistent with the Second Amendment.",
      "It also rejected the challengers' contention that because the guns covered by Maryland's ban are commonly used, they are protected by the Constitution. Instead, the 4th Circuit said adopting this argument would mean that any dangerous weapon \"could gain constitutional protection merely because it becomes popular before the government can sufficiently regulate it.\"",
      "The appeals court also said that the ban is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation, as it \"is one of many in a storied tradition of legislatures perceiving threats posed by excessively dangerous weapons and regulating commensurately.\"",
      "The challengers again sought the Supreme Court's review, arguing in a filing that the justices should \"ensure that the Second Amendment itself is not truncated into a limited right to own certain state-approved means of personal self-defense.\"",
      "They argued the AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the U.S. and said the 4th Circuit's ruling \"turns a firearm possessed for lawful purposes by millions of Americans into an item with not even presumptive constitutional protection.\"",
      "But Maryland officials urged the court to leave the 4th Circuit's ruling intact, in part because they said it's too soon for the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "In his statement, Kavanaugh called the appeals court's decision \"questionable.\"",
      "\"Given that millions of Americans own AR-15s and that a significant majority of the states allow possession of those rifles, petitioners have a strong argument that AR-15s are in 'common use' by law-abiding citizens and therefore are protected by the Second Amendment,\" he wrote. \"If so, then the Fourth Circuit would have erred by holding that Maryland's ban on AR\u201315s complies with the Second Amendment.\"",
      "Thomas, in a solo dissent, said the Supreme Court should not wait to decide the constitutionality of laws outlawing AR-15s and lamented that the justices have put off addressing it for a decade.",
      "\"[F]urther percolation is of little value when lower courts in the jurisdictions that ban AR-15s appear bent on distorting this court's Second Amendment precedents,\" he wrote. \"I doubt we would sit idly by if lower courts were to so subvert our precedents involving any other constitutional right. Until we are vigilant in enforcing it, the right to bear arms will remain 'a second-class right.'\"",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines was enacted by its General Assembly in June 2022 in response to mass shootings that have upended communities nationwide in recent years. The law prohibits possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.",
      "People who had these magazines had six months to either modify them to accept no more than 10 rounds, sell them to a firearms dealer, take them out of state or turn them into law enforcement. Possession of large-capacity magazines is now considered a felony.",
      "The group of gun owners challenged the state's ban shortly before it was set to take effect, arguing it violated the Second Amendment. A federal district court judge denied the challengers' request to block the law, finding that keeping large-capacity magazines isn't conduct that is protected by the Second Amendment.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit then upheld the district court's decision, finding that the ban \"imposes no meaningful burden on the ability of Rhode Island residents to defend themselves.\" The three-judge appeals court panel also said that semiautomatic weapons outfitted with large-capacity magazines \"much more closely resemble\" the M-16 rifle, which is banned for civilian use, than traditional handguns.",
      "\"The burden on self-defense imposed by [Rhode Island's law] is no greater than the burdens of longstanding, permissible arms regulations, and its justification compares favorably with the justification for prior bans on other arms found to pose growing threats to public safety,\" the court said. It added that, when applying the Supreme Court's framework, \"our analogical reasoning very likely places LCMs well within the realm of devices that have historically been prohibited once their danger became manifest.\"",
      "The gun owners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lower courts have \"rubber-stamped\" firearms restrictions even in the wake of the high court's more recent decisions.",
      "\"The same law-abiding citizens who were unconstitutionally deprived of their right to carry arms outside the home before Bruen continue to be deprived of their right to keep arms that are common in the rest of the country,\" they wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court, citing the court's Jun 2022 decision. \"The result is a nation that remains split, with the Second Amendment alive and well in (most of) the vast middle, but routinely disregarded near the coasts.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials urged the Supreme Court to reject the case, saying it is not worthy of the court's attention \"at this time.\" They noted in a filing that the case arrived at the high court while proceedings are still in preliminary stages.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 08:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The bill containing Trump's tax cuts and border and defense spending is expected to face some hurdles in the Senate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate this week is taking up the massive budget package containing President Trump's second-term agenda, a measure that squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. Its path through the Senate seems destined to be similarly narrow, with the package almost certain to be revised, since parts of it are opposed by a handful of GOP senators critical to its passage.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, recently ventured to the other side of the U.S. Capitol to remind Republican senators \"that we are one team\" and pleaded with them to keep the bill substantially intact.",
      "\"I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House,\" Johnson said in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, acknowledged that balance, but told reporters \"the Senate will have its imprint\" on the bill. He can afford three \"no\" votes from Republicans if all Democrats vote to block its passage in the Senate, and there are no absences.",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has already indicated he opposes the bill because it will \"explode the debt.\" Including interest, the House bill would increase the debt by $3.1 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Similar to the House, in the Senate, there are Republicans who think there's not enough cost cutting, while others argue some provisions are too draconian.",
      "These are the key sticking points as the legislation moves to the Senate:",
      "Medicaid changes",
      "Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Josh Hawley of Missouri are among the Republicans who have expressed concern about some of the changes to Medicaid, a government program that provides health care to low-income Americans as well as those with disabilities. And the trio of senators supported an amendment to the budget resolution earlier this year that would have removed the language instructing the committee overseeing Medicaid to make $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.",
      "The House-passed legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. It also requires states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and it would penalize states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. The bill also seeks to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes, among other changes.",
      "While these Senate Republicans have generally been supportive of the work requirements, some have warned that they will not support the bill if it includes any cuts to Medicaid benefits.",
      "In a New York Times opinion piece published earlier this month, Hawley called \"slashing health insurance for the working poor\" both \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\"",
      "A handful of senators have also warned of the impact of freezing provider taxes at current levels, since states use the taxes to help fund their share of Medicaid costs, although Murkowski has expressed support for this. Hawley said he's concerned about the impact on rural hospitals, while also voicing opposition to new copay requirements for beneficiaries.",
      "\"I don't like the idea of decreasing funding for rural hospitals. I'm worried that the House bill goes way too far in that regard,\" Hawley said in a CNN interview. \"I also don't like what is basically a hidden tax on working poor people who are trying to get health care. I mean, this whole idea of we're going to charge them now additional copays in order to access healthcare \u2014 I have to say, that just sounds like a tax to me.\"",
      "Deeper spending cuts",
      "Meanwhile, a number of fiscal hawks have balked at the bill's spending cuts or even threatened to oppose the measure without securing deeper cuts, echoing the frustration expressed on the other side of the Capitol by members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus throughout negotiations on the package.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said the package's aim to cut $1.5 trillion \"isn't squat, quite honestly.\" And Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has also rebuffed the cuts, saying the amount is \"not going to do it.\"",
      "\"Their bill would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it,\" Scott told reporters earlier this month, adding that the upper chamber should go through every line in the budget to find savings.",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said \"the job of the Senate is to try to increase the cuts in spending,\" calling the House cuts a \"great start\" while urging the Senate to hit $2 trillion. And Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told the network that he believes \"the Senate is going to cut spending more than the House.\"",
      "\"We're going to see the Senate be more fiscally conservative,\" Cruz added.",
      "Rolling back IRA clean energy tax credits",
      "The House-passed bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, including an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. But the provisions could face opposition in the upper chamber.",
      "Last month, Murkowksi, along with GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, penned a letter to the Senate majority leader to \"emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.\"",
      "\"While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,\" the group wrote.",
      "Tillis told reporters after the House passed the bill that the Senate needs to \"look at the specifics\" of revising the clean energy tax credits, saying \"we've got to make sure the businesses who believe the government was setting this as a priority don't have a lot of stranded costs.\"",
      "At the same time, other Senate Republicans, like Johnson, have called for eliminating the clean energy tax credits, setting up a possible clash within the conference.",
      "State and local tax deduction",
      "Among the provisions that spurred extensive debate in the House was one allowing residents to deduct more in state and local taxes on their federal returns, known as SALT. Divisions over an increase to the SALT cap threatened to sink the package in the days leading up to its passage in the lower chamber as a handful of blue-state Republicans fought for a higher cap, ultimately settling for $40,000, an increase from $10,000.",
      "In the Senate, the deduction is not an issue, since none of the blue states have Republican senators. Accordingly, a number of Senate Republicans have indicated that they oppose its inclusion in the bill.",
      "\"Eliminate it,\" Johnson, the Wisconsin senator, told reporters of the SALT cap increase.",
      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told The Hill that the cap could potentially be cut in half once the Senate makes its changes.",
      "But the House speaker said he warned senators that changing the provision would not only risk getting it through the lower chamber again, but also the Republican majority.",
      "\"In the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents,\" the Louisiana Republican told \"Face the Nation.\" \"Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House, and so, this is political reality.\"",
      "Debt ceiling",
      "Fiscal hawks are also unhappy with the inclusion of a provision raising the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. The debate comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act.",
      "Paul has been the most vocal in opposing an increase to the debt limit. The Kentucky Republican has said \"there's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before.\" Paul said he could be convinced to support the package if the debt ceiling provision is removed and voted on separately.",
      "Instead, Paul has proposed a short-term increase of $500 billion, raising the debt ceiling for a matter of months, which he said would allow conservatives to verify that spending cuts have actually been implemented before approving a further hike.",
      "\"If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?\" Paul said\u00a0Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"",
      "Paul's Senate colleague, Johnson, also backs splitting the package into multiple parts, as well as a smaller, short-term extension.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The package also cuts billions in federal dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The change will require states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries. Currently, the program is fully funded by the federal government, although states take on some of the cost to administer it. Beginning in 2028, states will have to chip in for the program as well.",
      "\"That's something that I heard some members voice concern about,\" Sen. John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, said before Memorial Day. \"So, we'll need to address that.\"",

    "story": [
      "A suspect is in custody after what the FBI is calling a \"targeted act of violence\" during a peaceful march in support of Israeli hostages at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday.",
      "Witnesses said the suspect used a \"makeshift flamethrower\" and threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims, police and the FBI said. Boulder police say eight people were injured.",
      "The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday evening. Soliman was allegedly heard yelling \"Free Palestine\" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said that it was \"clear this is a targeted act of violence\" and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism.",
      "Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, multiple sources told CBS News. That original visa expired in February 2023, the sources said. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs.",
      "The FBI said later Sunday night it was \"conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder\" in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located.",
      "A walk to remember the\u00a0Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza\u00a0was taking place in Boulder's downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also allegedly yelled \"End Zionist!\" during the attack.",
      "The victims of the attack included four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, police said. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be \"safe to say\" that person was in critical condition.",
      "Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a \"very loving person.\" Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.",
      "The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward.",
      "UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged.",
      "Following the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall.",
      "Omer Shachar, Run for Their Lives Denver co-leader, told CBS News the group reached out to Boulder police about security concerns surrounding the walk several times before Sunday's event. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said around 3:30 p.m. that FBI agents were at the scene.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media, \"The @ODNIgov's National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked \"simply because they were Jews\" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute \"the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law,\" according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a \"heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.\"",
      "\"As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,\" Polis said. \"Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Run For Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, \"This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release.\" The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video.",
      "Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they've been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages\u00a0each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday's walk.",
      "Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them.",
      "\"So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,\" said Victor.",
      "Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.",
      "\"I saw the aftermath,\" said street performer Peter Irish. \"It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.\"",
      "University of Colorado system President Todd Saliman said in a statement Sunday, \"My deepest sympathies go out tonight to those keeping weekly vigil who were viciously attacked in Boulder today. I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today's violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.\"",
      "A joint statement from Boulder's Jewish community said:",
      "We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza.",
      "We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed.",
      "Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.",
      "We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured.",
      "We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.",
      "Strength to you all.",
      "Attorney General Phil Weiser denounced the attack and offered to help the victims in a release Sunday afternoon.",
      "My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today's attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza.",
      "From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted. I have been in touch with Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and have offered support from the Attorney General's Office.",
      "People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts\u2014which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home\u2014must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.",

    "summary": "WorldPride is in D.C. this year, leaving the LGBTQ community conflicted about showing up to the nation's capital amid an administration that has targeted them.",
    "story": [
      "This year, WorldPride is coming to Washington, D.C. A series of events, organized by the nonprofit InterPride, aims to bring visibility and awareness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer issues to an international stage. This year's location is leaving the community conflicted about showing up to the nation's capital amid an administration that has targeted them.",
      "Zoe Stoller, a licensed social worker based in Philadelphia, said they're excited to be among the queer and trans community at WorldPride, but told CBS News the Trump administration has \"definitely been on my mind.\"",
      "\"D.C. is not necessarily a place that many people would think of as super safe and comfortable right now, given the current administration and their attacks on the LGBTQ community, especially trans people, especially trans youth,\" they said.",
      "Meg Ten Eyck, founder and CEO of travel platform\u00a0EveryQueer and vice chairman of the board of directors for the International LGBTQ Travel Association, has been to dozens of Pride events across the world, from the miles-long parade at New York City's WorldPride to a Pride in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2015 that was targeted with Molotov cocktails amid protests.",
      "\"What is happening socially and politically changes the feeling of the Pride that you are attending,\" she said, adding she anticipates WorldPride this year is going to bring \"an astronomical amount of fear and sadness from people\" as well as some potential violence.",
      "\"I think the community is terrified, and I think our instinct as humans is to want structure and to want answers,\" she said. \"There will be a lot of people who are drawn to this particular pride as a giant 'F*** you' to the administration, and there will be a lot of people who are incentivized into negative behaviors that may not necessarily be characteristic of who they are because of that fear and misinformation and general dissatisfaction with human rights violations that are happening in a lot of different ways.\"",
      "Comments across social media have also highlighted the mixed emotions.",
      "In a video about WorldPride\u00a0posted to TikTok\u00a0earlier this month, a top comment with more than 2,000 likes says: \"Being real... I'm not going this year. I'm scared.\" Another reads: \"Couldn't pay me enough to attend a mass gathering like this in this political climate.\"",
      "But others had a different take, including this commenter who wrote: \"Don't let them make us scared we deserve happiness too.\"",
      "While some may choose to skip this year's events due to safety concerns, Stoller predicts their absence will be filled with others eager to take a stand.",
      "\"Folks who may not have attended in the past, might not have felt motivated to show up, to protest, to be in this current political climate and make their voices heard \u2014 those folks might come out of the woodworks,\" they said.",
      "For those with layered identities, navigating Pride this year is even more complex.",
      "David D. Marshall, founder and CEO of Journey to Josiah Inc., a Baltimore-based adoption nonprofit, said the feeling of a \"robust need to fight\" is met with the reality that, for people of color, showing up is a \"a whole different experience\" to White LGBTQ people.",
      "\"There is a fear in general when it comes to Black people, because there is a direct target put on our backs when it comes to any sort of protest,\" he said, adding \"it's a time for people of different privilege, or allies, to show up.\"",
      "And for others, more pressing matters are taking precedence over the problems posed by Pride.",
      "\"When we're thinking about the grand scheme of things, (Pride) just hasn't been on the list,\" Marshall admitted, adding his own organization is grappling with federal funding cuts and those in his circles are \"fighting to maintain our own livelihoods\" amid the dismantling of DEI \u2014 diversity, equity and inclusion \u2014 roles.",
      "\"The option to fold is not there, because the work still needs to be done. The need has not gone anywhere but there are now some additional barriers,\" he said.",
      "Why is WorldPride in D.C.?",
      "While the Trump administration has rolled back several protections for LGBTQ people, especially for trans individuals, WorldPride locations are bid on years in advance, meaning the nation's capital was decided before President Trump was re-elected.",
      "\"No one could have anticipated what was going to happen,\" Ten Eyck said, adding there are fears around what the administration may do if there are protests on federal land, since it would be their jurisdiction. \"(For some people), federal charges result in you losing your career and your income and your stability.\"",
      "But there's an important distinction between who's in office and who makes up the city, she added.",
      "\"Yeah, Trump has the White House and sort of lives in D.C., but the District of Columbia goes deeply democratic in every single election, regardless of who's in the federal administration. So, having and hosting a large global pride celebration is aligned with the citizens of D.C.'s politic and will, but it is not aligned with the federal government stance.\"",
      "Stoller, who has more than 50,000 Instagram followers, has seen this contrast causing discussions among their online community as well, with many questioning whether it's safe or appropriate to attend.",
      "\"D.C. still can be a very safe, open, accepting place. But of course, the people who are in charge, who now are living in D.C. definitely affect the vibes and feelings of that,\" they said.",
      "The Trump administration has already made itself known ahead of the celebration. Last month, several Pride events at the Kennedy Center were canceled or relocated as the institution pivots under President Trump's leadership.",
      "June Crenshaw, deputy director of nonprofit organization Capital Pride Alliance that is helping host to WorldPride, said the organization is finding other paths for the celebration, but added, \"the fact we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\"",
      "According to the WorldPride website, \"top-to-bottom safety protocol\" is in place, assuring the same level of preparation as high-security events like inaugurations.",
      "\"Efforts include pre-event web-related surveillance, on-site security/police, advanced life support stations, roving medic teams, aerial surveillance and anti-scaling systems and barricades where applicable,\" the site notes. \"The 2-day street festival will be fenced with a secure entrance. Capital Pride is augmenting DC's efforts with additional private security.\"",
      "How to celebrate Pride outside of Washington, D.C.",
      "If unsure about attending WorldPride this year, Stroller encourages people to prioritize their emotional and physical safety above all else.",
      "\"If you are feeling worried for your safety, for your emotions, for your well-being, listen to your gut,\" they said.",
      "Black LGBTQ people are also having to figure out another approach \"that may not necessarily be showing up in these very public spaces,\" Marshall added.",
      "\"Does that mean that one group has decided not to fight? No, it's a matter of how. What is going to be the thing that is not going to cost us our lives?\" he said.",
      "Ten Eyck adds there are plenty of ways to \"show up\" for the community without being in Washington physically, including supporting your local Pride party or LGBT center as well as \"putting your money where your morals are.\"",
      "\"If you're a federal employee who can fight from the inside, if you're a teacher who can fight from the inside, if you're a public health professional who can fight from the inside, we need you more in those roles than we need you on the National Mall,\" she said.",

      "Amid the wave of pardons and commutations President Trump has doled out to some of his supporters and surrogates, one former MAGA loyalist in Idaho is fighting to return her pardon.",
      "Pamela Hemphill is one of the more than 1,500 people whom Mr. Trump pardoned earlier this year for their roles in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection. She has invoked help from her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon Mr. Trump issued her on Jan. 20, his\u00a0first day back in the White House.",
      "Though Hemphill was a defendant of the largest criminal prosecution in American history, she is seemingly standing alone now as the only Jan. 6 defendant to refuse the clemency Mr. Trump offered.",
      "Speaking with CBS News from her home in Idaho, Hemphill said, \"The pardons just contribute to their narrative, which is all lies, propaganda. We were guilty, period.\"",
      "\"We all know that they're gaslighting us. They are using January 6 to just continue Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized,\" she said. \"They were not. When the FBI came to my home, oh my God, they were very professional. They treated me very good.\"",
      "Hemphill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the crowd on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Prosecutors argued Hemphill \"was in the front of the crowd that confronted U.S. Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers attempting to keep the rioters behind the metal bike-rack barriers.\"",
      "They alleged Hemphill galvanized others to descend on Washington for the certification of the electoral vote after the 2020 election, according to court filings.",
      "\"On December 28, 2020, Hemphill posted encouragement to go to Washington, D.C. for January 6, saying 'its a WAR!' On January 1, 2021, she posted a message 'on my way to Washington DC January 6th,'\" the prosecution said.",
      "Hemphill also pleaded guilty in January 2022 to a count of unlawful parading and was sentenced later that year to a term that included three years of probation.",
      "Her case mirrors many other misdemeanor cases from the U.S. Capitol siege, in which members of the crowd were not accused of making physical contact with police or damaging any property \u2014 though prosecutors emphasized how each member of the mob contributed to the breakdown of police lines, the injuries and the damage to American democracy.",
      "Hemphill told CBS News the pardons for her and fellow members of the crowd were inappropriate and damaging Americans' views of the federal government.",
      "\"How could you sleep at night taking a pardon when you know you were guilty? You know that everybody there was guilty. I couldn't live with myself. I have to be right with me. And with God,\" Hemphill said.",
      "Former Pardon Attorney Liz Oyer, who was fired by the Trump administration in March after a disagreement over a case, told CBS News that Hemphill's protest is a sharp contrast from the conduct of other Capitol riot defendants who championed their own pardons.",
      "\"Some Jan. 6 defendants blew up our phones seeking a copy of their pardons. They wanted the copies quickly,\" Oyer said. \"They wanted it framed and signed.\"",
      "Court filings reviewed by CBS News show other Jan. 6 defendants have utilized their pardon certificates to make arguments in court about their cases, restitution payments or other legal matters.",
      "In contrast, senate records obtained by CBS News show Hemphill sought assistance from Sen. James Risch to secure a formal acknowledgement from the Department of Justice that she will not accept her pardon.",
      "In an April 2 correspondence from the Office of the Pardon Attorney to Sen. Risch, the pardon attorney's office wrote, \"Ms. Hemphill's non-acceptance is noted.\" The letter said the Justice Department would not issue Hemphill a formal certificate to chronicle her pardon.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Risch said, \"The Office of U.S. Senator Jim Risch regularly assists constituents with matters pertaining to federal agencies or programs. Due to privacy concerns, we cannot disclose details about individual cases.\"",
      "Hemphill has sparred on social media and in podcasts with other Jan. 6 defendants over her arguments about what she says is the whitewashing of the Capitol riot. In one segment on a podcast earlier this spring, Hemphill debated Enrique Tarrio, a former Proud Boys leader who was convicted at trial and received the longest prison sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Tarrio's sentence was commuted by Mr. Trump.",
      "Hemphill told CBS News she expects her protest will garner the attention of the president.",
      "\"Trump will probably say that ungrateful lady, I'm going to make sure she gets back on probation and give her the worst you can give her. I won't be surprised,\" she said.",

      "The approval \"adds an important new tool to help protect people at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19,\" Stephane Bancel, Moderna's CEO, said in a statement Saturday.",

      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",

    "summary": "A British military spending boost, including new attack subs and long-range weapons, will make the U.K. \"a battle-ready, armor-clad nation,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer says.",
    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 The United Kingdom will build as many as a dozen new nuclear-powered attack submarines, get its army ready to fight a war in Europe and become \"a battle-ready, armor-clad nation,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed on Monday. The promise is part of a planned military spending boost \u2014\u00a0echoed recently by other close U.S. allies in Europe\u00a0\u2014 designed to send a message to both Moscow, and to President Trump in Washington.",
      "Starmer said Britain \"cannot ignore the threat that Russia poses\" as he pledged to undertake the most sweeping changes to Britain's defenses since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than three decades ago.",
      "\"The threat we face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer told workers and journalists at a navy shipyard in Scotland.",
      "Like other NATO members, the U.K. has been reassessing its defense spending since Russia launched its ongoing, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The government announced its plans for the military in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It was the first such review since 2021, and it landed in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and by the reelection of Mr. Trump last year.",
      "Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared that the era of \"fighting big tank battles on European landmass\" was over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.",
      "Starmer's center-left Labour Party government has said it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and cyberspace.",
      "The measures include increasing production of submarines and weapons and \"learning the lessons of Ukraine,\" which has rapidly developed its drone technology to counter Moscow's forces and even hit targets deep inside Russia. Starmer made his announcement a day after Ukraine launched a drone attack of unprecedented scale against Russian air bases, claiming to have damaged or destroyed 41 Russian bombers.",
      "The government said the U.K. will also establish a cyber command to counter \"daily\" Russia-linked attacks on Britain's defenses.",
      "Monday's announcements include building \"up to 12\" nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds (about $20.3 billion) in Britain's nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret.",
      "The government will also increase conventional Britain's weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.",
      "Starmer said rearming would create a \"defense dividend\" of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs \u2014 a contrast to the post-Cold War \"peace dividend\" that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \"a message to Moscow,\" and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a two-century low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.",
      "Healey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \"on track\" and that there's \"no doubt\" it will hit 3% before 2034.",
      "Starmer said the 3% goal is an \"ambition,\" rather than a firm promise, and it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.",
      "Starmer said he wouldn't make a firm pledge until he knew \"precisely where the money is coming from.\"",
      "Even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.",
      "It's also a message to Mr. Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defense.",
      "European countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Mr. Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Mr. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don't pull their weight.",
      "Starmer said his government would make \"Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation.\"",
      "\"We will never fight alone,\" he said. \"Our defense policy will always be NATO-first.\"",
      "James Cartlidge, defense spokesman for the main British opposition Conservative Party, welcomed more money for defense but was skeptical of the government's 3% pledge.",
      "\"All of Labour's strategic defense review promises will be taken with a pinch of salt unless they can show there will actually be enough money to pay for them,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine's shock\u00a0drone attack on Russian military air bases, including some deep inside Russian territory, which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was secretly planned and coordinated from inside Russia over the past 18 months, seemed on Monday to have left the Kremlin speechless.",
      "Russia's state-run media cited the country's defense ministry as saying Monday that forces had struck Ukrainian drone production, launch and storage sites, and claiming to have shot down hundreds of Ukrainian-launched drones over the past 24 hours, but there was no direct public response from Russian authorities to the Ukrainian strike.",
      "While Ukraine has launched drones at Russia, including the capital Moscow, for months, as well as staging other covert operations on Russian soil, the attack on Sunday was notable for its scope and scale. Ukraine claimed it had damaged or destroyed 41 Russian bomber aircraft at bases across the vast country. Ukrainian officials said the attack did not endanger any Russian civilians.",

      "Ukraine gains support as U.N. panel accuses Russia of war crimes",
      "The head of Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency said in a statement on Tuesday that Russia \"thought that it could bomb Ukraine and endlessly kill Ukrainians with impunity. But that is not the case. We will respond to Russian terror and destroy the enemy everywhere \u2014 at sea, in the air, and on land.\"",
      "SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk claimed in the statement that Ukraine had hit aircraft at four Russian bases, inflicting more than $7 billion worth of damage on Russia's bomber fleet.",
      "The Ministry of Defense in Moscow said Monday that Russia's air defenses had intercepted a total of 316 Ukrainian drones in 24 hours, which encompasses the time of Ukraine's attack. The Russian ministry said 205 of those drones were hit outside the \"special operation zone,\" a term the Kremlin uses to refer to land it has seized since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Ukrainian authorities said that, before dawn on Monday, Russia launched two ballistic missiles and a series of drones at the northeast city of Kharkiv, just miles from the Russian border, wounding at least six people, including a child.",
      "Separately, Russia's military claimed more than 1,400 Ukrainian troops were killed in northern Ukraine over the preceding day.",
      "Russia and Ukraine hold 2nd round of talks in Turkey",
      "Despite the sharp escalation in the war making any breakthrough appear even less likely than it had before, Russian and Ukrainian delegations did sit down opposite each other Monday in Istanbul for the second round of negotiations in a bid for peace.",
      "Ukraine's representatives, led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, were expected to present a plan demanding a \"full and unconditional ceasefire in the sky, on land and at sea as a necessary background and prerequisite for peace negotiations,\" the Reuters news agency said, citing a text of the Ukrainian proposal it had viewed. The proposed truce would last a minimum of 30 days, in line with calls made by the Trump administration previously.",
      "Ukraine was also expected to demand the unconditional return of all Ukrainian children and civilian hostages taken during the war, and that territorial gains made by Russia since February 2014, when Russia first invaded and illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula, not be recognized by the international community.",
      "In return, Ukraine is open to the lifting of \"some sanctions\" imposed against Russia by the U.S. and its allies, \"but in stages and only gradually, with a mechanism for resuming sanctions if necessary.\"",
      "The Ukrainians also want Russian sovereign assets frozen by Western nations to be used for reconstruction, or to remain frozen until reparations are paid.",
      "Moscow did not, going into the second round of talks on Monday, reveal any new conditions or terms for a hypothetical ceasefire.",
      "President Vladimir Putin's government has insisted for months that the only way to end the war is to address what it vaguely calls the conflict's \"root causes.\" Russia insists the war, which Putin calls only a \"special military operation,\" was caused by NATO's ambitions for further eastward expansion, and by Moscow's desire to defend Russian-speaking Ukrainians in the eastern part of the neighboring nation.",
      "Putin and his senior aides routinely dismiss pro-Europe, pro-NATO Zelenskyy as an illegitimate leader of Ukraine. The Russian president has refused to accept his Ukrainian counterpart's challenge to hold direct personal talks, face-to-face.",
      "Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday as the talks got underway that discussions over such a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting \"will be considered.\"",
      "But there was no confirmation from either Ukraine or Russia that such a high-level dialogue was imminent. Instead, reports from Turkey suggested the second round of talks had concluded in just over an hour. Zelenskyy, who did not attend the negotiations, told reporters during a visit Monday to Lithuania, however, that a new prisoner swap between the warring sides was being organized.",
      "He did not say how far the planning for a swap had gone, but a significant exchange late last month of about 1,000 captured civilians and prisoners of war was the only tangible result of the first round of talks between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "President Trump has voiced frustration with both Zelenskyy and Putin for failing to agree to a truce. During last year's election campaign, Mr. Trump vowed repeatedly to broker an end of the war within hours of taking office. The U.S. president recently issued rare sharp criticism of Putin, calling him \"absolutely crazy\" for continuing to hammer Ukrainian cities with missiles as the U.S. and its partners push for a peace agreement.",
      "Mr. Trump wondered in a social media post during the last prisoner swap whether it, \"could lead to something big?\"",
      "Russian officials were quoted by the country's state-run media as saying the two sides agreed on Monday to hold a third round of talks, but no date was set. The officials acknowledged that future prisoner swaps had been a key point of discussion, but Ukrainian officials said Russia had rejected the call for a broader 30-day ceasefire.",
      "There was no immediate reaction from the White House to the second round of negotiations in Turkey on Monday, but the Trump administration did make it clear that Ukraine had given no advance warning of the Sunday drone attack ahead of those talks.",

      "More than 50 people were killed and scores were wounded on Sunday after an attack near a food aid distribution center in the\u00a0Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and multiple witnesses. The Israeli military denied claims that its soldiers were involved.",
      "The people were on their way to receive food when they were fired at around 1,000 yards from an aid site in Rafah run by an Israel-backed foundation, witnesses told the Associated Press.",
      "\"There was fire from all directions, from naval warships, from tanks and drones,\" said Amr Abu Teiba, who was in the crowd.",
      "He said he saw at least 10 bodies with gunshot wounds and several other wounded people, including women. People used carts to ferry the dead and wounded to the field hospital. \"The scene was horrible,\" he said.",
      "At least 51 people were killed and more than 170 were wounded, CBS News has learned.",
      "Israel's military said in a statement that its forces did not fire at civilians near or within the site, citing an initial inquiry.",
      "The IDF also says Hamas is hoarding food aid for itself and its families in the Gaza Strip, saying, \"Hamas does everything in its power to undermine food distribution efforts in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "The U.S. and Israeli-backed\u00a0Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)\u00a0said in a statement that it delivered aid 16 truckloads of aid \"without incident\" early on Sunday and dismissed what it referred to as \"false reporting about deaths, mass injuries and chaos\" around its sites, which are in Israeli military zones where independent access is limited.",
      "Before Sunday, the GHF distribution of aid had been marred by chaos, and multiple witnesses have said Israeli troops fired on crowds near delivery sites, the AP reported.",
      "The foundation says the private security contractors guarding its sites have not fired on the crowds, while the Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots on previous occasions.",
      "Israel and the United States say the new system is aimed at preventing Hamas from siphoning off assistance. Israel has not provided any evidence of systematic diversion, and the United Nations denies it has occurred.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to work with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, risking yet more mass displacement in the territory.",
      "The U.N. system has struggled to bring in aid after Israel slightly eased its total blockade of the territory last month. Those groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "Experts have warned that the territory is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.",
      "Ceasefire talks falter",
      "Sunday's incident happened as Israel and Hamas traded blame for the faltering mediation bid to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Hamas said Saturday it was seeking amendments to a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, but President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East rejected the group's response as \"totally unacceptable.\"",
      "\"Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,\" the office of Steve Witkoff said in a statement.",
      "Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said in a statement that Hamas did not reject Witkoff's proposal.",
      "\"Nevertheless, we now responded positively and responsibly in a manner that fulfilled the minimum of demands and aspirations of our people,\" Naim said in a statement. \"Why, each time, is the Israeli response considered the only response for negotiation? This violates the integrity and fairness of mediation and constitutes a complete bias towards the other side.\"",

They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",
      "Israel's military campaign has killed over 54,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants.

The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",

    "summary": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki narrowly won Poland's presidential runoff election, beating Warsaw's liberal mayor, according to the final vote count. Nawrocki was backed by President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Warsaw, Poland \u2014 Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%.",
      "The race had Poland on edge since a first round of voting two weeks earlier, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.",
      "An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture a couple of hours later.",
      "The outcome suggests Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by President Trump.",
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban lauded Nawrocki's win, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Nawrocki. In a post on X, she said she's \"confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland.\"",
      "Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister, who is chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.",
      "Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.",
      "Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide \u2014 so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples.",
      "But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared undemocratic.",
      "Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made both to voters and the EU.",
      "Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.",
      "Incoming president's background",
      "Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.",
      "The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who wouldn't be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule.",
      "The strategy clearly worked.",
      "Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with.",
      "Nawrocki's candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \"noble\" fights in his life. The revelations didn't seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Nawrocki endorsed by Trump",
      "Mr. Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president.",
      "He welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week, the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.",
      "A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \"normality,\" as they believe Mr. Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Nawrocki has also echoed some of Mr. Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.",
      "For his part, Zelenskyy said Monday he wants to work with Nawrocki, AFP reported. \"I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation with Poland and with President Nawrocki personally,\" Zelensky said in social media post.",
      "NATO chief Mark Rutte congratulated Nawrocki on Monday, vowing to work together to boost the alliance in the face of the threat from Russia, according to AFP.",

    "summary": "At 37 she became the world's youngest female head of government. Now a fellow at Harvard University, Jacinda Ardern talks about the importance of exhibiting kindness and empathy in politics.",
    "story": [
      "These days, at her local coffee shop near Boston, Jacinda Ardern can be just another customer. \"I don't put my name on the order; it's too complicated!\" she laughed.",
      "I asked, \"When you order coffee here, do people start talking politics with you?\"",
      "\"No. Not at all,\" Ardern replied. \"In fact, the guy behind the counter said to me, 'Ah, you are really familiar. Oh, I know: Toni Collette!'\"",
      "That's a moment that would never happen in New Zealand, where Ardern became the world's youngest female head of government when she was just 37 years old. Now 44, former Prime Minister Ardern has been living in the U.S. since she left office two years ago. She is serving as a fellow at Harvard University, and has written a new book, \"A Different Kind of Power\" (to be published June 3 by Crown).",
      "Of the title, she says, \"I think, you know, there are different ways to lead. But I hope you also see that some of those character traits that we perhaps bring to it that we might believe to be weaknesses \u2013 imposter syndrome, or even empathy \u2013 actually are incredible strengths.\"",
      "Ardern says her story is about finding her voice in New Zealand, a small nation of about five million people. \"I never, ever saw myself becoming prime minister, ever,\" she said.",
      "In fact, her father told Ardern that she was too \"thin-skinned\" for politics.",
      "Was he right? \"He was absolutely right!\" she laughed. \"But I guess where I corrected him is, your sensitivity is your empathy. And goodness, don't we need a bit more of that?\"",
      "In New Zealand, the answer was yes. Ahead of the 2017 election, Ardern suddenly became the leader of her country's left-leaning Labour Party. Weeks after winning, she made an announcement: she was pregnant. Her journey, alongside her then-partner, now-husband, Clarke, soon won her global attention.",
      "Was she comfortable with the symbolism of her role? Ardern said, \"I realized the importance of it when I first received a letter from someone on their way to work to tell their boss that they were having a baby, and they felt nervous about their boss' view of whether they could do their job When she heard that I was pregnant, and that gave her a level of confidence, you know, I felt like I also needed to show I could do the job and be a mother.\"",
      "But those joyful early days were followed by challenges. In 2019, mass shootings targeting Muslims in Christchurch left more than 50 dead \u2013 a crucible for New Zealand, and a call to action for its leader: a ban on semi-automatic weapons.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you believe you and your colleagues in New Zealand were able to achieve gun control reform in the wake of a horrific mass shooting, but so often here in the United States such legislative changes have been hard to get?\"",
      "\"I can't speak to the U.S. experience,\" Ardern replied, \"but if we really wanted to say, 'We don't ever want this to happen again,' we needed to demonstrate what we were doing to make that a reality.\"",
      "But even after she won another election, things weren't easy. As the pandemic wore on, tensions flared over her government's COVID policies. In 2023, when she stunned many by deciding to resign, she wore her heart on her sleeve, telling Parliament: \"You can be a nerd, a cryer, a hugger, you can be all of these things, and not only can you be here, you can lead, just like me.\"",
      "Though she has left office, she has not stopped keeping a close eye on our turbulent ties. Asked what she makes of President Trump and his decisions on trade and foreign policy, Ardern said, \"You know, we are seeing people experience deep financial insecurity, and that has to be addressed by political leaders. But I continue to hold that ideas of isolation or protectionism or closing ourselves off to remedy the issue actually doesn't remedy it in the long term, and has a long-term negative impact for some of the collective issues we need to address as a global community.\"",
      "For now, Ardern is not angling to jump back into politics, but she is settling into her new normal \u2013 that is, \"Being just a normal family.\"",
      "And when she is asked for advice \u2013 in a Harvard classroom, or from a world leader \u2013 Jacinda Ardern tells them to be kind: \"That principle of kindness, it's something we teach our kids. Why shouldn't we role model that in the way that we conduct ourselves in politics? And secondly, if you're putting people at the center of what you're doing, it's a reminder that, actually, the act of being in politics is an act of public service as well. And I think voters need to see more of that.\"",

      "In a statement, the militant group said its response aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, the Israeli military's complete withdrawal from Gaza and the \"unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid.\" Hamas said in their statement that the agreement would include the release of 10 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 18 hostages in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners.",
      "A senior Hamas official tells The Associated Press that \"there some notes and amendments to some points, especially on the U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.",
      "The office of Steve Witkoff, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East, said in a statement on social media on Saturday that it had received Hamas' response to the proposal, but it was \"totally unacceptable and only takes us backward.\"",
      "\"Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,\" the statement said. \"That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families and in which we can have at the proximity talks substantive negotiations in good-faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire.\"",

      "\"Nevertheless, we now responded positively and responsibly in a manner that fulfilled the minimum of demands and aspirations of our people,\" Naim said in a statement. \"Why, each time, is the Israeli response considered the only response for negotiation? This violates the integrity and fairness of mediation and constitutes a complete bias towards the other side.\"",
      "A\u00a0draft of the deal obtained by CBS News\u00a0indicated that Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners and 1,111 Palestinian detainees as part of the deal, as well as 180 deceased Palestinians. The draft also outlined that humanitarian aid will be sent into Gaza immediately once Hamas agrees to the deal.",

      "\"After nearly 80 days of total blockade, communities are starving \u2013 and they are no longer willing to watch food pass them by,\" the WFP said in a statement. \"This delivery is a start, but it's not nearly enough.\"",
      "A nearly three-month Israeli blockade on Gaza has pushed the population of nearly 2.3 million people to the brink of famine. While the pressure slightly eased in recent days as Israel allowed some aid to enter, organizations say there still isn't nearly enough food getting in.",

Most people carried bags of flour on their backs or heads. He said at one point a forklift was used to offload pallets from the stranded trucks. The witness spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisal.",

On Friday, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said it only picked up five truckloads of cargo from the Palestinian side of the Kareem Shalom crossing, and the other 60 trucks had to return due to intense hostilities in the area.",
      "An Israeli official said his country has offered the U.N. logistical and operational support but \"the U.N. is not doing their job.\" Instead, a new U.S- and Israeli-backed foundation started operations in Gaza this week, distributing food at several sites in a chaotic rollout. Israel says\u00a0the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\u00a0will replace the massive aid operation that the U.N. and others have carried out throughout the war.",

      "\"These people are desperate, and they see a World Food Programme truck coming in, and they run for it,\" she said. \"This doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organized crime, or anything. It has simply to do with the fact these people are starving to death.\"",

      "The report, shared with Fox News Digital, details how 41 DEI consultant groups garnered millions in taxpayer-funded contracts from 303 school districts and public education entities from 2021 until now.",
      "In total, the groups collected over $123 million from public schools in 40 states. The report found public school DEI contracts in both red and blue states, from Florida and Alabama to California and Washington.",

      "According to the report, the biggest winner in the scheme was Amplify, a firm that provides professional development and curricula to school districts, which scored a total of over $70,500,000.",
      "The report states that in a now-scrubbed statement on its website, Amplify said its mission is to \"make education, and thereby the world, more equitable and accessible\" and to \"help teachers support their students in constructing, questioning, expanding, and strengthening knowledge of where they come from and who they are becoming.\"",
      "In response, a representative for Amplify told Fox News Digital that the group \"publishes textbooks and other instructional materials that help students learn reading, math and science\"\u00a0and that \"there is no place anywhere in Amplify\u2019s products, or in the training programs about how to use them, for ideologies or political agendas.\"",
      "The representative said \"our programs help students learn\u00a0how\u00a0to think, not\u00a0what\u00a0to think.\"",
      "The report highlights another consultant group, Adjusted Equity Solutions, which it says is associated with the Culturally Responsive School Leadership Institute, that claims to help schools challenge \"whiteness and hegemonic epistemologies in school,\" use \"equity audits to measure student inclusiveness, policy, and practice\" and serve as \"advocate and social activist for community-based causes in both the school and neighborhood community.\"",

      "\"Tinkering in the minds of other people's children is big business and countless K-12 schools across the country are active participants,\" Sanzi said. \"They pay big bucks to enter into contracts with ideologues and activists who, in turn, gain access, directly or indirectly, to a captive audience of young minds.\"",
      "Speaking with Fox News Digital via Zoom, Sanzi said that \"rather than this being a focus on sort of academic interventions, it's a lot of jargon that so far has not proven itself to be measurable.

      "\"At first, you're thinking lesson on empathy, like that's good,\" she said. \"Who wouldn't want their child to be empathetic? We want that. Until you realize that the lesson on empathy is going to be about something like a little girl in her bathroom at school, a staff member who's trans, so biologically male, but identifies as female, comes into the restroom with her. She naturally feels uncomfortable because that's a very natural feeling in a circumstance like that. But she's told that she needs to have \u2018empathy\u2019 for this grownup who identifies as female, right?

And so the question becomes, \u2018Are you getting rid of it? Or are you just rebranding it and shifting it somewhere else and taking it off your website?\u2019\"",
      "\"What many people don't understand is that the founders of these consultant companies and the people who run them and the practitioners are activists. They are ideologues,\" she went on. \"They have every right to believe that what they're transmitting is the right thing, but in a public-school setting that is required to maintain viewpoint diversity, these really have no place, not only because of the cost, not only cause it's public money, not only because they're not very transparent about what they're doing, but also because they are really trying to push an ideological agenda on other people's children.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Given the number of phishing scams we have all faced over the past decade, most of us have developed a basic skill to spot and avoid obvious phishing emails or SMS messages. Cybercriminals are aware of this, and they have evolved their tactics by shifting to more complex and convincing schemes designed to bypass skepticism and lure victims.",
      "Their goal remains the same: to trick you into handing over sensitive information, especially credit card data. One of the latest examples is the rise in subscription scam campaigns. Scammers are creating incredibly convincing websites selling everything from shoes and clothes to electronics, tricking people into signing up for monthly subscriptions and willingly providing their credit card information. Facebook is being used as the primary platform to promote these new and sophisticated scams.",

      "A woman shopping online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Bitdefender researchers have uncovered a massive and highly coordinated subscription scam campaign involving more than 200 active websites designed to look like real online stores. These sites, often promoted through Facebook ads, sell everything from clothes and electronics to beauty products, but the real goal is to trick users into signing up for recurring payments, often without realizing it.",
      "One of the most common lures is the \"mystery box\" scam, where you are promised a surprise package at a bargain price. These offers are made to look fun and harmless, but behind the scenes you are giving away personal and credit card information while unknowingly agreeing to hidden subscription terms, often written in tiny fine print.",
      "The scam doesn\u2019t stop there. Once you\u2019re convinced and reach the checkout page, scammers often layer in a second scam, like loyalty cards or VIP memberships that further lock you into payments. It\u2019s all designed to confuse you, overwhelm you with supposed perks and make the scam feel like a good deal.",
      "Researchers found that many of these websites share a single Cyprus address, possibly tied to offshore entities linked to the Paradise Papers. Despite being spread across different categories and brand names, the sites often use the same layouts, AI agents and payment structures, all pointing to a centralized fraud network.",
      "Scammers frequently rotate the brands they impersonate and have started moving beyond mystery boxes, now peddling low-quality products, counterfeit goods, fake investment schemes, dubious supplements and more. To avoid automatic detection, they employ several tactics. These include running multiple versions of an ad, with only one of which is actually malicious while the others display harmless product images, uploading ad images from platforms like Google Drive so they can be swapped out later and cropping visuals to alter recognizable patterns.",

Users are promised deep discounts or access to exclusive deals, but in reality they\u2019re just being locked into recurring payments.",
      "Many of the scam websites trace back to the same physical address in Cyprus, pointing to what appears to be a centralized operation. Researchers also found links to entities mentioned in the Paradise Papers, suggesting these fraudsters are hiding behind offshore infrastructure.",
      "And it\u2019s not just mystery boxes anymore. The same scam format is being used to sell low-quality goods, fake supplements and even bogus investment opportunities.

      "Even as scammers become more sophisticated, there are practical steps you can take right now to protect your personal and financial information from subscription fraud and other online threats. Here are ten proactive measures to help keep your data safe:",
      "1) Always read the fine print: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from subscription scams is to slow down and read the fine print, especially on checkout pages. Scammers often hide recurring payment terms in small or lightly colored text that\u2019s easy to miss. What seems like a one-time purchase could actually sign you up for a biweekly or monthly charge. Taking just a moment to scan for hidden terms before hitting \"Pay\" can help you avoid weeks of silent billing.",
      "2) Avoid mystery box or VIP-style deals:\u00a0These offers often prey on curiosity and the promise of surprise or luxury for a low fee. In reality, the \"mystery\" is the trap: you might receive nothing or a low-quality item while being unknowingly enrolled in a recurring subscription. Scammers use the illusion of exclusivity or urgency to pressure quick decisions.",
      "3) Don\u2019t trust ads blindly on social media:\u00a0Facebook, Instagram and other platforms are a hotbed for these scams, with criminals running paid ads that mimic well-known brands or influencers. These ads often link to professional-looking but fake storefronts. If you\u2019re interested in a deal you see online, don\u2019t click through immediately. Instead, look up the brand or offer in a separate tab and check if it exists outside social media.",
      "4) Investigate before you buy:\u00a0Before purchasing from any unfamiliar site, take a few quick steps to verify its legitimacy. Search the brand's name alongside words like \"scam\" or \"reviews\" to see what others have experienced. Look up the company's physical address and check if it actually exists using tools like Google Maps. Make sure the website uses HTTPS, review the site's contact information and cross-check reviews on trusted third-party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports.",
      "5) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Adding a strong antivirus program to your devices can provide an extra layer of defense against fraudulent websites and phishing attempts. Strong antivirus software warns you about suspicious links, blocks malicious ads and scans downloads for malware. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Scammers often rely on leaked or publicly available personal information to target victims with convincing subscription scams. Investing in a personal data removal service can help minimize your digital footprint by removing your information from data broker databases and reducing the chances of being targeted in future campaigns. Regularly monitoring and cleaning up your online presence makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your data for financial gain.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "7) Be cautious with payment methods: Use secure payment options like credit cards, which often offer better fraud protection than wire transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency.",
      "8) Limit personal information shared on social media: Scammers often gather details from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Review your privacy settings and only share necessary information.",
      "9) Use strong, unique passwords and enable multifactor authentication:\u00a0Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, especially those tied to your finances or shopping. Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible, as this adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10) Keep your devices and software updated:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and apps. Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that scammers exploit to gain access to your information or install malicious software.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While the rise of subscription scams and deceptive ads is concerning, it\u2019s especially troubling that platforms like Facebook continue to allow these fraudulent ads to run unchecked. Facebook has repeatedly failed to adequately vet or prevent these malicious campaigns from reaching vulnerable individuals. The platform\u2019s ad approval system should be more proactive in spotting and blocking ads promoting scams, particularly those that impersonate well-known brands or content creators.",

      "A chilling video circulating on social media has reignited old anxieties about robots turning against their creators.

Without warning, the robot loses control, thrashing its limbs, knocking over equipment and forcing the technicians to scramble out of harm's way. The chaos is palpable, and the images quickly drew comparisons to movies like \"The Terminator\" and \"I, Robot,\" with many viewers wondering if the age of rogue machines had finally arrived.",

Standing 5.9 feet tall and weighing 104 pounds, it's designed to walk, run and even perform dynamic movements like backflips and dancing. Its joints are powerful and capable of generating 365 pound-feet of torque, enough to lift heavy objects or, in the wrong circumstances, cause serious harm.",

      "Despite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm.",
      "The robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw.",

      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",

      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0\u200bCheck out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler has\u00a0revealed the existence of an open database that contains 184,162,718 million account credentials. These include email addresses, passwords, usernames and URLs for platforms such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat.",
      "The information also covers banking services, medical platforms and government accounts. Most shockingly, the entire dataset was left completely unsecured.

Once stolen, the data is often sold on dark web forums or used in targeted attacks.",
      "After reporting the breach, the hosting provider quickly removed access to the file. However, the owner of the database remains unknown. The provider did not disclose who uploaded it or whether the database was part of a legitimate archive that was accidentally published. Fowler could not determine whether this was the result of negligence or an operation with malicious intent.",
      "To verify the data, Fowler contacted some individuals listed in the records. Several confirmed that the information was accurate.

      "6 ways to protect yourself after a data breach",
      "1. Change your password on every platform: If your login credentials have been exposed, it\u2019s not enough to change the password on just one account. Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Our\u00a0top-rated password manager delivers powerful protection to help keep your accounts secure. It features\u00a0real-time data breach monitoring to alert you if your login details have been exposed, plus a built-in\u00a0data breach scanner\u00a0that checks your saved emails, passwords and credit card information against known leak databases. A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data.",
      "3. Watch for unusual account activity: After a breach, it\u2019s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions.",
      "4. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Keep your software and devices up to date: Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even apps\u00a0need to be updated regularly to patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you\u2019re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Security is not only the responsibility of companies and hosting providers. Users need to adopt better practices, including unique passwords, multifactor authentication and regular reviews of their digital footprint. The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent. In an era where artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and global connectivity are reshaping technology, it is unacceptable that plain text files containing financial and governmental credentials are still left sitting online.",

      "Learning to use the system took some trial and error. At first, the team tried mapping Smith's hand movements to the cursor, but it didn't work well. After more research, they discovered that signals related to his tongue were the most effective for cursor movement, and clenching his jaw worked best for clicking.\u00a0\"I am not actively thinking about my tongue, just like you don't think about your wrist when you move a mouse. I have done a lot of cursor movements in my life. I think my brain has switched over to subconscious control quickly so I just think about moving the cursor,\"\u00a0Smith said.",

      "Everyday life: Communication, play, and problem-solving",
      "The Neuralink implant has given Smith new ways to interact with his family and the world. He can now play games like Mario Kart with his children and communicate more quickly than before. The system includes a virtual keyboard and shortcuts for common actions, making tasks like copying, pasting and navigating web pages much easier.",
      "Smith also worked with Neuralink engineers to develop a \"parking spot\" feature for the cursor.\u00a0\"Sometimes you just wanna park the cursor and watch a video. When it is in the parking spot, I can watch a show or take a nap without worrying about the cursor,\" he explained.",

      "AI assistance: Keeping up with conversation",
      "To speed up communication even more, Smith uses Grok, Elon Musk's AI chatbot. Grok helps him write responses and even suggests witty replies. \"We have created a chat app that uses AI to listen to the conversation and gives me options to say in response. It uses Grok 3 and an AI clone of my old voice to generate options for me to say. It is not perfect, but it keeps me in the conversation and it comes up with some great ideas,\" Smith shared. One example? When a friend needed a gift idea for his girlfriend who loves horses, the AI suggested a bouquet of carrots.",

      "The human side: Family, faith and perspective",
      "Smith's journey has been shaped by more than just technology. He credits his wife, Tiffany, as his\u00a0\"best caregiver I could ever imagine,\" and recognizes the support of his kids, friends and family. Despite the challenges of ALS, Smith finds meaning and hope in his faith.\u00a0\"I have not always understood why God afflicted me with ALS but with time I am learning to trust his plan for me. I'm a better man because of ALS. I'm a better disciple of Jesus Christ because of ALS. I'm closer to my amazing wife, literally and figuratively, because of ALS,\" he said.",

As Smith puts it, \"Neuralink is giving me freedom, hope and faster communication. Overall, the whole Neuralink experience has been fantastic. It has improved my life so much. I'm so happy to be involved in something big that will help many people.\"\u00a0While ALS \"really sucks,\" as Smith says, his journey shows how innovation and determination can bring light to even the darkest rooms.

    "summary": "Here are five AI prompts you can use for freelance work, writing product descriptions, creating social media posts and writing emails to negotiate discounts.",
    "story": [
      "A majority of small businesses are using artificial intelligence and finding out it can save time and money.",
      "So, you want to start making money using AI but you\u2019re not trying to build Skynet or learn 15 coding languages first? Good, because neither am I. You don\u2019t need to become the next Sam Altman or have a Ph.D. in machine learning to turn artificial intelligence into real income. What you do need is curiosity, a dash of creativity, and the right prompts.",
      "\ud83d\udcb8 Enter to win $500 for you and $500 for your favorite person or charity in our\u00a0Pay It Forward Sweepstakes. Hurry, ends soon!",
      "I\u2019ve pulled together five powerful, practical prompts you can throw into ChatGPT (or your AI tool of choice) to help you start earning extra cash this week. These aren\u2019t pie-in-the-sky dreams or $10K-a-month YouTube ad schemes. They\u2019re doable, even if your calendar is already packed.",
      "5-MINUTE CLEANUP FOR YOUR PHONE AND COMPUTER",
      "Let\u2019s get to it.",
      "1. Fast-Track Your Freelance Life",
      "Prompt to use:\"Act as a freelance business coach. Suggest 3 services I can offer on Fiverr or Upwork using AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney or Canva. I have [insert skill: writing/design/admin/accounting/managerial] experience.\"",
      "Why this works:Freelance work is exploding right now. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are filled with small businesses and entrepreneurs who need help\u2014but don\u2019t have the budget to hire full-time staff. If you\u2019ve got any kind of professional background, you can use AI tools to turbocharge your services. Writing blog posts? ChatGPT can give you a draft. Creating logos or social media templates? Midjourney and Canva are your new best friends.",
      "You don\u2019t need a team. You don\u2019t need fancy software. You just need a good prompt and the confidence to say, \"Yes, I can do that.\" AI helps you scale what you already know how to do.",
      "A man is pictured with a smartphone and laptop computer on January 31, 2019.\u00a0 (Neil Godwin/Future via Getty Images)",
      "2. Make Product Descriptions Sexy Again",
      "Prompt to use:\"Rewrite this Etsy or Shopify product description to make it more compelling and SEO-friendly. Target audience: [insert group]. Here\u2019s the original: [paste description].\"",
      "Why this works:Let\u2019s face it\u2014most product descriptions online are a snooze. But good copy sells. Whether you\u2019re running your own shop or helping someone else with theirs, compelling product descriptions convert clicks into customers. Use ChatGPT to punch up the language, fine-tune for SEO, and speak directly to your ideal buyer.",
      "DON\u2019T SCAM YOURSELF WITH THE TRICKS HACKERS DON\u2019T WANT ME TO SHARE",
      "Remember: people don\u2019t just want to buy a weird mug. They want to buy what it says about them. That\u2019s where a smart rewrite can turn browsers into buyers.",
      "3. Social Posts That Sell",
      "Prompt to use:\"Create 5 attention-grabbing Instagram captions to promote this [product/service]. Keep the tone [fun, confident, expert] and include a strong call to action.\"",
      "Why this works:We live in a scroll-happy world. Your social captions need to grab attention in less than three seconds. But not everyone\u2019s a copywriter\u2014and not everyone has time to be. AI can help you crank out engaging content in the tone and style that fits your brand. Add a great photo, post consistently, and you\u2019re suddenly a one-person content agency without the overhead (or endless Zoom meetings).",
      "A photo taken on October 4, 2023 in Manta, near Turin, shows a smartphone and a laptop displaying the logos of the artificial intelligence OpenAI research company and ChatGPT chatbot. (MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "If you\u2019re managing social for clients or your own biz, this prompt is gold. Use it to build content calendars, write reels scripts, or even draft ad copy.",
      "4. Polite Emails That Save You Money",
      "Prompt to use:\"Write a short, polite email to ask for a lower rate or discount on [tool/service/platform]. Mention that I\u2019m a loyal customer comparing alternatives.\"",
      "Why this works:Negotiating discounts doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable but it absolutely works. Companies often have unpublished deals, especially for longtime users or small businesses. And customer service reps? They're human beings. A kind, well-written email might be all it takes to get a discount on that software you\u2019re using every month.",
      "20 TECH TRICKS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER, SAFER OR EASIER",
      "I\u2019ve personally saved hundreds of dollars just by sending quick, respectful emails like this. AI can help you strike the perfect tone confident but kind, assertive but not pushy.",
      "5. Your Passive Income Kit",
      "Prompt to use:\"Give me 3 high-demand, low-competition ideas for a short e-book or low-content book I can sell on Amazon. I have experience in [insert topic].\"",
      "Why this works:You have knowledge people want. Package it. Sell it. Repeat. Whether it\u2019s a short guide on starting a backyard garden or a workbook for productivity hacks, e-books and low-content books (like journals or planners) sell surprisingly well. And AI can help you brainstorm ideas, outline chapters, even draft content to polish up.",

      "Final Thought",
      "You don\u2019t need to master AI to start earning with it. You just need to start using it. These five prompts are a low-risk, high-potential way to get your feet wet. And if you need a hand turning these sparks into something bigger, I\u2019m here.",

      "Tech expert Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software.",
      "All modern Windows PCs come with Microsoft Defender built in. For the unaware, this tool is Windows\u2019 native antivirus.",
      "Over time, it has matured into a reliable security tool capable of blocking a wide range of threats. However, a tool called Defendnot can shut down Microsoft Defender completely, without exploiting a bug or using malware. It simply convinces Windows that another antivirus is already running.",
      "The implications are serious. This tool does not break into the system or use advanced code injection. It uses Windows features the way they were designed to be used. And that makes the problem harder to detect and harder to fix.",

      "Windows software on a PC (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The tool works by pretending to be an antivirus",
      "Windows is built to avoid running multiple antivirus products at once. When a third-party antivirus registers itself, Windows disables Microsoft Defender to prevent conflicts. Defendnot\u00a0exploits this system using an undocumented API that security software uses to communicate with the Windows Security Center.",
      "The tool registers a fake antivirus that appears legitimate to the system. It uses a dummy DLL and injects it into Task Manager, a trusted Windows process. By operating inside this signed process, Defendnot avoids signature checks and permission blocks. Once the fake antivirus is registered, Windows disables Microsoft Defender without warning or confirmation.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "No security alert is shown to the user. No visible changes are made to indicate that the system is unprotected. Unless someone checks manually, the machine remains open to attacks with no real-time protection running.",
      "The tool also includes options to set a custom antivirus name, enable logging and configure automatic startup. It achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs whenever the user logs in.",

It gained attention quickly and was removed after a copyright complaint from the vendor whose code had been reused. The developer took the project down and walked away from it.",
      "With Defendnot, the creator rebuilt the core features using original code. This version avoids copyright issues and uses a new method to achieve the same effect. It does not rely on another antivirus or third-party binaries. It was written from scratch to demonstrate how simple it is to manipulate Windows security from inside the system.",
      "Microsoft Defender currently flags the tool as a threat. It detects and quarantines it under the name Win32/Sabsik.FL.!ml. However, the fact that it works at all points to a weakness in how Windows handles antivirus registration and trust.",

      "While Defendnot is a research project, there\u2019s a chance that similar tools are already out there and could be used to compromise your PC. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe:",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Even with regular updates, Windows systems can be left exposed by tools like Defendnot that silently disable built-in defenses. A strong third-party antivirus with real-time protection and frequent updates provides essential backup security. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3. Avoid running unexpected commands: Never paste or run commands (like PowerShell scripts) you don\u2019t understand or that were copied from random websites. Attackers often trick users into unknowingly running malware this way.",
      "4. Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and all software applications. Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA on all your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Even with strong device security, your personal information may still be exposed online through data brokers and people-finder sites. These services collect and publish details like your name, address and phone number, making you an easier target for identity theft or phishing. Automated data removal services track down these sites and submit removal requests on your behalf, helping to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online anonymity. While they can't erase every trace of your information, they make it significantly harder for attackers to find and exploit your personal data, which saves you time and reduces unwanted spam in the process.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Defendnot points to a bigger issue with how Windows handles security. It takes a feature meant to prevent software conflicts and turns it into a way to completely disable protection. The system assumes any registered antivirus is legitimate, so if attackers can fake that, they get in without much resistance.",
      "We often think of security as blocking the bad and trusting the good. But this case shows what happens when that trust is misplaced. Defendnot doesn\u2019t sneak past Windows defenses. It walks right in using valid credentials. The solution isn\u2019t just more patches or stronger malware signatures. What we need is a smarter way for systems to tell what is actually safe.",

Whether it's summarizing complex ideas, designing a birthday card or even planning your apartment's layout, you can get impressive results with just a simple prompt.

      "If you haven't tried an LLM like ChatGPT before, here's the gist: They're advanced language processors that chat with you through text. No special commands or coding needed, just type what you want to know or do, and they respond. For example, asking \"Why is the conclave kept secret?\" will get you a detailed explanation in seconds.",
      "This simplicity is what makes LLMs so useful, but it also opens the door to risks. Instead of harmless questions, someone could ask for a detailed profile on a person, and the model might generate a surprisingly thorough report. While these tools have safeguards and often refuse certain requests, clever phrasing can sometimes bypass those limits.",

      "Every removal service out there has limitations on the number of data brokers it supports. It\u2019s not about a lack of effort; it\u2019s mostly because brokers are generally unwilling to cooperate, to put it mildly. But there\u2019s a way to address this issue without going back to manual opt-outs. The top names in the data removal industry now offer custom removals. In simple terms, this means you can ask them to remove your personal information from websites not currently covered by their standard plans.",
      "The catch is that you\u2019ll need to do the research yourself and point out which sites are exposing your data. It\u2019s not as convenient as having everything done automatically, but it\u2019s a relatively minor inconvenience for the sake of your online privacy.",

      "Kurt Knutsson reports World ID's iris scanning tech launches in six U.S. cities to verify identity, fight AI bots.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, known for creating ChatGPT, has launched World, a project that uses an eye scan to prove you are a real person online. The idea is to help people stand out from bots and AI by creating a digital ID with a quick scan from a device called the Orb.",
      "While Altman says this technology keeps humans central as AI advances, it also raises serious concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive biometric data, with critics and regulators questioning how this information will be used and protected.",

      "A woman looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How World ID works",
      "World ID relies on a device called the Orb, a spherical scanner that captures a person's iris pattern to generate a unique IrisCode. It stores the code on a blockchain-based platform, ensuring that users can verify their identity without revealing personal details.",
      "Once scanned, individuals receive their World ID, which can be used for authentication across various platforms where the World ID protocol has been integrated, including Reddit, Telegram and Shopify.",
      "Additionally, those who sign up are rewarded with WLD cryptocurrency as an incentive. They get the equivalent of $40 worth of tokens, which they can spend, exchange or share with other World ID holders.",

      "World ID has ambitious goals, but despite this, the project has faced significant backlash. Many people worry that storing eye scan data in a worldwide database could put their personal information at risk. Adding to the controversy, critics point out the irony of Sam Altman, whose company, OpenAI, contributes to the very AI challenges World ID aims to solve, being at the helm of this project.",
      "Governments in Spain, Argentina, Kenya and Hong Kong have either suspended or investigated the project due to concerns over excessive data collection. Furthermore, cybersecurity experts warn that once biometric data is linked to an identity system, it becomes irreversible, raising fears of potential surveillance.",

      "World ID helps prove that people online are real humans and not AI bots, something that is on the rise. In this AI-driven world, it can be an essential security measure to ensure the internet is a safer and more trustworthy place. Since the system is integrated with blockchain technology, it can definitely provide secure authentication across multiple platforms.

      "Cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright breaks down the dangers of deepfake video technology on 'Unfiltered.'",
      "Imagine your phone rings and the voice on the other end sounds just like your boss, a close friend, or even a government official. They urgently ask for sensitive information, except it's not really them. It's a deepfake, powered by AI, and you're the target of a sophisticated scam. These kinds of attacks are happening right now, and they're getting more convincing every day.",
      "That's the warning sounded by the 2025 AI Security Report, unveiled at the RSA Conference (RSAC), one of the world's biggest gatherings for cybersecurity experts, companies, and law enforcement. The report details how criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to impersonate people, automate scams, and attack security systems on a massive scale.",

      "Illustration of cybersecurity risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI tools are leaking sensitive data",
      "One of the biggest risks of using AI tools is what users accidentally share with them. A recent analysis by cybersecurity firm Check Point found that\u00a01 in every 80 AI prompts includes high-risk data, and about 1 in 13 contains sensitive information that could expose users or organizations to security or compliance risks.",
      "This data can include passwords, internal business plans, client information, or proprietary code. When shared with AI tools that are not secured, this information can be logged, intercepted, or even leaked later.",
      "Deepfake scams are now real-time and multilingual",
      "AI-powered impersonation is getting more advanced every month. Criminals can now fake voices and faces convincingly in real time. In early 2024, a British engineering firm lost 20 million pounds after scammers used live deepfake video to impersonate company executives during a Zoom call. The attackers looked and sounded like trusted leaders and convinced an employee to transfer funds.",
      "Real-time video manipulation tools are now being sold on criminal forums. These tools can swap faces and mimic speech during video calls in multiple languages, making it easier for attackers to run scams across borders.",
      "Illustration of a person video conferencing on their laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI is running phishing and scam operations at scale",
      "Social engineering has always been a part of cybercrime. Now, AI is automating it. Attackers no longer need to speak a victim\u2019s language, stay online constantly, or manually write convincing messages.",
      "Tools like GoMailPro use ChatGPT to create phishing and spam emails with perfect grammar and native-sounding tone. These messages are far more convincing than the sloppy scams of the past. GoMailPro can generate thousands of unique emails, each slightly different in language and urgency, which helps them slip past spam filters. It is actively marketed on underground forums for around $500 per month, making it widely accessible to bad actors.",
      "Another tool, the X137 Telegram Console, leverages Gemini AI to monitor and respond to chat messages automatically. It can impersonate customer support agents or known contacts, carrying out real-time conversations with multiple targets at once. The replies are uncensored, fast, and customized based on the victim\u2019s responses, giving the illusion of a human behind the screen.",
      "AI is also powering large-scale\u00a0sextortion scams. These are emails that falsely claim to have compromising videos or photos and demand payment to prevent them from being shared. Instead of using the same message repeatedly, scammers now rely on AI to rewrite the threat in dozens of ways. For example, a basic line like \"Time is running out\" might be reworded as \"The hourglass is nearly empty for you,\" making the message feel more personal and urgent while also avoiding detection.",
      "By removing the need for language fluency and manual effort, these AI tools allow attackers to scale their phishing operations dramatically. Even inexperienced scammers can now run large, personalized campaigns with almost no effort.",
      "Stolen AI accounts are sold on the dark web",
      "With AI tools becoming more popular, criminals are now targeting the accounts that use them. Hackers are stealing ChatGPT logins, OpenAI API keys, and other platform credentials to bypass usage limits and hide their identity. These accounts are often stolen through malware, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks. The stolen credentials are then sold in bulk on Telegram channels and underground forums. Some attackers are even using tools that can bypass multi-factor authentication and session-based security protections. These stolen accounts allow criminals to access powerful AI tools and use them for phishing, malware generation, and scam automation.",

      "Criminals are finding ways to bypass the safety rules built into AI models. On the dark web, attackers share techniques for jailbreaking AI so it will respond to requests that would normally be blocked. Common methods include:",
      "Telling the AI to pretend it is a fictional character that has no rules or limitationsPhrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenariosAsking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",

      "Phrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenarios",
      "Asking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",
      "Some AI models can even be tricked into jailbreaking themselves. Attackers prompt the model to create input that causes it to override its own restrictions. This shows how AI systems can be manipulated in unexpected and dangerous ways.",
      "AI-generated malware is entering the mainstream",
      "AI is now being used to build malware, phishing kits, ransomware scripts, and more. Recently, a group called\u00a0FunkSac was identified as the leading ransomware gang using AI. Its leader admitted that at least 20% of their attacks are powered by AI. FunkSec has also used AI to help launch attacks that flood websites or services with fake traffic, making them crash or go offline. These are known as denial-of-service attacks. The group even created its own AI-powered chatbot to promote its activities and communicate with victims on its public website..",
      "Some cybercriminals are even using AI to help with marketing and data analysis after an attack. One tool called\u00a0Rhadamanthys Stealer 0.7 claimed to use AI for \"text recognition\" to sound more advanced, but researchers later found it was using older technology instead. This shows how attackers use AI buzzwords to make their tools seem more advanced or trustworthy to buyers.",
      "Other tools are more advanced. One example is DarkGPT, a chatbot built specifically to sort through huge databases of stolen information. After a successful attack, scammers often end up with logs full of usernames, passwords, and other private details. Instead of sifting through this data manually, they use AI to quickly find valuable accounts they can break into, sell, or use for more targeted attacks like ransomware.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "Poisoned AI models are spreading misinformation",
      "Sometimes, attackers do not need to hack an AI system. Instead, they trick it by feeding it false or misleading information. This tactic is called AI poisoning, and it can cause the AI to give biased, harmful, or completely inaccurate answers. There are two main ways this happens:",
      "Training poisoning: Attackers sneak false or harmful data into the model during developmentRetrieval poisoning: Misleading content online gets planted, which the AI later picks up when generating answers",

      "A large-scale example came from a Russian propaganda group called Pravda, which published more than 3.6 million fake articles online. These articles were designed to trick AI chatbots into repeating their messages. In tests, researchers found that major AI systems echoed these false claims about 33% of the time.",

      "How to protect yourself from AI-driven cyber threats",
      "AI-powered cybercrime blends realism, speed, and scale. These scams are not just harder to detect. They are also easier to launch. Here\u2019s how to stay protected:",
      "1) Avoid entering sensitive data into public AI tools:\u00a0Never share passwords, personal details, or confidential business information in any AI chat, even if it seems private. These inputs can sometimes be logged or misused.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software: AI-generated phishing emails and malware can slip past outdated security tools. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "3) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts, including AI platforms. It makes it much harder for attackers to break in using stolen passwords.",
      "4) Be extra cautious with unexpected video calls or voice messages: If something feels off, even if the person seems familiar, verify before taking action. Deepfake audio and video can sound and look very real.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: With AI-powered scams and deepfake attacks on the rise, criminals are increasingly relying on publicly available personal information to craft convincing impersonations or target victims with personalized phishing. By using a reputable personal data removal service, you can reduce your digital footprint on data broker sites and public databases. This makes it much harder for scammers to gather the details they need to convincingly mimic your identity or launch targeted AI-driven attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection: If your data is leaked through a scam, early detection is key. Identity protection services can monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "7) Regularly monitor your financial accounts: AI-generated phishing, malware, and account takeover attacks are now more sophisticated and widespread than ever, as highlighted in the 2025 AI Security Report. By frequently reviewing your bank and credit card statements for suspicious activity, you can catch unauthorized transactions early, often before major damage is done. Quick detection is crucial, especially since stolen credentials and financial information are now being traded and exploited at scale by cybercriminals using AI.",
      "8) Use a secure password manager: Stolen AI accounts and credential stuffing attacks are a growing threat, with hackers using automated tools to break into accounts and sell access on the dark web. A secure\u00a0password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, making it far more difficult for attackers to compromise your logins, even if some of your information is leaked or targeted by AI-driven attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "9) Keep your software updated: AI-generated malware and advanced phishing kits are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. To stay ahead of these evolving threats, ensure all your devices, browsers, and applications are updated with the latest security patches.\u00a0Regular updates close security gaps that AI-powered malware and cybercriminals are actively seeking to exploit.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals are now using AI to power some of the most convincing and scalable attacks we\u2019ve ever seen. From deepfake video calls and AI-generated phishing emails to stolen AI accounts and malware written by chatbots, these scams are becoming harder to detect and easier to launch. Attackers are even poisoning AI models with false information and creating fake tools that look legitimate but are designed to do harm. To stay safe, it\u2019s more important than ever to use strong antivirus protection, enable multi-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive data with AI tools you do not fully trust.",

That is exactly the kind of thinking that inspired the Acticycle. This four-wheeled electric vehicle is shaking up city transportation by blending the best parts of both worlds. With the Acticycle, you get the comfort, weather protection, and storage you would expect from a car, but with the agility, efficiency, and low cost of a bike.",

      "Let's start with the numbers, since they really set the\u00a0Acticycle apart. The vehicle measures about 93 inches long, 36 inches wide, and 60 inches tall, making it compact enough for bike lanes and city streets, but roomy enough for two adults or one adult and two small children. It weighs just 220 pounds, about one-fifth the weight of a typical electric car, and can carry up to 660 pounds of passengers and cargo.",
      "The Acticycle rides on four 20-inch reinforced wheels with puncture-resistant tires, and it uses hydraulic disc brakes for reliable stopping power. Depending on the model, you can choose from a 250-watt, 750-watt, or dual 2000-watt motor setup. Top speeds range from 16 miles per hour with the 250-watt motor to 28 miles per hour with the more powerful versions. The removable lithium-ion batteries provide a range of up to 62 miles per charge, and you can double that by adding a second battery. The Acticycle also features a total of 6 cubic feet of cargo space, divided between a secure hard trunk and a flexible soft compartment, so you can haul groceries, gear, or whatever your day demands.",

The two ergonomic seats are designed to make even long rides enjoyable, so you and a friend can chat and relax on your way to work or out on the town. The seating is plush and supportive, which means you can say goodbye to the aches and pains that come with traditional cycling.",

With up to 62 miles of range per battery, most daily commutes are easily covered, and you can add a second battery for longer trips. The powerful motor delivers up to 133 pound-feet of torque, which means you can climb hills and accelerate into traffic without breaking a sweat. This kind of performance is usually reserved for much heavier and more expensive electric vehicles, but the Acticycle brings it to a whole new category.",

With about 6 cubic feet of storage, split between a lockable hard trunk and a roomy soft compartment, you can carry everything from groceries and work supplies to picnic gear and gym bags. The storage is designed to keep your cargo secure and balanced, so you never have to worry about tipping or losing control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Eco-friendly and budget-smart",
      "The Acticycle is not just good for your commute, it is good for the planet and your wallet. Its lightweight frame and efficient battery system mean it uses far less energy than a car, and its maintenance needs are similar to a cargo bike rather than a car. You will save money on fuel, parking, insurance, and repairs, all while reducing your environmental impact. It is a win-win for anyone looking to make smarter choices in the city.",

      "When it comes to price, the Acticycle is designed to be a smart investment for urban commuters who want all the benefits of a car and a bike, but without the hefty price tag. While official U.S. pricing has not been widely announced yet, early European versions start at around $8,000 to $10,000, depending on the motor and battery configuration you choose. This puts it in a unique spot, since it is much less expensive than most electric cars, but does cost more than a high-end electric bike or cargo bike.",

      "\"It\u2019s not an Israeli problem and not a Jewish problem, it's an American problem. These people who incite, who call for violence, who use antisemitic rhetoric, at the end of the day, they are shaking the pillars of American democracy,\" Saar told Fox News Digital.",
      "The diplomat also spoke about the phrase \"globalize the Intifada,\" a slogan that has become more common at anti-Israel demonstrations. Saar says the phrase refers to those seeking to export violence beyond the Middle East to places like America, making the D.C. shooting much more than a local tragedy.",

While Saar acknowledged that America\u2019s First Amendment \"is sacred,\" he warned that there is a difference between expressing one\u2019s viewpoint and inciting violence.",
      "Even as Jews and Israelis feel unsafe, Saar does not think the answer is to hide who they are, but rather to unite and \"resist by all legal means\" those who use lies and hateful rhetoric to incite violence.",

      "In last year\u2019s election, votes for the EFF slumped to under 10%, and both of Malema\u2019s sidekicks, party co-founders and men he described as \"brothers,\" left him and joined a competing party.",

      "To Malema, critics say, the chant may be more than just song lyrics. At least twice he told reporters here, \"We have not called for the killing of White people \u2013 at least for now.\" On another occasion, he demanded, \"We will cut the throat of Whiteness.\"",

However, his popularity as a political leader has faded somewhat.\"",
      "Malema openly supports the terror group Hamas, telling a rally in 2023, shortly after the October 7 attack on Israel, \"when you are oppressed, you only have one option, shoot to kill. There is nothing wrong with what Hamas is doing. The EFF is going to arm Hamas.\" He also shouted he intended to shut down the Israeli Embassy in South Africa. \"We are going to remove this embassy,\" he yelled to loud cheers.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The beginning of June marks the start of the traditional monthlong ruling season at the Supreme Court, when the justices hand down decisions in their biggest and most contentious cases.",
      "But this year is different.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s second term has disrupted the court calendar, with the nine justices now spending as much time, if not more, juggling consequential emergency cases that need to be handled quickly as they do on the regular docket of cases that have gotten months of attention and deliberation.",
      "\u201cIt underscores the degree to which Donald Trump and the Trump administration are sucking all of the oxygen out of the room,\u201d said Leah Litman, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and the author of a new book about the court, \u201cLawless.\u201d",
      "This can affect the public\u2019s knowledge and understanding of what the court is doing in part because media organizations are used to devoting additional resources to coverage during June that are not necessarily available at other times of the year, she added.",
      "It also changes the normal rhythms of the court\u2019s operations. The court announces ahead of time when rulings in argued cases are expected, and they are always issued at 10 a.m. But emergency decisions can drop at any time of day, with no advance notice. One recent decision was released in the early hours of a Saturday morning.",
      "Nearly all the emergency cases are related to the administration\u2019s aggressive interpretations of federal law in executive orders that have regularly been blocked by federal judges.",
      "As June begins, the Supreme Court has 33 cases to decide out of 62 on the so-called merits docket. Those are the cases in which the justices heard arguments in the current nine-month term, which started in October, and would be expected to decide by issuing lengthy written decisions. The next scheduled ruling day is Thursday.",
      "In the meantime, the court since January has already issued rulings of some description in 11 Trump-related emergency cases via what has been dubbed the \u201cshadow docket,\u201d and it has several others pending. These are cases in which the justices do not generally hear oral arguments, and they are often decided by brief court orders without the lengthy, detailed reasoning associated with major Supreme Court decisions.",
      "But the shadow docket decisions can be just as practically important as the cases decided on the merits docket, sparking concerns about transparency and process.",
      "This term's big Supreme Court decisions",
      "Via the shadow docket, the court has already allowed Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people in the military to go into effect, given a green light to the firing of independent agency members, and approved the administration\u2019s removal of legal protections for thousands of Venezuelan immigrants.",
      "The justices have also put the brakes on an attempt by the administration to use a wartime law to deport Venezuelans it claims are gang members and ordered Trump to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly sent to El Salvador.",
      "On Friday, the court allowed the Trump administration to revoke legal protections for more than 500,000 immigrants.",
      "In the meantime, the docket of merits cases has a relatively small number of headline-grabbing cases compared with previous years.",
      "Of those cases yet to be decided, the biggest is a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans gender transition care for minors. The court is also set to rule on a conservative religious objection to LGBTQ-themed books in a Maryland county\u2019s schools and an effort by Texas to restrict access to pornographic websites.",
      "By comparison, last June, the court\u2019s rulings included one granting Trump broad immunity from prosecution for events that took place during his first term as president, a trio of rulings that weakened federal agency power, a decision upholding a law that bars domestic abusers from possessing guns, and another rejecting a challenge to the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "In the summer of 2023, the court within a matter of days ended affirmative action in college admissions and killed President Joe Biden\u2019s student loan debt relief plan.",
      "And the previous summer, the court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision.",
      "How the shadow docket is changing the court",
      "\u201cThe emergency docket seems to have almost swallowed the court\u2019s merits docket over the past month or so,\u201d said Greg Garre, a Washington lawyer who regularly argues cases at the court. One case he argued, concerning Oklahoma\u2019s attempt to launch the first religious public charter school, was poised to be one of the biggest of the term. But it ended up fizzling when the court deadlocked 4-4.",
      "In fact, some cases that arise as emergency applications have ended up being converted into merits cases, creating what some view as a \u201crocket docket\u201d \u2014 that is, major cases zooming immediately to the high court instead of taking months or years to navigate the normal appeals process.",
      "\u201cIn a few years, we may no longer be able to say that the emergency docket is an \u2018irregular\u2019 procedure. It might become the normal procedure for all high-stakes litigation,\u201d said William Baude, a University of Chicago Law School professor who coined the \u201cshadow docket\u201d phrase.",
      "One high-profile example was the court\u2019s January decision upholding a law that was intended to ban TikTok if its Chinese owner did not immediately sell it. The Supreme Court resolved the entire case within weeks after it reached the court via an emergency appeal.",
      "The court also elected to hear oral arguments in a trio of shadow docket cases concerning nationwide injunctions issued by judges that blocked Trump\u2019s plan to end birthright citizenship, in a further blurring of the regular merits docket and the fast-moving shadow docket.",
      "Some Supreme Court watchers have speculated that the justices deliberately kept their merits docket relatively light this term, knowing that there was the possibility of election-related cases in the fall and a potential wave of Trump-related cases if he won the election, based on what happened in his first term.",
      "\u201cI definitely feel like the court is reserving space in its schedule for emergency docket cases involving Trump administration initiatives,\u201d said John Elwood, another lawyer who argues cases at the court."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0on Monday declined to hear two major gun cases challenging a Maryland law that bans assault-style weapons, including the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle that has been used in high-profile mass shootings, and a Rhode Island restriction on large-capacity magazines.",
      "As a result, the two laws remain in effect. Litigation over similar bans across the country is ongoing, and the issue is likely to return to the justices.",
      "The court has a 6-3 conservative majority that has expanded gun rights but has also shown a reluctance in recent months to take up a new case on the scope of the right to bear arms under the Constitution's Second Amendment.",
      "It seems likely the court will take up the assault weapons issue soon, with three conservative justices saying they voted to take it up and another, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, saying he would like the justices to hear a case on the issue in the next couple of years.",
      "Four votes are needed for the court to hear a case.",
      "Kavanaugh wrote in a separate statement that the ruling that upheld the Maryland ban is \"questionable\" under the court's recent precedents, adding that \"in my view, this court should and presumably will address the AR-15 issue soon.\"",
      "He noted that millions of Americans own AR-15s, making Maryland\u2019s ban \u201csomething of an outlier.\u201d",
      "The court in a major 2022 ruling expanded gun rights by finding for the first time that the right to bear arms extends outside the home.",
      "That has led to a wave of both new restrictions being imposed in some states and court rulings that have struck down some long-standing gun laws. Both these developments have led to a flurry of appeals at the court asking the justices to clarify the scope of the 2022 ruling.",
      "Justice Clarence Thomas, who along with Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch wanted to hear the Maryland case, wrote a dissenting opinion saying that the Maryland law was most likely not consistent with the 2022 ruling.",
      "\"It is difficult to see how Maryland's categorical prohibition on AR-15s passes muster under this framework,\" he wrote.",
      "The Maryland law bans what the state calls \u201cassault weapons\u201d akin to weapons of war like the M16 rifle as well as the AR-15. The  measure became law in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting, in which 20 children and six adults were killed the previous year.",
      "That law was upheld by the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals before the Supreme Court's 2022. A new set of plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit, and the Supreme Court ordered the appeals court to take a second look at the issue. It reached the same conclusion in an August 2024 ruling.",
      "\"The assault weapons at issue fall outside the ambit of protection offered by the Second Amendment because, in essence, they are military-style weapons designed for sustained combat operations that are ill-suited and disproportionate to the need for self-defense,\" the court concluded.",
      "The Rhode Island law, enacted just before the Supreme Court issued the 2022 ruling, prevents people from possessing magazines that contain more than 10 rounds.",
      "Lower courts, including the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, upheld the ban, which was challenged by four gun owners and a firearms store called Big Bear Hunting and Fishing Supply.",
      "The Supreme Court last July sidestepped multiple gun-related disputes soon after it issued a ruling that upheld a federal law that prohibits people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms.",
      "In a case that did not directly address the right to bear arms, the court on March 26\u00a0upheld a Biden administration bid to regulate \u201cghost gun\u201d kits that can be easily assembled to make firearms."

    "story": [
      "Summer looks a little different this year for some Americans who say they are dialing back their leisure activities and shopping sprees due to tariffs.",
      "Since taking office for his second term, President Donald Trump has ordered a number of sweeping tariffs, including a blanket 10% tariff on all imports, that have driven up costs on various products. He has also threatened additional tariffs, which has resulted in volatility in the stock market and continued concern from consumers about their personal costs.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are making high prices even more unreasonably high, to the point where \u2026 what you\u2019re charging is not even close to what this is worth,\u201d said Raina Becker, 49, a recently laid-off writer who now works as a freelance copy editor in upstate New York. Becker said she was hoping to invest in a new summer wardrobe. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t in good faith do it, because I can\u2019t afford to spend my money like this.\u201d",
      "The apparel industry has taken an especially hard hit from Trump\u2019s tariff program because a vast majority of clothing, shoes and accessories are manufactured in places like China, Vietnam and India before being shipped to the U.S.",
      "Like Becker, Mei Wu, 31, who lives in Los Angeles, realized she can\u2019t splurge on shopping this year. She had her eye on a $170 dress from the Australian brand VRG GRL as an outfit for her June birthday party. But when\u00a0she saw that another\u00a0$277.95 would be tacked on to the price because of tariffs, she decided not to purchase it.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is, I do think that we deserve to be able to buy where we want to buy without getting punished for it. How we spend our money is totally up to us, and at the end of the day we work hard for what we bring to the door,\u201d said Wu, a content creator who described her shopping dilemma as a \u201cfirst world problem,\u201d but one that is frustrating all the same.",
      "A recent consumer pulse report from the accounting firm KPMG, which surveyed 1,516 U.S. consumers, found that \u201cin response to tariffs, 50% are cutting back on purchases, and 49% are actively seeking deals and discounts.\u201d When asked specifically about summer plans, many said they are still choosing to travel \u2014 but have otherwise cracked down on personal expenses.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a more selective and cost-conscious summer travel season,\u201d Duleep Rodrigo, KPMG\u2019s consumer and retail leader, said in a statement in the report. \u201cVacations are still in the budget \u2014 but nearly everything else is on the chopping block.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff policies are facing a number of legal challenges in court, with some judges calling them unlawful. However, a federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily paused rulings by a panel of judges that, just hours earlier, halted several of the president\u2019s tariffs on international trading partners.",
      "As Americans wait for news of whether tariffs will continue to be imposed, they are still hoping to have fun during summer.",
      "Patrice LaBelle Lester, 29, is spending the next few months planning her October vow renewal celebration. But she\u2019s being more frugal with her budget.",
      "For example, she said she found a way to order faux flowers \u2014 which were being shipped from China \u2014 in bulk without paying the surcharge caused by tariffs. Originally, the price was $300. With tariffs, they skyrocketed to about $1,700.",
      "So the content creator found a different vendor who would be willing to cover the cost of the tariffs so Lester could stay within her original budget. But she said she was warned that because the flowers would have to be shipped by cargo freighter, rather than by plane, there would be a delay in receiving them. Lester said she\u2019s also hoping to grow her family, which means she wants to purchase a new car over the summer.",
      "\u201cI know Trump said he was only giving, I guess, a tax break to those that buy an American-made car, but it\u2019s hard to kind of support that in this political climate,\u201d said Lester, who lives in San Antonio, Texas. \u201cSo it\u2019s impacting me in that way, because that is a purchase I would like to make\u00a0in the next few months.\u201d",
      "For Becker, there has been one unexpected perk of reeling in her spending: getting to do more activities that bring people together.",
      "\u201cA number of people are talking about, again, myself included, hoarding craft supplies for our various hobbies,\u201d she said, reflecting on how changes in her spending have also realigned her values. \u201cThe silver lining in all this is that it can, if done correctly, build community.\u201d"

      "\"We haven\u2019t eaten bread for a long time,\" she told NBC News. \"And when he went to get it, they shot at him before he reached the aid point.\"",
      "NBC News journalists at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said they saw at least 50 of the wounded enter the facility.",
      "The Palestine Red Crescent said it had transported \u201c23 fatalities and 23 injured individuals\u201d from the aid distribution point in Rafah.",
      "The Israeli military on Sunday denied allegations that it fired on civilians at the aid distribution site based on what it called an initial inquiry.",
      "Aid distribution chaos",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which began distributing aid in the enclave last week as part of a new U.S.- and Israel-backed plan, said that it delivered 16 trucks of food \u201cwithout incident,\u201d and denied reports of \u201cdeaths, mass injuries and chaos\u201d at its distribution sites.",
      "GHF later shared hours of CCTV video appearing to show crowds of Palestinians peacefully collecting aid from one of its distribution centers. It was not immediately clear when and where the video was taken.",
      "\u201cAs noted in our daily report earlier, aid was distributed without incident,\u201d the organization said in a statement accompanying the video. \u201cReports of injuries and fatalities are completely false and fabricated. Please do not be duped by them.\u201d",
      "GHF was tasked with distributing aid in Gaza after Israel earlier this month lifted an almost three-month blockade barring the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies following warnings of rising starvation in the enclave.",
      "But its first week in operation has been marred by controversy and chaos.",
      "Last week, thousands of hungry Palestinians flooded one of its distribution centers and Israeli soldiers fired live rounds into the air to disperse crowds.",
      "GHF rejected statements by Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run government media office that three Palestinians were killed, 46 others injured and seven people were missing after the incident. The foundation said that no one was killed while trying to access its distribution site.",
      "GHF\u2019s former executive director, Jake Wood, also quit the organization ahead of its operations in Gaza, saying it was impossible to implement the plan while also adhering to the \u201chumanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence,\u201d according to a statement published by Reuters.",
      "The United Nations, which has refused to participate in the plan, has condemned the GHF initiative as a \u201cdistraction\u201d that undermines a long-standing humanitarian framework in Gaza. The U.N. says the effort poses a threat to the independence of aid operations, while simultaneously displacing Palestinians en masse to Gaza\u2019s south.",
      "Israel has maintained that a new aid distribution system was necessary, alleging that Hamas was diverting supplies. The United Nations and other humanitarian groups have said they have not seen evidence that the group was siphoning off aid meant to go to civilians.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 54,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, which has been run by Hamas since 2007."

      "The report found a year-over-year increase in incidents targeting transgender and gender-nonconforming people, state and local governments, and educators and librarians. It also found a decrease in incidents targeting drag performers and pride symbols.",
      "\u201cThis really goes toward showing these kinds of shifting tides in hate and what extremists like to focus on at the moment,\u201d Sarah Moore, an analyst of anti-LGBTQ extremism at GLAAD, told NBC News. \u201cThey really are kind of beholden to the new cycle of the day.\u201d",
      "This is the third year GLAAD has published an annual report based on its Anti-LGBTQ Extremism Reporting Tracker. The 932 incidents tracked in this latest report occurred between May 1, 2024, and May 1, 2025. This is a 20% drop from last year\u2019s 1,173 incidents and an 80% increase from the 521 incidents tracked in its inaugural report in 2023.",
      "GLAAD defines anti-LGBTQ incidents as both criminal and noncriminal \u201cacts of harassment, threats, vandalism, and assault motivated by anti-LGBTQ hate and extremism.\u201d Incidents are tracked through self-reports, media reports, social media posts and data sharing from partner organizations and law enforcement and then validated by a team at GLAAD.",
      "Moore cautions that the incidents tracked in the report are \u201cjust a drop in the bucket in terms of what is actually happening when it comes to anti-LGBTQ hate.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is more of a snapshot of what the lived experience of LGBTQ people is, as opposed to being an exact accurate representation of every incident of hate in the U.S.,\u201d she said.",
      "One of the most surprising findings from this year\u2019s report, Moore said, was the sharp decrease in incidents targeting drag performers, which dropped to 83 tracked incidents from 185 the year prior.",
      "\u201cThis really goes to show the resilience of the drag community, and that we\u2019ve seen them take all of these amazing steps toward protecting their own personal safety, protecting the safety of their audiences and working with community security organizations,\u201d she said.",
      "Coinciding with this decrease in anti-drag incidents is an increase in incidents targeting local and state governments and educators and librarians.",
      "\u201cWe saw a number of our incidents, actually, going after city council officials, going after political candidates who are either LGBTQ or who support the community, going after legislators at the state level who are trying to protect or enshrine LGBTQ rights and going after educators and librarians that are offering safe spaces for LGBTQ youth in their classrooms and in their libraries as well,\u201d Moore said.",
      "Anti-LGBTQ incidents take place more frequently in June, according to the past two years of reporting by GLAAD\u2019s Anti-LGBTQ Extremism Reporting Tracker.",
      "\u201cThat is most likely attributed to the fact that June is Pride Month, and that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to have the biggest number of LGBTQ events and the most visible events,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThis June, for example, D.C. is holding WorldPride, which is going to be a really massive event and really massive showing of support for the LGBTQ community in the U.S. and globally.\u201d",
      "When asked if GLAAD has safety tips for those planning to attend Pride Month events this year, Moore noted that one of the hallmarks of the LGBTQ community is its \u201cresilience and strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis hate, unfortunately, is not new to us. We have been dealing with persecution, with oppression, with these acts of hate against our community for centuries,\u201d she said, adding that the first Pride marches were protests held on the first anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall uprising.",
      "\u201cSo I think just really carrying on those legacies of pride as a form of protest, pride as a form of resistance, pride as a refusal to allow others to define us and to legislate our bodies and tell us that we have to be kept in private spaces and not display our true authentic selves to the rest of the world.\u201d"

      "As a result, the two laws remain in effect. Litigation over similar bans across the country is ongoing, and the issue is likely to return to the justices.",

      "That law was upheld by the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals before the Supreme Court's 2022.

      "Middle-aged and older participants in a large, long-term study were less likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other types of dementia if they followed a diet filled with green, leafy vegetables, olive oil, whole grains and lots of berries, according to a report presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition.",
      "Researchers from University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa and the University of Southern California discovered that adhering to the MIND diet, which combines the Mediterranean diet with the blood-pressure-lowering DASH diet, results in a stronger and more consistent reduction in dementia risk than what is seen with other healthy diets.",
      "The new findings suggest it\u2019s never too late to switch to a healthy diet, said the study\u2019s lead author, Song-Yi Park, an associate professor at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa. \u201cIt shows that sticking to a healthy diet, as well as improving the health of the person\u2019s diet over time, is very important for older adults who want to prevent dementia.\u201d",
      "While all the Mediterranean-related diets appear to be good for the brain, the MIND dietary pattern was specifically designed for brain health.",
      "\u201cOne important difference is that MIND includes berries, which have been linked to brain health,\u201d Park said.",
      "The MIND diet, or Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, scores individual foods based on how protective they are and how much is eaten. Berries \u2014 especially strawberries and blueberries \u2014 for example, get a score of 1 if two or more servings are consumed per week. The score drops to 0.5 if just one serving per week is consumed and a score of 0 if none are.",
      "A person\u2019s individual diet gets an overall rating by adding up the scores for individual foods. The higher the overall score, the better it\u2019s for the person\u2019s brain.",
      "Park and her colleagues turned to data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults who had provided information about what they ate as part of a research project known as The Multiethnic Cohort to get a closer look at how diet influenced the risk of developing dementia.",
      "The Multiethnic Cohort was started in the early 1990s through a joint effort of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. The men and women enrolled in the study came from five ethnic/racial populations: Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, Black Americans, Latinos and whites.",
      "At the outset, the 215,000 participants were ages 45 to 75. When data for the new study was analyzed, more than 21,000 participants had developed Alzheimer\u2019s or a related dementia.",
      "At the beginning of the study, people who scored higher for adherence to MIND had a 9% lower risk of developing dementia.",
      "The amount of reduction varied among the racial groups in the new analysis. Greater risk reduction, 13%, was seen in participants who identified as Black, Latino or white.",
      "Participants who improved their adherence to MIND over the 10-year period had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared with those whose adherence declined, and that trend was seen across all age and racial groups.",
      "How to follow the MIND diet",
      "Some suggestions for reaching the optimal score for the MIND diet, according to a 2015 study:",
      "Leafy green vegetables, such as kale, spinach, broccoli, bok choy and mustard: six or more servings per weekOther vegetables: one serving per day Nuts, such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios: five or more servings per weekCheese: less than one per weekWhole grains: three or more per dayFish (not fried): one or more servings per weekRed meat: less than one serving per weekFast fried foods: less than one per weekPastries and sweets: less than five servings per week",
      "Leafy green vegetables, such as kale, spinach, broccoli, bok choy and mustard: six or more servings per week",
      "Other vegetables: one serving per day",
      "Nuts, such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios: five or more servings per week",
      "Cheese: less than one per week",
      "Whole grains: three or more per day",
      "Fish (not fried): one or more servings per week",
      "Red meat: less than one serving per week",
      "Fast fried foods: less than one per week",
      "Pastries and sweets: less than five servings per week",
      "Park cautioned that like all observational studies, the new research reports an association and doesn\u2019t prove that the diet prevents dementia.",
      "It is a high-quality study, Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School, said in an email.",
      "\u201cIt adds to the evidence that a Mediterranean-type diet has important benefits for reducing the risk of dementia,\u201d said Willett, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cThe differences between groups defined by race/ethnicity may well be due to random variation, so at this time it\u2019s reasonable to assume that this healthy dietary pattern has benefits for all groups.\"",
      "When it comes to leafy green vegetables, it\u2019s probably best to consume a variety rather than a single type, Willett said.",
      "\u201cIn particular, spinach is good in many ways, but has high oxalate content and high intake of spinach can cause kidney stones,\u201d he said.",
      "In general, the MIND diet is in line with the principles of the two diets it\u2019s built from, said Dr. Yian Gu, an associate professor of neurological sciences at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. \u201cEach of those diets has unique characteristics,\u201d she said.",
      "The Mediterranean diet emphasizes multiple daily servings of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains, legumes, olive oil, seafood, and nuts and seeds, such as chia, flax, pumpkin and sesame.",
      "DASH, or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, is meant to prevent hypertension, so it emphasizes low salt, which isn\u2019t a major component in the Mediterranean diet.",
      "The MIND diet is easy to follow, Gu said, encouraging people to pick the green, leafy vegetables they prefer. What\u2019s important is to increase the diversity of vegetables.",
      "Another benefit of Mediterranean-type diets: They are helpful with other types of chronic disease, including heart disease and cancer, she said."

      "Summer looks a little different this year for some Americans who say they are dialing back their leisure activities and shopping sprees due to tariffs.",
      "Since taking office for his second term, President Donald Trump has ordered a number of sweeping tariffs, including a blanket 10% tariff on all imports, that have driven up costs on various products. He has also threatened additional tariffs, which has resulted in volatility in the stock market and continued concern from consumers about their personal costs.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are making high prices even more unreasonably high, to the point where \u2026 what you\u2019re charging is not even close to what this is worth,\u201d said Raina Becker, 49, a recently laid-off writer who now works as a freelance copy editor in upstate New York. Becker said she was hoping to invest in a new summer wardrobe. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t in good faith do it, because I can\u2019t afford to spend my money like this.\u201d",
      "The apparel industry has taken an especially hard hit from Trump\u2019s tariff program because a vast majority of clothing, shoes and accessories are manufactured in places like China, Vietnam and India before being shipped to the U.S.",
      "Like Becker, Mei Wu, 31, who lives in Los Angeles, realized she can\u2019t splurge on shopping this year. She had her eye on a $170 dress from the Australian brand VRG GRL as an outfit for her June birthday party. But when\u00a0she saw that another\u00a0$277.95 would be tacked on to the price because of tariffs, she decided not to purchase it.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is, I do think that we deserve to be able to buy where we want to buy without getting punished for it. How we spend our money is totally up to us, and at the end of the day we work hard for what we bring to the door,\u201d said Wu, a content creator who described her shopping dilemma as a \u201cfirst world problem,\u201d but one that is frustrating all the same.",
      "A recent consumer pulse report from the accounting firm KPMG, which surveyed 1,516 U.S. consumers, found that \u201cin response to tariffs, 50% are cutting back on purchases, and 49% are actively seeking deals and discounts.\u201d When asked specifically about summer plans, many said they are still choosing to travel \u2014 but have otherwise cracked down on personal expenses.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a more selective and cost-conscious summer travel season,\u201d Duleep Rodrigo, KPMG\u2019s consumer and retail leader, said in a statement in the report. \u201cVacations are still in the budget \u2014 but nearly everything else is on the chopping block.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff policies are facing a number of legal challenges in court, with some judges calling them unlawful. However, a federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily paused rulings by a panel of judges that, just hours earlier, halted several of the president\u2019s tariffs on international trading partners.",
      "As Americans wait for news of whether tariffs will continue to be imposed, they are still hoping to have fun during summer.",
      "Patrice LaBelle Lester, 29, is spending the next few months planning her October vow renewal celebration. But she\u2019s being more frugal with her budget.",
      "For example, she said she found a way to order faux flowers \u2014 which were being shipped from China \u2014 in bulk without paying the surcharge caused by tariffs. Originally, the price was $300. With tariffs, they skyrocketed to about $1,700.",
      "So the content creator found a different vendor who would be willing to cover the cost of the tariffs so Lester could stay within her original budget. But she said she was warned that because the flowers would have to be shipped by cargo freighter, rather than by plane, there would be a delay in receiving them. Lester said she\u2019s also hoping to grow her family, which means she wants to purchase a new car over the summer.",
      "\u201cI know Trump said he was only giving, I guess, a tax break to those that buy an American-made car, but it\u2019s hard to kind of support that in this political climate,\u201d said Lester, who lives in San Antonio, Texas. \u201cSo it\u2019s impacting me in that way, because that is a purchase I would like to make\u00a0in the next few months.\u201d",
      "For Becker, there has been one unexpected perk of reeling in her spending: getting to do more activities that bring people together.",
      "\u201cA number of people are talking about, again, myself included, hoarding craft supplies for our various hobbies,\u201d she said, reflecting on how changes in her spending have also realigned her values. \u201cThe silver lining in all this is that it can, if done correctly, build community.\u201d"

      "There was little optimism for diplomatic progress even before the strike, with Ukraine sending its defense minister, Rustem Umerov, but Russia only dispatching the far more junior Putin aide, Vladimir Medinsky, to the \u00c7\u0131ra\u011fan Palace in Istanbul.",
      "Those talks have now concluded for the day, Zelenskyy said at a news conference in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius just after midday local time (9 a.m. ET). The president said that the two sides exchanged documents and were preparing a fresh round of prisoner exchanges, extending the only tangible outcome from the two sides' first meeting last month.",
      "\u201cI am waiting to hear minister Umerov\u2019s full report,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "A far more likely outcome of Sunday's strike is Russia continuing to bomb Ukrainian civilians \u2014 this time under the pretext of retaliation, \u201ceven though in reality these strikes are planned long in advance,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow with the London-based think-tank Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia program.",
      "Less hard to quantify will be the huge blow to Vladimir Putin's pride, with Western analysts in agreement that this was a humiliation for the Russian president.",
      "\u201cAt a time when Putin seems to think that he is winning on the battlefield, this demonstrates that his forces are in fact very vulnerable,\u201d said Sven Biscop, a director at the Egmont Institute, a think tank in Brussels. \u201cThis may not change the course of the war, but it does mean that every gain Russia makes will be at high cost.\u201d",
      "He added it was \u201cquite amazing\u201d that \u201ca significant part of their bomber force\u201d could \u201cbe destroyed like that.\u201d",
      "The strike took a year and a half to plan, according to Zelenskyy, and played out on the eve of the latest round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.",
      "It's still unclear what impact the surgical strike will have on Monday's negotiations, hopes for which were already dim thanks to the deep divisions between the positions of Kyiv and Moscow. Ukraine says it is ready to sign an unconditional 30-day ceasefire; Russia is essentially demanding Ukraine's surrender.",
      "Brokering the talks, President Donald Trump has shifted from the unambiguously pro-Ukrainian stance of his predecessor, President Joe Biden, and offered concessions to the Kremlin that have outraged many in the West.",
      "At the same time, he accused Putin last week of going \u201cabsolutely crazy\u201d by continuing to launch regular attacks on Ukraine civilians. Ultimately, he has threatened to walk away from the peace talks if they do not yield the results he once promised he would achieve in just 24 hours.",
      "Indeed, overnight into Sunday, Russia launched some 500 attack drones into Ukraine, Zelenskyy said. The night next came 84 more, with at least 10 people killed and dozens more injured across the country, Ukraine's air force said.",
      "Other pro-Russia observers are calling for even more drastic measures.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the response will be the same as the U.S. response to the attack on Pearl Harbor, or even tougher,\u201d one Russian military blogger, Roman Alekhin, said on the messaging app Telegram.",
      "Another pro-war Telegram channel, Dva Mayora, added that it was \u201ca reason to launch nuclear strikes on Ukraine\" \u2014 a threat often made by Putin since launching the invasion three years ago.",
      "\u201cWe can expect a great deal of sound and fury from Moscow,\u201d Giles said. Russia \u201cwill be working hard on convincing the United States to attempt to rein Ukraine in, in order to prevent any further damage to Russia\u2019s means of bombarding Ukrainian cities with long range missiles,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cIn a way, the more important question is how the United States reacts, and how eager it is to take Moscow\u2018s side and constrain Ukraine,\u201d he said.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London and Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv."

      "\"I guess we have to discuss what I looked like on that runway, because the internet is so fascinated with my age, my weight, my face, my hair,\" she said.",
      "Frankel, 54, wore several bathing suits during the runway event in Miami, including a one-piece swimsuit with cheetah print and pink bikini with black polka dots, plus a black mesh cover-up that she took off at one point.",
      "\"Listen, I can tell you with great certainty that every woman that was with me on that stage did not look that way two hours prior,\" Frankel said. \"OK, it was everybody's job, and that's what goes on in Hollywood, in the entertainment industry, and the images that you and your daughters see of women, of Kim Kardashian, of Beyonc\u00e9, of J.Lo, of every famous person, that there is a lot of work that goes into that, a lot of glam, a lot of contouring, a lot of lighting, a lot.\"",
      "Frankel added that she does not normally wear makeup, and that she doesn't crash diet.",
      "\"I don't go to a gym. I don't have a workout. I walk on the beach. Everything I do has balance. I self-regulate so I have a good relationship with food and exercise,\" she said. \"It wasn't always that way. This is not that I have a good metabolism or just good genes, because I used to be 25 pounds heavier in my early 30s.\"",
      "Frankel said she doesn't have issues with \"food noise\" or \"exercise noise\" at this point in her life.",
      "\"The reason my body is natural is because the exercise that I do, and have always done for my body is natural. I'll go months without exercise, and definitely days without doing anything, but I always come back to it,\" she said. \"I have a good relationship with it, and I have a good relationship with food because it's the obsession, it's the extremes, it's the binging, it's the emotions, it's the noise. That is why we are struggling.\"",
      "She concluded by telling her followers, \"I want you to allow yourselves to have, but not beat yourselves up when you do indulge. And I want you to have a good relationship with food and exercise.\"",
      "Frankel spoke more about her experience participating in the show in a June 1 Instagram post.",
      "\"There are so many things I could say about the Sports Illustrated experience. I didn't know much going into it. I mean, I know it's a magazine, and I know that once a year they do a swimsuit issue,\" she said.",
      "\"What I didn't know is what the culture is like there. And I didn't know who 90% of the women were. I will tell you that the resounding theme and culture is women supporting women,\" she continued.",
      "Frankel said the women at the event were not just giving compliments, but asking about what people were planning to do during their walks and helping them with their ideas.",
      "\"I have to say that as much as the runway show was really fun ... I wasn't nervous. I was aware of my age. I was aware that I'm not a model, and there were a lot of models, and I was just like, 'Am I gonna stick this landing or make an absolute fool myself and embarrass you guys?'\" she said.",
      "In the caption of another Instagram post, she summarized the event: \"This runway show was such an amazing experience and I am forever grateful to my community here in Florida and the people for your endless support.\""

      "Jenna Bush Hager is overcome by emotion and admits she\u2019s going to cry.",
      "Standing on a stage at the W Nashville at 9 a.m., in front of navy-blue bookshelves created for this moment, Jenna reflects on six years of her book club. Or, as she puts it, \u201cRead With Jenna is in kindergarten!\u201d",
      "The book club started as a dare to prove that people still read \u2014 the festival, which unfolded over May 30 and 31 and was sponsored by Music City, is proof that she was right.",
      "Since Read With Jenna launched in 2019, Jenna has chosen 80 books and counting, with a focus on championing debut and diverse voices. Fifty books became bestsellers. And 15 of the club\u2019s authors are in the room at the Read With Jenna Book Festival.",
      "The first ever live gathering of Jenna\u2019s book community and authors is the culmination of years of work. But it\u2019s also the product of a lifetime.",
      "Jenna, onstage, talks about the two grandmothers and mother whose love of reading molded her into the woman, and literary tastemaker, she is. She says Jenna Welch, her namesake, read to explore beyond her life in central Texas. Her grandmother Barbara Bush read for connection and enjoyed reading her granddaughters\u2019 selections. Her mother, Laura Bush, a librarian, read for purpose.",
      "You could say Jenna reads for all those reasons \u2014 plus, perhaps, change-making. In addition to bringing people together around her monthly picks, Jenna is starting her own imprint and having a hand in shaping books that go out into the world. (The first book, \u201cConform,\u201d is out later this year.)",
      "At the Read With Jenna Book Festival, audience members experienced the magic of books. While reading is a solitary act, Jenna believes a shared love of books, and the conversation they inspire, can bring people together.",
      "On the morning of May 31, the room was full of about 200 readers from more than 35 states around the country \u2014 cities including Atlanta, Charleston, Chicago, Huntsville, Alabama and of course, Nashville.",
      "Many attendees were friends, like an Elin Hilderbrand-loving duo who met in high school and Amy Sixbey and Cindy Hedges, who met at a yarn store they later co-owned. (Hedges and Sixbey, who are in multiple book clubs each, give advice for running one: Meet once a month and \"read the book.\")",
      "Another woman gave an instant \u201cyes\u201d the moment her sister sent the event\u2019s registration link.",
      "Multiple sets of mothers and daughters at the festival said reading keeps them together even as their lives diverge. \"We communicate through the books we read,\" Patti Grote of Chicago said, next to her grown daughter. \"Bad on Paper\" cohost and novelist Olivia Muenter got her mom tickets for Mother's Day.",
      "Many came by themselves, like one woman who wore Read With Jenna merch she hand-bedazzled for the event \u2014 a jean jacket for the VIP event on Friday and another T-shirt for Saturday\u2019s mainstage. When a 20-year-old couldn't find a friend to join her, she drove by herself.",
      "The day began around 8 a.m. with breakfast and mingling. On the sunny terraces of the W Nashville overlooking Nashville's Gulch district, longtime friends sat side-by-side with solo travelers.",
      "Before events started, and throughout the day, attendees stopped by the many vendors, picking charms to feature on bracelets from local store Charm Bar (cowboy hats and books were popular options), decorating book-shaped cookies from Butterfly Bakehouse, creating a bouquet from Amelia's Flowers, assembling bags of children's books for local libraries and getting their tarot cards read by Sarah Jane Chapman. They also perused pop-ups \u2014 Parnassus Books, the record store Groove and Shop TODAY.",
      "The itinerary was stacked enough to impress a preteen. When Jenna called her eldest daughter Mila to describe the day, Mila responded, \u201cJenna, are you trying to make me jealous?\u201d",
      "Following breakfast came what could only be called a literary marathon. Stepping through the secret door in the bookcase were two bestselling authors, whose chats with Jenna will eventually feature on the Open Book with Jenna podcast.",
      "First, Jenna spoke to \u201cTom Lake\u201d author Ann Patchett about the nun who taught her to read, running a bookstore in Nashville and why she doesn\u2019t have a cell phone.",
      "Jenna also marveled at the full circle moment their conversation represented: At 18, Jenna and her twin Barbara Bush said Donna Tartt and Patchett were their favorite authors \u2014 and now, she was sitting on stage with Patchett. (Patchett said she and Tartt were chuffed by the Bush twins' answer at the time).",
      "From the back of the room, the next speaker, Elin Hilderbrand looked on wearing a white dress that contrasted with her perpetual Nantucket tan. Hilderbrand took the stage after Patchett to discuss whether she\u2019s really retiring, writing with her daughter and how, after 25 years, she\u2019s ushering in a new era: Adaptations.",
      "She and Jenna also shared some news: They are collaborating on a screen project \u2014 but, as Jenna said, \"We can't share much.\" Hilderbrand's fans (\u201cHilderbabes,\" as they're called), will be delighted but not surprised to know that throughout the day of the festival, the best-selling author took breaks out by the pool.",
      "From there, attendees shuffled between the day\u2019s activities. There were interactive book club sessions with Read With Jenna authors Amity Gaige (\u201cHeartwood\u201d), Emma Straub (\u201cAll Adults Here\u201d) and Christina Henriquez (\u201cThe Great Divide\u201d), asking questions about the novels and answering questions about how they were personally moved.",
      "Later came a chance to tap into their creative sides in workshops led by novelist Jessica Soffer (\u201cThis Is a Love Story\u201d) and songwriter Eric Paslay.",
      "After lunch, comedian Tiffany Haddish took the mainstage with Jenna. Haddish got deep, fast, about how her past trauma informs her comedy, and her revelations about her childhood in the foster care system inspired an attendee to share her own story.",
      "One undeniable highlight came when Haddish \u201ccursed\u201d the audience with joy \u2014 \u201cI curse you with all the joy and abundance and success you can handle. You deserve to be happy.\u201d Another unplanned moment came when she and Paslay collaborated on a moving song about her.",
      "The day rounded out with a celebration of what makes Read With Jenna so special: Its authors (who Jenna calls rock stars).",
      "Jenna moderated a panel with multiple Read With Jenna authors (Coco Mellors, Rumaan Alam, Jean Kwok, Alison Espach, and Chris Whitaker, plus a cameo from Mellors\u2019 son, Indigo). Then, lines formed for signings with all the authors in attendance, a list that included Cara Wall, Diane Marie Brown and Tara Stringfellow, too.",
      "Almost 11 hours after the Read With Jenna Book Festival started at 8 a.m., the crowd gathered to listen to singer Blessing Offor perform. (Holly Williams performed with her husband during the VIP event \u2014 it's Music City, after all).",
      "Jenna, overcome yet again, thanked attendees \u2014 and made, if not a firm promise, then the hope of one.",
      "\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll make this an annual pilgrimage. Until then I hope you connect with us,\" she said."

      "Bader shared photos and videos from the milestone moment on her Instagram June 1 that showed her smiling wide and throwing her hands up in the air as she fully embraced the spotlight.",
      "In the caption, she penned a \u201csappy long\u201d statement about why the runway show was so meaningful after opening up about her weight loss and surgery.",
      "\u201cThe past two months since I opened up about my surgery and everything I\u2019ve been through mentally and physically over the past year and a half, I have been feeling quite a range of emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore I walked the runway last night, my dear friend, @noordinarynoire asked me how I was feeling \u2014 and I told her: not the way I thought I would.\u201d",
      "She said she was unsure who she would represent when she appeared on the catwalk because she doesn\u2019t know where she fits in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not plus size, I\u2019m not skinny\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what people wanted me to stand for and I didn\u2019t like not having an answer,\u201d she wrote.",

      "\u201cAnd in that moment, something finally clicked,\u201d the TikToker wrote. \u201cSince I started sharing my life online 5 years ago, I\u2019ve constantly tried to figure out which box I belong in based on solely what others want me to be in and that has only been based on my appearance. But last night, I simply just stood for every girl or woman who\u2019s felt lost about where she belongs, but still chooses to show up and put herself out there no matter what.\u201d",
      "She said that was all she needed to embody when she walked the runway.",
      "Bader continued, \u201cLooking at these unedited photos and not wishing to change a thing reminds me how far I\u2019ve come \u2014 not for vanity, but for my mental, emotional, and physical health. To go from not knowing if I\u2019d ever be able to walk out of my house again a year ago, to walking that runway confidently, smiling, and not thinking twice about what anyone else saw, but how good I FELT \u2014 and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never take for granted.\u201d",
      "To conclude, she expressed her gratitude to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit for asking her to participate.",
      "\u201cAnd sorry (but very much not sorry) for the long caption,\u201d she cheekily added and included a white heart.",
      "As she mentioned in her post, Bader has opened up in the past about her health journey. In March, she revealed in an interview with Self magazine that she underwent a weight loss surgery called single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass (SADI-S) in December 2023. The procedure is a hybrid of gastric sleeve and gastric bypass.",
      "She described the recovery process as \u201cthe most brutal thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was in recovery hours, hours, hours, hours, throwing up. It was not normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was supposed to leave (the hospital) in one day. I could not stop projectile vomiting, and I couldn\u2019t drink water. They won\u2019t let you leave if you can\u2019t drink water. I actually can\u2019t explain how horrible it was.\u201d",
      "Bader continued to struggle as she recovered. She shared that she fell into a \u201cdeep depression\u201d that was \u201cthe scariest time of my life.\u201d",
      "But, she said later in the interview that she has improved.",
      "\u201cAm I happy overall right now, happier than when I was dealing with the health issues and the back pain and all those things? Yes. I have more energy. All of my health stuff went back to normal after years and years and years,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "She added, \u201cI think I\u2019ve let so many people take my power away for a long time. I will never regret having my time to heal, and I\u2019m still healing and figuring it out. ... That was none of the internet\u2019s business\u2014these people that don\u2019t know me\u2014and that was for me to figure out.\u201d"

The singer was branded a \u201csnake\u201d and hashtags like \u201c#KimExposedTaylorParty\u201d went viral.",

      "It was a stunning, audacious attack whose widespread effects are only just becoming clear.",
      "Ukraine managed to smuggle 117 aerial drones on the backs of trucks that deposited them at the perimeter of four Russian air bases \u2014 one of them deep inside Siberia some 2,500 miles from Ukraine's borders, according to Ukrainian officials.",
      "While there are differing accounts on the extent of the ensuing damage of Sunday\u2019s \u201cSpiderweb\u201d operation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 40 Russian aircraft \u2014 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers  \u2014 were hit. Ukraine's security service, the SBU, put the estimated cost to the Kremlin at $7 billion.",
      "Some military commentators and pro-Russian bloggers have called it the country's \"Pearl Harbor\" \u2014 a reference to Japanese attack in 1941 that saw the United States enter World War II.",
      "It came Sunday, a day before the latest round of direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on Monday.",
      "There was little optimism for diplomatic progress even before the strike, with Ukraine sending its defense minister, Rustem Umerov, but Russia only dispatching the far more junior Putin aide, Vladimir Medinsky, to the \u00c7\u0131ra\u011fan Palace in Istanbul.",
      "Those talks have now concluded for the day, Zelenskyy said at a news conference in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius just after midday local time (9 a.m. ET). The president said that the two sides exchanged documents and were preparing a fresh round of prisoner exchanges, extending the only tangible outcome from the two sides' first meeting last month.",
      "\u201cI am waiting to hear minister Umerov\u2019s full report,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "A far more likely outcome of Sunday's strike is Russia continuing to bomb Ukrainian civilians \u2014 this time under the pretext of retaliation, \u201ceven though in reality these strikes are planned long in advance,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow with the London-based think-tank Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia program.",
      "Less hard to quantify will be the huge blow to Vladimir Putin's pride, with Western analysts in agreement that this was a humiliation for the Russian president.",
      "\u201cAt a time when Putin seems to think that he is winning on the battlefield, this demonstrates that his forces are in fact very vulnerable,\u201d said Sven Biscop, a director at the Egmont Institute, a think tank in Brussels. \u201cThis may not change the course of the war, but it does mean that every gain Russia makes will be at high cost.\u201d",
      "He added it was \u201cquite amazing\u201d that \u201ca significant part of their bomber force\u201d could \u201cbe destroyed like that.\u201d",
      "The strike took a year and a half to plan, according to Zelenskyy, and played out on the eve of the latest round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.",
      "It's still unclear what impact the surgical strike will have on Monday's negotiations, hopes for which were already dim thanks to the deep divisions between the positions of Kyiv and Moscow. Ukraine says it is ready to sign an unconditional 30-day ceasefire; Russia is essentially demanding Ukraine's surrender.",
      "Brokering the talks, President Donald Trump has shifted from the unambiguously pro-Ukrainian stance of his predecessor, President Joe Biden, and offered concessions to the Kremlin that have outraged many in the West.",
      "At the same time, he accused Putin last week of going \u201cabsolutely crazy\u201d by continuing to launch regular attacks on Ukraine civilians. Ultimately, he has threatened to walk away from the peace talks if they do not yield the results he once promised he would achieve in just 24 hours.",
      "Indeed, overnight into Sunday, Russia launched some 500 attack drones into Ukraine, Zelenskyy said. The night next came 84 more, with at least 10 people killed and dozens more injured across the country, Ukraine's air force said.",
      "Other pro-Russia observers are calling for even more drastic measures.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the response will be the same as the U.S. response to the attack on Pearl Harbor, or even tougher,\u201d one Russian military blogger, Roman Alekhin, said on the messaging app Telegram.",
      "Another pro-war Telegram channel, Dva Mayora, added that it was \u201ca reason to launch nuclear strikes on Ukraine\" \u2014 a threat often made by Putin since launching the invasion three years ago.",
      "\u201cWe can expect a great deal of sound and fury from Moscow,\u201d Giles said. Russia \u201cwill be working hard on convincing the United States to attempt to rein Ukraine in, in order to prevent any further damage to Russia\u2019s means of bombarding Ukrainian cities with long range missiles,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cIn a way, the more important question is how the United States reacts, and how eager it is to take Moscow\u2018s side and constrain Ukraine,\u201d he said.",

      "Despite a leg injury, he said he felt he should join the army to protect his homeland. But during his first deployment in Gaza late last year, he said he quickly became disillusioned by the destruction he witnessed.",
      "Sent to southern Gaza when Israel resumed its military campaign in March, Ben Ari said he came to the realization that he could no longer serve in good conscience. So a week into his monthlong rotation, he said he asked his commander to be relieved of his duty and made his way to the border.",

    "summary": "K-pop, which has been unofficially banned in China for almost a decade, may be on the verge of being allowed back in.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The concert was set to be small but significant: the first by an all-Korean K-pop band in mainland China after an unofficial ban on such shows for almost a decade.",
      "That was exciting news for fans like Haerin Ouyang, a university student in the coastal Chinese city of Fuzhou, where the South Korean boy band Epex had been scheduled to perform on Saturday.",
      "But the show was canceled earlier this month, less than two weeks after it was announced, leaving Ouyang \u201cheartbroken.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,\u201d she said.",
      "C9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited \u201clocal circumstances\u201d in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.",
      "The ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.",
      "Before the ban, China \u2014 the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan \u2014 was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.",
      "\u201cIn the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China\u2019s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,\u201d said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.",
      "The China ban is estimated to have cost the South Korean economy almost $16 billion since 2016, she said.",
      "But the Epex concert\u2019s cancellation does not necessarily reflect the official position of the Chinese government, Kang cautioned, as China has been gradually reopening to South Korean culture after years of tension.",
      "While K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.",
      "A large-scale K-pop joint concert is also scheduled to be held in September at a 40,000-seat stadium in the Chinese island province of Hainan. The Korea Entertainment Producers\u2019 Association, which announced the event in April, did not reply to an email asking whether that concert is still going ahead.",
      "Kang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would \u201cproceed without issue.\u201d",
      "There are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China\u2019s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.",
      "\u201cIt shows that there is a greater opportunity for collaboration between the two countries, especially in the entertainment industry,\u201d said Ellen Kim, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. \u201cIt might be a starting point for industry-level cooperation that could open more doors between the two countries.\u201d",
      "The diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.",
      "China\u2019s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.",
      "In addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop\u2019s high-spending fans.",
      "China has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever.",
      "\u201cIt now has robust resilience against the \u2018invasion\u2019 of foreign content,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s potential thaw toward South Korean entertainment comes as it further restricts the number of Hollywood films allowed to be screened in its theaters in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "China-South Korea ties could also get a boost from next week\u2019s South Korean presidential election. The front-runner, Lee Jae-myung, is considered friendlier to China than his predecessor.",
      "\u201cIf he wins, it might be a matter of time that things will change, which will allow the Korean entertainers to come into the country and play their music,\u201d Kim said."

      "LIVERPOOL, England \u2014 Images of a car plowing into a large crowd of soccer fans celebrating their team's English Premier League title win had barely made it to national newscasts when notorious right-wing voices started to call the incident a \"suspected terrorist attack\" on social media.",
      "The X account of Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster who is well known as the leader of the English far right, retweeted video of the vehicle knocking down people dressed in Liverpool Football Club\u2019s ketchup-red strip, writing that it looked \"very intentional.\" (The posts were labeled \"admin,\" a probable reference to the fact that Robinson did not write them himself since he was in prison at the time.)",
      "Others swiftly followed suit, opining that the driver had been motivated by Islamic extremism.",
      "Within a couple of hours, Merseyside Police released details on a suspect detained at the scene, describing him as a 53-year-old white British male from the Liverpool area. Officials also urged the public \u201cnot to speculate on the circumstances\u201d surrounding the incident. Within five hours, police had described the incident as \u201cisolated\u201d and not being investigated as terrorism-related.",
      "The release of these details by the British police, most notably the suspect\u2019s race, was remarkably fast.",
      "For many, it was a sign of lessons learned after the 2024 Southport stabbing attack, in which the same police force was pilloried for not sharing enough information soon enough and allowing rumors to run rampant. In this vacuum, speculation turned into calls for action, which soon bloomed into racist riots that rocked Britain in the aftermath of the deadly assault that killed three young girls, with more injured.",
      "In Southport, violent riots erupted last summer after false information shared on social media claimed the suspect in the stabbings was a radical Islamist migrant. Police were accused of failing to share accurate information on the suspect quickly enough, allowing rumors to circulate unchallenged.",
      "On Tuesday, Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram praised Merseyside Police for having \u201chandled the situation fantastically\u201d in an interview with Sky News.",
      "Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent, described the force\u2019s swift release of information, including details on the race of the man arrested in the incident, as \u201cunprecedented.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never known a case like this before where they\u2019ve given the ethnicity and the race of the individual who was involved in it,\u201d Babu told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI think that was to dampen down some of the speculation from the far-right that sort of continues on X even as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that it appeared to be a lesson learned as a direct result of what happened after the Southport attack.",
      "In that case, he noted rumors swelled of the suspect being \u201can asylum seeker who arrived on a boat and it was a Muslim extremist \u2014 and that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Jaundrill said the suspect had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs.",
      "Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims separately said police believed the man arrested had been able to follow an ambulance responding to reports of a member of the public having a heart attack, after a road block was temporarily lifted.",
      "More than 50 people were initially taken to or showed up at hospitals for treatment, with children among those hurt. Eleven people remained in the hospital for ongoing treatment, but all appeared to be in \u201cstable condition\u201d and \u201crecovering well,\u201d police said.",
      "Lessons learned",
      "Darrin Hooper, who traveled with his wife from Maidstone, Kent, just over 30 miles southeast of London, to celebrate Liverpool's win, praised the police\u2019s quick response on the scene as well as on social media.",
      "\u201cIt was a good thing that they announced it straight away,\u201d he said  Tuesday as he stood among a crowd gathered on the edges of scene of Monday's incident, which had been cordoned off.",

      "Sneha Venket, who traveled to the city with her husband, a major Liverpool F.C. fan, all the way from Cologne, Germany, to join in the parade, described the events that unfolded Monday as a \u201cvery bitter end to a very, very happy day.\u201d",
      "Recalling the grim events of last year in the eastern German city of Magdeburg, in which a 9-year-old child and four adults were killed after a car was driven into a crowd at a Christmas market,  Venket, 39, said she wasn\u2019t surprised to see speculation swirl in the aftermath of Monday\u2019s incident. In that case too, Europe\u2019s far right was quick to tap into fears around the deadly attack.",
      "Venket, who is studying screenwriting, said it was important to allow police to investigate before jumping to conclusions, but, she said, \u201cnowadays, it looks like society is more polarized than ever, every society.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Britain\u2019s King Charles III outlined new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s government priorities at the country's Parliament on Tuesday in what is being seen as a show of support in the face of President Donald Trump's threats to annex America's neighbor.",
      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them. Fundamental change is always unsettling,\" he said in the speech, switching between English and French.",
      "The country faces another \"critical moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values that Canadians hold dear and one which the government is determined to protect,\" Charles said. \"The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada\u2019s relationships with partners is also changing.\"",
      "Charles said Carney and Trump \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship,\u201d adding that it was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "Charles, still undergoing cancer treatment, is the nonpartisan head of state in Canada \u2014 a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies \u2014 but he did not write the speech. Instead, he read what was presented to him by Canada\u2019s government in the country\u2019s capital, Ottawa.",
      "Among them was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who wore green and orange sneakers with his suit.",
      "\"Every time I come to Canada, a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart,\" Charles said. \"I\u2019ve always had the greatest admiration for Canada\u2019s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defense of national values and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.\"",
      "Concluding his speech, Charles praised Canada as a \"force for good\" in the world.",
      "\"As the anthem reminds us: The true north is indeed strong and free,\" he said, earning a round of applause from lawmakers.",
      "Before the speech, Charles was taken to the Senate of Canada Building in a horse-drawn carriage with Queen Camilla. There, he received the Royal Salute from the 100-person guard of honor from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment before he entered the chamber.",
      "Charles also met Monday with Carney and Mary Simon, Canada's first Indigenous governor general, who is the king\u2019s representative to the country.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the royal family, and it is rare for the monarch to deliver what is known as the Speech from the Throne. The last time was in 1977, when Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, read it for only the second time in her 70-year reign.",
      "But Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he secured victory in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said in a statement Monday that Charles\u2019 visit spoke \u201cto the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity, and to the historic ties that crises only fortify.\u201d",
      "It was a change in tone from earlier this month, when he criticized Britain\u2019s invitation to Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against Trump\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
      "Since he took office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left the U.K. trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.",
      "Charles has also made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree and referring to himself as the king of Canada.",
      "Even so, Carney this month told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, that Canadians \u201cweren\u2019t impressed\u201d by Trump\u2019s invitation to the palace.",
      "\u201cIt was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,\u201d he said.",
      "Charles will return to the U.K. later Tuesday, after the speech and a visit to Canada\u2019s National War Memorial."

      "Others in the chess community offered a bit more support for Gukesh's performance.",
      "Gukesh also reportedly told Chess.com that he could relate to Carlsen's reaction: \u201cI\u2019ve also banged a lot of tables in my career!\u201d",
      "Carlsen retains his title as the top-ranked player by the International Chess Federation (FIDE), which calculates ratings based on performances across sanctioned tournaments. Carlsen is also a five-time world chess champion, a title awarded for winning the game's most presitigious tournament (The Candidates Tournament) and besting the current world champion (or with the current champion beating the winner of the Candidates).",
      "Carlsen declined to defend the title in 2022, with China's Ding Liren taking the top spot only to be defeated by Gukesh in 2024. Then only 18, Gukesh became the youngest world champion in history.",
      "That has meant something of a natural rivarly between the two.",
      "Carlsen has previously praised the Indian phenom, noting recently in an appearance on the podcast The Joe Rogan Experience that Gukesh \"works his a-- off all time time\" but also is not as strong as some of the shorter time formats that have gained in popularity and prestige in recent years.",
      "Along with the embrace of shorter time formats, chess has boomed online, with a boom in coverage and content creators who analyze games in real time and provide plenty of commentary.",
      "And with Carlsen still by far the game's top star, a blunder and loss \u2014 and reaction\u00a0\u2014 like the one to Gukesh has sparked its own compilations of reactions."

    "story": [
      "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico held its first judicial elections Sunday, stirring controversy and sowing confusion among voters who struggled to understand a process set to transform the country's court system.",
      "Polls closed and poll workers began counting colored ballots Sunday night with the question hanging in the air of what will become of Mexico's judiciary, the answer to which will only emerge in the coming days as results roll in.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority announced late in the night that 13% of Mexico's 100 million voters cast ballots at the polls, lagging far behind the 60% turnout just a year before during the country's presidential election.",
      "Nevertheless, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called the voting \"a complete success.\"",
      "\"Mexico is the most democratic country in the world,\" she added.",
      "Experts warned of startling low turnout in the lead up to the historic elections due to the mindboggling array of unfamiliar choices and the novelty of voting for judges. Experts say those factors may throw into question the legitimacy of the election, which has faced months of fierce scrutiny.",
      "Sheinbaum, a member of Mexico's ruling party, Morena, rejected the criticisms and insisted the election would only only make Mexico more democratic and root out corruption in a system that most people in the country believe is broken.",
      "\"Whoever says that there is authoritarianism in Mexico is lying,\" she said. \"Mexico is a country that is only becoming more free, just and democratic because that is the will of the people.\"",
      "While some voters said they felt pushed to vote in an election they felt would determine the fate of the country's democracy, many more expressed a deep sense of apathy, citing disillusionment due to decades of corruption and lack of basic information about the vote.",
      "\"I'm not interested (in voting). Parties and their messages \u2014 they come and they go. It's all the same,\" said Raul Bernal, a 50-year-old factory worker in downtown Mexico City walking is dog.",
      "A historic vote",
      "Even without the final tally, the results of the vote are set to transform Mexic",
      "o's judiciary. Morena overhauled the court system late last year, fueling protests and criticism that the reform is an attempt by those in power to seize on their political popularity to gain control of the branch of government until now out of their reach.",
      "\"It's an effort to control the court system, which has been a sort of thorn in the side\" of those in power, said Laurence Patin, director of the legal organization Juicio Justo in Mexico. \"But it's a counter-balance, which exists in every healthy democracy.\"",
      "Instead of judges being appointed on a system of merit and experience, Mexican voters have cast ballots to choose between some 7,700 candidates vying for more than 2,600 judicial positions.",
      "Mexicans head to the polls",
      "Some of the country's voting centers opened with only a trickle of people and small lines forming throughout the day.",
      "Esteban Hern\u00e1ndez, a 31-year-old veterinary student, said he didn't agree with electing judges and doesn't support Morena, but came to vote because \"since there isn't much participation, my vote will count more.\"",
      "He had studied the candidates on a website listing their qualifications and decided to pick those who had doctorates. Other critics said they only voted for the Supreme Court and other top courts.",
      "Francisco Torres de Le\u00f3n, a 62-year-old retired teacher in southern Mexico, called the process \"painstaking because there are too many candidates and positions that they're going to fill.\"",
      "Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who had pushed through the judicial reform but remained out of the public eye since leaving office last year, voted in Chiapas near his ranch.",
      "\"I wanted to participate in this historic election,\" he said. \"Never in the history of our country \u2026 have the people decided and had the right to elect judges.\"",
      "Democratic concerns",
      "The process has raised concerns.",
      "Civil society organizations like Defensorxs have raised red flags about a range of candidates running for election, including lawyers who represented some of Mexico's most feared cartel leaders and local officials who were forced to resign from their positions due to corruption scandals.",
      "Also among those putting themselves forward are ex-convicts imprisoned for years for drug trafficking to the United States and a slate of candidates with ties to a religious group whose spiritual leader is behind bars in California after pleading guilty to sexually abusing minors.",
      "Others like Martha Tamayo, a lawyer and former congresswoman from conflict-ravaged Sinaloa, cast doubt on projections that the election could hand even more power over to criminals and criminal groups, simply because they already have a strong control over courts.",
      "\"The influence of criminal groups already exists,\" she said. \"The cartels go with the judges (bribe them) whether they are elected or not.\"",
      "'You have to start with something'",
      "The public has been plagued by confusion over a voting process that Patin warned has been hastily thrown together. Voters often have to choose from more than a hundred candidates who are not permitted to clearly voice their party affiliation or carry out widespread campaigning.",
      "As a result, many Mexicans said they were going into the vote blind, though others voting Sunday noted they supported the process despite the confusion.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority has investigated voter guides being handed out across the country, in what critics say is a blatant move by political parties to stack the vote in their favor.",
      "\"Political parties weren't just going to sit with their arms crossed,\" Patin said.",
      "While still unsure if his vote would improve access to justice for many Mexicans, 61-year-old actor Manuel Jos\u00e9 Contreras defended the election, Sheinbaum and her party. He cast his ballot with a tone of hope.",
      "\"The reform has its problems but we needed an urgent change,\" he said. \"You have to start with something.\""

    "summary": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki has won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count.",
    "story": [
      "WARSAW, Poland \u2014 Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland\u2019s weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%.",
      "The race had Poland on edge since a first round of voting two weeks earlier, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.",
      "An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture a couple of hours later.",
      "The outcome suggests that Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.",
      "Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.",
      "Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide \u2014 so broad that it hasn\u2019t been able to fulfill certain of Tusk\u2019s electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples.",
      "But Duda\u2019s veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic.",
      "Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made to both voters and the E.U.",
      "Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if the Law and Justice party dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.",
      "Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by Law and Justice as part of its push for a fresh start.",
      "The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party\u2019s eight years of rule.",
      "Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \u201cnoble\u201d fights in his life. The revelations did not seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland\u2019s president.",
      "He welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland, and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.",
      "A common refrain from Nawrocki\u2019s supporters is that he will restore \u201cnormality,\u201d as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki\u2019s rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Nawrocki has also echoed some of Trump\u2019s language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland\u2019s support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling."

      "An Ipsos exit poll released when the voting ended showed that liberal Warsaw mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski won 50.3% of the vote and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki won 49.7%. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points and the final vote is likely to change somewhat.",

Nawrocki, 42, has positioned himself as a defender of traditional Polish values, skeptical of the EU and aligned with U.S. conservatives, including President Donald Trump.",
      "Nawrocki's candidacy has been clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and participation in a violent street battle. He denies the criminal links but acknowledges having taken part in \"noble\" fights.

      "Amid rising security fears over Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine, both candidates support aid to Kyiv, though Nawrocki opposes NATO membership for Ukraine, while Trzaskowski supports it in the future.",

      "ROME \u2014 Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg and other 11 activists will set sail on Sunday afternoon for Gaza on a ship aimed at \u201cbreaking Israel\u2019s siege\u201d of the devastated territory, organizers said.",
      "The sailing boat Madleen \u2014 operated by activist group Freedom Flotilla Coalition \u2014 will embark from the Sicilian port of Catania, in southern Italy.",
      "It will try to reach the shores of the Gaza Strip in an effort to bring in some aid and raise \u201cinternational awareness\u201d over the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the activists said at a press conference on Sunday, ahead of departure.",
      "\u201cWe are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying,\u201d Thunberg said, bursting into tears during her speech.",
      "\u201cBecause the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it\u2019s not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the live-streamed genocide,\u201d she added.",
      "Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic \u201cblood libel.\u201d",
      "In mid-May, Israel slightly eased its blockade of Gaza after nearly three months, allowing a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the territory.",
      "Experts have warned that Gaza is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "Among those joining the crew of the Madleen are \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Liam Cunningham and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent. She has been barred from entering Israel due to her active opposition to the Israeli assault on Gaza.",
      "The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped.",
      "Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month.",
      "That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group\u2019s vessels, the \u201cConscience\u201d, was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.",
      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",
      "The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza\u2019s civilians.",
      "\u201cWe are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that\u2019s part of a broader strategy of mobilizations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,\u201d said activist Thiago Avila.",
      "Avila cited the upcoming Global March to Gaza \u2014 an international initiative also open to doctors, lawyers and media \u2014 which is set to leave Egypt and reach the Rafah crossing in mid-June to stage a protest there, asking Israel to stop the Gaza offensive and reopen the border."

      "Security had been tightened up in anticipation of potential post-match violence, and 5,400 police officers were deployed on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, other key parts of Paris and its nearby suburbs."
