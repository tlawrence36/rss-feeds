      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kid Cudi is the latest celebrity being called to testify at Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2032 sex trafficking trial in New York.",
      "The popular melodic rapper is expected to take the stand Thursday and tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "According to court filings and testimony, the Cassie-Cudi relationship, which grew out of the two working on music together, sent Combs into rages in which he beat her. Prosecutors contend that Combs was so upset he arranged to have Cudi\u2019s convertible firebombed.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his status as a power broker to abuse women.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the 41-year-old Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi.",
      "The Cleveland born-and-raised, skinny-jean wearing, Grammy Award-winning rapper has long been celebrated for his alternative hip-hop, emotional music that effortlessly weaves genres together in surprising ways.",
      "Music blogs and other tastemakers quickly caught on to Cudi's 2007 single, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite,\u201d with its unique singsong style that later appeared on his blockbuster 2009 debut, \u201cMan on the Moon: The End of the Day\u201d as \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite (Nightmare).\" The album's hits included \u201cPursuit of Happiness (Nightmare)\u201d and is easily one of the most influential rap records of the last two decades. In September, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite\u201d was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.",
      "Cudi began as something of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West, when the then-uncontroversial rapper signed Cudi to his G.O.O.D. Music label in 2008. Cudi left in 2013.",
      "He is featured on Jay-Z's \u201cThe Blueprint 3\u201d and West's landmark \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d Cudi has always had an eye and ear toward innovation. In 2022, his album \u201cEntergalactic\u201d was released alongside a Netflix adult-animated romantic comedy of the same name, which he told The Associated Press allowed him to \u201cexplore the abstract.\u201d",
      "Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, has been the trial\u2019s central witness with her accounts of years of violence and sexual abuse.",
      "She testified that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi in 2011 to work on music. The two began dating soon after, and she said she got a burner phone to communicate with Cudi in secret.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in sex parties that Combs orchestrated. It was during one of these that Combs looked at her phone and learned of the Cudi relationship, Cassie testified.",
      "In response, she said he lunged at her with a corkscrew and kicked her in the back.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country in 2012, Combs told her that Cudi\u2019s car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi\u2019s friends there to see it, Cassie testified.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie\u2019s mother, Regina Ventura, testified that Cassie told her Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother\u2019s Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and she broke up with him, fearing for both of their safety.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",
      "His latest album, \u201cInsano,\u201d arrived last year. Soon after its release, \u201cInsano (Nitro Mega),\u201d a partner record that featured Wiz Khalifa, Pusha T, Steve Aoki and more, arrived.",
      "On May 9, Cudi released his latest single, \u201cNeverland.\u201d A short film of the same name, directed by Ti West and produced by Monkeypaw Productions, will premiere at Tribeca Film Festival this June.",
      "Also in May, Cudi officially launched his new apparel label, WZRD.",
      "Daring fashion has been a longtime passion for Cudi; the rapper has partnered with brands such as BAPE and Adidas. He collaborated with the late designer Virgil Abloh, and in 2021 channeled Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain by wearing an Abloh-designed Off-White floral dress on stage at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "Last week, he announced his engagement to menswear designer Lola Abecassis Sartore.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve been looking to watch this movie for years,\u201d Krasinski said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the movie I pretended to be in when I was a kid. This is what got me into the business.\u201d",
      "The film also stars Domnhall Gleeson as the wealthy businessman funding the operation and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez as one of the protectors of the Fountain of Youth.",
      "\u201c Guy Ritchie gets to work with some of the best cast in the world,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, who has now worked with him three times. \u201cThe biggest gift Guy has given me, besides the privilege of working with him, is working with them.\u201d",
      "Gleeson, a newcomer to the world of Ritchie, was pretty sure that it was going to be as enjoyable as it looked. And he got a vote of confidence from his director.",
      "\u201cGuy basically said, if you\u2019re not having fun, then this is not going to work and so the idea is to turn up and have fun,\u201d Gleeson said.",
      "There were a lot of things about \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d that piqued Portman\u2019s interest. The chance to work with Ritchie, Krasinski, and the rest of the cast, as well as the travel, but it also felt like something she could share with her own son and daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rare to get to make a movie that has this scale and this scope of adventure that you can watch with your kids,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for something that I can enjoy with my children.\u201d",
      "Her character, Charlotte, is an art historian who had an adventuresome childhood with her explorer father and brother Luke (Krasinski) but has since settled for a more stable life. We meet her amid a contentious divorce and custody battle over her 12-year-old son, and she\u2019s not exactly pleased when Luke steals a piece of art from her gallery and attempts to recruit her for the bigger mission. But soon, she\u2019s in scuba gear hunting down a lost Rembrandt in the wreckage of the RMS Lusitania.",
      "\u201cI think that something we search for as adults is how to regain that youthful spirit, how to hold onto that youthful energy and freedom and wildness, even when having to move into some adult responsibilities,\u201d said Portman, who, like her character is recently divorced. \u201cMaybe that can make you a better parent to have a little bit of that glint in your eye.\u201d",
      "She and Krasinski, working together for the first time, fell into the sibling dynamics easily.",
      "\u201cThese movies sort of live and die with the relationships,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cThe sibling thing really only works if you\u2019re having genuine fun with the person and it can come off screen. And I laughed with her every single day. She\u2019s so funny.\u201d",
      "Globe-trotting films aren\u2019t just travelogues for the audience, but their own sort of adventure for the cast and crew. This production earned their miles, skipping between the streets of Bangkok and Liverpool, the Austrian National Library in Vienna and Cairo to film at the great pyramids \u2014 where \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d became the first film of this scale to be granted the privilege to shoot action sequences there.",
      "\u201cIt was really a pinch me kind of moment to be like, oh, those are the pyramids and we\u2019re just hanging out here and walking into them and filming in them,\u201d Portman said.",
      "The big first was landing a Boeing Chinook CH47 helicopter in front of the Giza Plateau, and blowing up a jeep, all while the site remained open to tourists.",
      "\u201cWith any luck, we didn\u2019t blow it for Hollywood going back there for somebody else,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cBut if we did, at least we got to do it.\u201d",
      "Most of the big action moments \u201cinside\u201d the pyramids were saved for the safety of sets constructed at London\u2019s Leavesden Studio, where they also built the wreckage of the Lusitania in a water tank so big that it took two weeks to fill.",
      "\u201cFountain of Youth\u201d might seem like the type of movie that would be a natural fit for the big screen: A big budget, global adventure with major stars and sweeping vistas. While Krasinski champions movie theaters \u2014 at the time of the interview, he had a ticket to see \u201cSinners\u201d on IMAX the next day \u2014 he\u2019s also not feeling bittersweet that this one won\u2019t be playing at the multiplex. They all came into \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d knowing that it was a streaming-first endeavor.",
      "\u201cThis was always going to be a streaming movie, so I didn\u2019t really think about it in terms of ... Would people want to see it in theaters because it was just one of those things,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the new reality. There are definitely movies that are being made for streaming, and there are movies being made for theatrical.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt all depends on what the filmmaker\u2019s intent was, what the studio\u2019s intent and I think as long as those rules are laid out clearly in the beginning, I\u2019m down for either one.\u201d",

      "Some of Spike Lee\u2019s most deeply felt passions \u2014 filmmaking and the New York Knicks \u2014 have collided at the Cannes Film Festival",
      "CANNES, France -- There\u2019s no sufficient way of explaining what it\u2019s like to be around Spike Lee, but his new film, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d comes pretty close.",
      "The main character, played by Denzel Washington, is a Knicks fan who won\u2019t tolerate Celtics green in his house. A framed jersey of Jalen Brunson hangs in his Brooklyn apartment. There are movie references peppered throughout, of \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d and \u201cThe Sweet Smell of Success.\u201d Yankee Stadium plays a pivotal setting. In one scene, Nicholas Turturro even yells directly into the camera: \u201cBoston sucks!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not counting on Boston for box office!\u201d Lee says with a roaring cackle during an interview on a rooftop terrace in Cannes. \u201cWe might as well just write that off.\u201d",
      "Some of Lee\u2019s most deeply felt passions \u2014 filmmaking and the New York Knicks \u2014 have collided at the Cannes Film Festival. The premiere of \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a reimagining of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s \u201cHigh to Low,\u201d came shortly before the Knicks begin their Eastern Conference finals matchup with the Indiana Pacers. Everywhere Lee has gone at the French Riviera festival, he\u2019s gone in blue and orange, including a pinstripe suit on the red carpet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a film by a New Yorker who loves New York. But if you\u2019re not that, it doesn\u2019t detract from you enjoying it. You could be from \u2026 (Lee raises an eyebrow) \u2026 Indiana,\u201d Lee says before letting out a maniacal roar. \u201cWait a minute, we got to write off another market, too!\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d which A24 releases in theaters Aug. 22 before it streams on Apple TV+ on Sept. 5, was one of the most eventful premieres of Cannes. Washington was surprised with a Palme d\u2019Or. (\u201cThat wasn\u2019t acting,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know. Only three or four people knew.\u201d) Washington also got in an angry tangle with a photographer on the red carpet after his arm was grabbed.",
      "\u201cI wish I could\u2019ve told that photographer: \u2018Do not touch Denzel Washington or it\u2019s going to be a (expletive) problem,\u2019\u201d Lee says, laughing. \u201cThe headline, \u2018Man on Fire,\u2019 hoooooo! That was a good headline.\u201d",
      "Lee then picks up the digital recorder lying in front of him and says in a calm, professional voice: \u201cLadies and gentleman, this is a public service announcement. Do not put your hands on Mr. Denzel Washington. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. Thank you very much.\u201d",
      "But Lee, 68, has been more than happy to mix it up in Cannes. Before an interview, he taunted European journalists about his adopted Premier League team, Arsenal. At the press conference earlier in the day, he quoted Yoda for his primary message to film students: \u201cThere is no try, only do.\u201d Said Lee: \u201cAre you faking the funk or are you serious?\u201d",
      "Lee, who last debuted 2018\u2019s \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d in Cannes, tried to avoid saying anything too pointed about President Donald Trump. But couldn\u2019t help himself when asked about the moral decisions that mark \u201cHighest 2 Lowest.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how much we can talk about American values considering who is president,\u201d Lee told reporters.",
      "Lee was also on an apology tour at the festival. Four years ago, he was the head of the jury that awarded Julia Ducournau\u2019s \u201cTitane\u201d the Palme d\u2019Or. Only Lee, confused by the French-language ceremony, accidentally revealed the winner too soon. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a big one,\u201d said Lee, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s going down in the history of Cannes.\u201d",
      "Just ahead of Lee's interview with The Associated Press, Ducournau, in Cannes with her \u201cTitane\u201d follow-up, \u201cAlpha,\u201d crossed the terrace to warmly embrace him. Recalling \u201cTitane,\u201d Lee said, \u201cA car impregnates a woman? You gotta win. You got my vote.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d has been referred to as a remake of \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d but the degree to which it\u2019s a Spike Lee joint surprised festivalgoers. Washington plays David King, a wealthy record label executive whose son, along with the son of his friend and driver (Jeffrey Wright), is kidnapped for ransom. The kidnapper, played by A$AP Rocky, accidentally releases the wrong young man, leaving King with the decision to fork over the $17.5 million ransom for a young man who\u2019s not his son.",
      "The film is, in part, an ode to Kurosawa, whom Lee discovered as a film student at NYU. He credits his \u201cRashomon\u201d as the basis of \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d He met Kurosawa briefly once and has an autograph from the Japanese master signed with a paint brush. \u201cI got to shake his hand,\u201d says Lee.",
      "\u201cI grew up with my mother taking me to musicals,\" he says. \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d was one. If you listen to that great song by Rogers and Hammerstein with Julie Andrews singing it. What did Coltrane do to it? That\u2019s my analogy. What Coltrane did to \u2018My Favorite Things,\u2019 I think that\u2019s what we did with this.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is less driven as a Kurosawa homage than by Lee\u2019s own obsessions: New York, music, the moral dilemmas of a Black entertainer and, yes, that Boston sucks. Above all, it\u2019s another Lee protagonist forced to do the right thing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad you said that. I never thought about that connected to the decisions David King has to make,\u201d Lee says. \u201cBut what you see is the turmoil he\u2019s going through. He\u2019s going through it. A moral decision. Money on one hand, a life on the other.\u201d",
      "More than any recent film of his, you can sense Lee having fun. Back in New York. Back with Denzel. \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is Lee and Washington\u2019s fifth film together but the first in 19 years after 2006\u2019s \u201cInside Man.\u201d \"It\u2019s not like we had to catch up,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWe never lost a step.\u201d",
      "But Lee suspects \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d marks the end of their collaboration \u2014 one of cinema\u2019s greatest actor-director pairings, spanning \u201cMo\u2019 Better Blues,\u201d \u201cMalcolm X\u201d and \u201cHe Got Game.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what he says,\u201d Lee shrugs, citing Washington\u2019s retirement plans. \u201cAnd then the other day he\u2019s doing a film with the guy from \u2018City of God,\u2019 so. Denzel put that on himself: \u2018I\u2019m doing this thing and then I\u2019m retiring.\u2019 I\u2019ll believe it when he hangs it up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d reaches a blistering crescendo when King confronts Rocky\u2019s kidnapper in a basement recording studio. A kind of rap battle ensues that Lee gives much of the credit to Washington for. The actor improvised many of his lyrics, drawing heavily from Nas. (\"That was not scripted,\" says Lee. \u201cWe had to pay for that!\u201d)",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand. Denzel is such a powerful force. Not a derogatory term, but he\u2019s a beast. If you got somebody who don\u2019t got it, Denzel is going to slaughter them. SLAUGHTER,\" Lee explains. \u201cRocky is from Harlem, uptown. So I knew that he\u2019s not going to punk out. He\u2019s going to stand there, feet planted to the ground, as a heavyweight fight, blow to blow to blow.\u201d",
      "For Lee, the scene is a summation of what he loves about moviemaking and what delights him so much courtside at Madison Square Garden.",
      "\u201cPeople want to see a championship fight, and that\u2019s what it is. That is, in boxing terms, a slugfest,\u201d says Lee. \u201dThat makes great cinema. It makes great sports. You\u2019ve got conflict. It\u2019s a battle, and they\u2019re slugging it out.\u201d",

      "A prosecutor said at the end of Tuesday's court session that Mescudi will be the third witness after a federal agent finishes testifying about what investigators found last year when they raided Combs\u2019 home in Florida.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his fame and fortune to oversee a two-decade-long racketeering enterprise that controlled Cassie and others through threats and violence.",
      "His lawyers say evidence in the case reflects domestic violence, not anything amounting to a criminal racket or sex trafficking.",
      "Cassie testified last week that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi several times in 2011 to work on music. She said her relationship with Cudi began late in the year and she got a burner phone so the two could communicate without Combs learning about it.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in so-called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d that involved sexual performances with male escorts that Combs watched and sometimes participated in. It was during one of those \u201cfreak-offs\u201d that Combs picked up her regular phone and noticed communications that revealed Cassie was seeing Cudi, Cassie said.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie's mother, Regina Ventura, testified that she received an email in December 2011 from Cassie saying that Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Afterward, Regina Ventura said, she received a demand from Combs for $20,000. Scared for her daughter's safety, she went to the bank and sent Combs the money, only to have it returned by Combs days later.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother's Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and stayed for three or four days. She said she broke up with him.",
      "\u201cIt was just too much,\u201d she said. \u201cToo much danger, too much uncertainty of, like, what could happen if we continued to see each other.\u201d",
      "Cassie said she told her family she was going to Los Angeles after the holidays to \u201cget to work.\u201d But instead, she said, she traveled after New Year's to meet Combs in Arizona, where he had gone to visit a college with his son. They resumed their relationship.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country, Combs told her that Cudi's car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi's friends there to see it, Cassie said.",

      "PARIS -- Police have found a bust of Jim Morrison that was stolen nearly four decades ago from the Paris grave that has long been a place of pilgrimage for fans of the legendary Doors singer and poet.",
      "The bust taken in 1988 from P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery was found during an unrelated investigation conducted by a financial anti-corruption unit, Paris police said in an Instagram post Monday.",
      "There was no immediate word on whether the bust would be returned to the grave or what other investigation might take place.",
      "Morrison, the singer of Doors classics including \u201cLight My Fire,\u201d \u201cBreak on Through,\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d was found dead in a Paris bathtub at age 27 in 1971.",
      "He was buried at P\u00e8re-Lachaise, the city's cemetery that is the final resting place of scores of artists, writers and other cultural luminaries including Marcel Proust, Oscar Wilde, Gertrude Stein and Edith Piaf.",
      "The 300-pound bust made by Croatian sculptor Mladen Mikulin was added to the grave in 1981 for the 10th anniversary of the singer's death.",
      "\u201cI think it would be incredible if they put the bust back onto where it was and it would attract so many more people, but the cemetery wouldn\u2019t even be able to hold that many people,\u201d Paris tour guide Jade Jezzini told The Associated Press. \u201cThe amount of people who would rush in here just to see the bust to take pictures of it, it would be incredible.\u201d",
      "Known for his dark lyrics, wavy locks, leather pants, theatrical stage presence and mystical manner, Morrison has inspired generations of acolytes who congregate at his grave to reflect and sometimes to party, including a major gathering for the 50th anniversary of his death. The site has often been covered with flowers, poetic graffiti and liquor bottles left in tribute.",
      "He was undergoing a cultural renaissance when the bust was stolen in the late 1980s, which peaked with the 1991 Oliver Stone film \u201cThe Doors,\u201d in which Val Kilmer, who died in April, played Morrison.",
      "London artist Sam Burcher recently returned to the now more subdued grave site that she first visited 40 years ago when the sculpture of Morrison was still in place.",
      "\u201cThe bust was much smaller than all of these grand tombs. It was very modest, so I was quite surprised by that,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cBut the other thing was the atmosphere, it was buzzing. There were people partying, smoking, music, dancing, and then I brought strawberries and kind of gave them out to everyone ... it was just such an amazing experience.\u201d",
      "Morrison cofounded the Doors in Los Angeles in 1965 with Ray Manzarek. Robby Krieger and John Densmore joined soon after.",
      "The band and its frontman burned brightly but briefly, releasing albums including \u201cThe Doors\u201d \u201cStrange Days,\" and \u201cMorrison Hotel, whose The California site that gave that album its name and cover image was seriously damaged in a fire last year.",
      "After their final album, 1971\u2019s \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d Morrison moved to Paris. His cause of death was listed as heart failure, though no autopsy was performed as none was required by law. Disputes and myths have surrounded the death and added to his mystique.",

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed Tuesday to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet, accusing it of promoting a news agenda with a liberal bias.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty started broadcasting during the Cold War. Its programs are aired in 27 languages in 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East. Its lawyers have been fighting the administration in court.",

      "She said that she hoped the 27 EU member countries would also provide more funds to help Radio Free Europe longer term. Kallas said the bloc has been looking for \u201cstrategic areas\u201d where it can help as the United States cuts foreign aid.",

      "They have some similarities, Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump \u2014 guys in their 70s with homes in New Jersey and big constituencies among white American men middle-aged and older. And both, in very different respects, are the boss.",
      "That's about where it ends.",
      "The veteran rock star, long a political opponent of the president, stood up as one of Trump's most prominent cultural critics last week with a verbal takedown from a British stage.",
      "As is his nature, Trump is fighting back \u2014 hard. He calls Springsteen a \u201cdried out prune of a rocker\u201d and is even bringing Beyonc\u00e9 into the fray.",
      "On Monday, the president suggested Springsteen and Beyonc\u00e9 should be investigated to see if appearances they made on behalf of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, last fall represented an illegal campaign donation.",
      "Opening a tour in Manchester, England, Springsteen told his audience last Thursday that \u201cthe America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cTonight we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring.\"",
      "Springsteen later made reference to an \u201cunfit president and a rogue government\u201d who have \u201cno concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.\u201d",
      "The next morning, Trump called Springsteen highly overrated. \u201cNever liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy \u2014 just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cThis dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country,\u201d he said.",
      "The next night, also in Manchester, Springsteen repeated his criticisms.",
      "\u201cIt's no surprise what Springsteen's political leanings are and have been for many decades,\u201d said veteran music writer Alan Light, author of the upcoming \u201cDon't Stop: Why We (Still) Love Fleetwood Mac's Rumours.\u201d \u201cHe's somebody who has been outspoken in his music and his actions.\u201d",
      "The Boss' statements this week showed he wasn't afraid to speak out \u201cat a time when so many people and institutions are just kind of rolling over,\u201d Light said.",
      "It's not the first time Springsteen has spoken out against Trump \u2014 or a Republican president.",
      "When former President Ronald Reagan referenced Springsteen's \u201cmessage of hope\u201d at a campaign stop during the height of the rocker's \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d popularity, Springsteen wondered if Reagan had listened to his music and its references to those left behind in the 1980s economy. He also has had an occasionally bumpy relationship with onetime Republican presidential candidate and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a fan of his music.",
      "Springsteen has campaigned for Trump's opponents, including Harris last fall. In 2020, he said that \u201ca good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotized, brainwashed by a con man from Queens.\u201d",
      "He knows the outer-borough reference still stung a man who built his own tower in Manhattan and ascended to the presidency. Trump often stays at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Springsteen grew up in New Jersey \u2014 you may have heard \u2014 and lives in Colts Neck, New Jersey, now.",
      "Trump doesn't hesitate to go after the biggest musical names that speak out against him, like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. But the political risk may be less; their younger, more female audiences are less likely to intersect with Trump's core constituency.",
      "During his career, Springsteen has challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements. The 1995 album \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants \u2014 Mexican and Vietnamese among them. And his 2001 song \u201cAmerican Skin (41 Shots),\" criticized the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fan base.",
      "Clearly, Springsteen has conservative fans and some who wish he'd steer clear of politics, Light said. Still, \u201c40 years later, it's hard to imagine what they think would happen\u201d with Trump, he said.",
      "While Trump made a point to reference Springsteen's criticism in an overseas show, he and the E Street Band haven't performed in the United States since before the 2024 election. His tour last year hit heavily on themes of mortality, less of politics. He has several European tour dates scheduled this year into July and hasn't announced any new American shows.",

      "\u201cThis is a total surprise for me,\u201d said Washington.",
      "The festival usually gives out one or two honorary Palmes each edition \u2014 last year, the awardees were Studio Ghibli and George Lucas. Last week, Robert De Niro received one on the festival's opening night. De Niro's award was announced in advance, but surprise prizes aren't unheard of: In 2022, Tom Cruise was presented with a surprise honorary Palme d'Or just before the screening of \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d",
      "The premiere also had another surprise: Rihanna attended and walked the carpet afterward with partner A$AP Rocky. Earlier this month, she revealed at the Met Gala that she was pregnant with their third child.",
      "While the festival's photo calls usually happen the day after a film's premiere, Cannes hosted one for \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d earlier Monday so Washington could attend. The actor, playfully posing with Lee and co-star A$AP Rocky, showed no signs of jet lag and left once the screening began.",
      "\u201cHe told me to tell you: Thank you for the love,\u201d Lee told the crowd after the screening. \u201cHe's on Broadway doing \u2018Othello,\u2019 so it really took a lot for him to fly here. Let's give it up for Denzel Washington, please.\u201d",
      "Lee also came to Cannes with obligations back in New York on his mind. He arrived at the film\u2019s premiere decked out in Knicks colors and wearing a blue and orange striped suit. Lee ended his brief speech in the Palais by hollering: \u201cNew York Knicks!\u201d",
      "That Washington would be able to make the trip had been a sticking point for Cannes. When the festival first announced its lineup last month, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d wasn't included. Within hours, however, Lee himself announced the film was heading to Cannes. Representatives for the festival said they had been waiting for confirmation that Washington would attend to walk the red carpet.",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 film \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d will be released in theaters by A24 on Aug. 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ on Sept. 5.",

      "Gary Lineker, the former England soccer player and now a media celebrity, will step down from his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat",
      "Gary Lineker, the England soccer great-turned-media celebrity, will leave his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat.",
      "The 64-year-old Lineker, who is the British national broadcaster\u2019s highest-paid presenter on about 1.3 million pounds ($1.7 million) a year, was set to leave flagship soccer highlights show \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d at the end of this season but remain with the BBC to front other soccer coverage, including next year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup.",
      "However, the BBC said Monday in a statement that Lineker will step down entirely from the corporation after the final \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d episode next weekend in the wake of his decision to share a post from the group, Palestine Lobby, illustrated with a picture of a rat, titled: \u201cZionism explained in two minutes.\u201d",
      "Rats, linked to disease and dirt, have been used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda throughout history, including by the Nazis in 1930s Germany.",
      "\u201cGary has acknowledged the mistake he made,\u201d BBC director-general Tim Davie said. \u201cAccordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season.\u201d",
      "Lineker had already apologized for his conduct, saying last week he reposted material which he subsequently learned contained \u201coffensive references,\u201d adding that he withdrew the post as soon as he became aware of the issue and \u201cwould never knowingly share anything antisemitic.\u201d",
      "Before Lineker\u2019s apology, Davie said the corporation needed people to be the \u201cexemplars of BBC values and follow our social media policies\u201d and that \u201cwhen someone makes a mistake, it costs us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFootball has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember \u2014 both on the pitch and in the studio,\u201d Lineker said in the BBC statement. \u201cI care deeply about the game, and about the work I\u2019ve done with the BBC over many years. As I\u2019ve said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic \u2014 it goes against everything I stand for.",
      "\u201cHowever, I recognize the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\u201d",
      "In a separate video post on Instagram, Lineker said he had made a \u201cgenuine mistake\u201d and \u201cshould have been more diligent.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have stood up for minorities and humanitarian issues and all forms of racism all of my life, including of course antisemitism, which I absolutely abhor,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for it, and never should be.\u201d",
      "Lineker\u2019s openness to reflect his political views on social media have caused growing friction with the BBC regarding its impartiality guidelines.",
      "He was temporarily suspended from the corporation in March 2023 over comments he made criticizing the then-Conservative government\u2019s new asylum policy. It led to the BBC\u2019s rules on social media posts being rewritten to say presenters of high-profile programs outside news had a \u201cresponsibility to respect the BBC\u2019s impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC.\u201d",
      "Lineker was among 500 high-profile figures who signed an open letter in February urging the BBC to re-broadcast a documentary, \u201cGaza: How to Survive a War Zone,\u201d to its streaming service, BBC iPlayer. The documentary was pulled after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Last week, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph newspaper that came a day after his initial apology, Lineker spoke out about the conduct of Israel in the war against Hamas in Gaza, saying those who stayed silent about it were \u201calmost complicit.\u201d",
      "The BBC has lost something of a national treasure who has become almost as well known a broadcaster as he was a soccer player.",
      "Lineker is one of England\u2019s greatest players \u2014 he scored 48 goals in 80 games for his country and was the leading scorer at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico \u2014 who transitioned into being a slick, witty and knowledgeable TV personality and an all-around media darling, with 8.7 million followers on X and 1.2 million followers on Instagram. He has been the main presenter of BBC\u2019s \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d since 1999 and used his status as a freelancer to work for other broadcasters such as NBC, Al Jazeera and BT Sport.",
      "Lineker, who played his club soccer for Everton, Tottenham and Barcelona, is the co-founder of the hugely successful \u201cGoalhanger\u201d podcasts \u2014 the maker of the popular \u201cThe Rest is History\u201d series and its spin-offs about politics, soccer, entertainment and money.",
      "Lineker\u2019s departure from the BBC was welcomed by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which said he had become \u201ca symbol of the rot at the heart of our national broadcaster.\u201d",
      "Lineker, the group added, was \u201crepeatedly allowed to flout the BBC\u2019s own rules on impartiality, abusing his position to promote his increasingly propagandist politics, vilifying those he disagrees with, and even promoting dehumanizing and extreme messages.\u201d",
      "Lineker has accepted that being outspoken with his views would make him a target but, for many, it has strengthened his status as one of Britain\u2019s most popular figures.",
      "\u201cGary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades,\u201d Davie said. \u201cHis passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.\u201d",
      "\u201cMatch of the Day\u201d \u2014 a late-night program that has been running since the 1960s and is regarded as an institution in Britain \u2014 will be hosted by Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan for the start of the 2025-26 season. None of them are former soccer players.",

      "President Donald Trump promised a review within 100 days that would analyze the ramifications that U.S. lifestyle \u2014 from the medications prescribed for children to the food served on their school lunch trays \u2014 has on childhood diseases like obesity, depression or attention deficit disorder. The report, led by a so-called \u201cMAHA Commission,\u201d is expected to be released on Thursday.",
      "Farmers and Republicans are nervous about what the report might say about glyphosate, the ingredient commonly used in pesticides sprayed on crops. Kennedy has denied the report will be unfavorable to farmers.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley warned that farmers have reached out to him, upset they have not been able to provide input on the MAHA report ahead of its release.",
      "\u201cI hope there is nothing in the MAHA report that jeopardizes the food supply or the livelihood of farmers,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "Last month, a group of 79 Republicans \u2014 including several senators who represent farming states \u2014 echoed similar concerns about the report saying in a letter to Kennedy that without the products agricultural \u201cyields and quantity are negatively impacted.\u201d",
      "Glyphosate has been available for about 50 years and some farmers say it remains essential for controlling weeds without excessive tilling, helping to conserve both soil and fuel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we still use: It works,\u201d said Blake Hurst, a Missouri farmer who is past president of the Missouri Farm Bureau.",
      "Kennedy, though, has built a sizable following over many decades, in part, because of the lawsuits he's waged against corporations, including the company that produced weedkiller Roundup. The World Health Organization has labeled that product's key ingredient, glyphosate, as a probable carcinogen for humans.",

      "During a senate hearing on Wednesday, Kennedy rebutted concerns from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith that the report would \u201cunfairly\u201d target farmers.",
      "\u201cThere's not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,\u201d Kennedy said of his report. \u201cWe are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\u201d",
      "Kennedy was appearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee to discuss the White House's proposed budget, which would give a $500 million boost for Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. That same proposal also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and medical research programs.",
      "In February, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Make America Healthy Again Commission tasked with examining the \u201cthreat\u201d that prescription drugs, chemicals and certain food ingredients pose to children.",

The largest outbreak in the U.S. has been in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. There are also large outbreaks in Mexico and Canada.",
      "It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world\u2019s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.",
      "\u201cOn average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,\u201d said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few viruses that even come close to that.\u201d",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "People who have had measles once can\u2019t get it again, health officials say.",
      "It usually doesn\u2019t kill people, but it can.",
      "Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.",
      "Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis \u2014 which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.",
      "\u201cChildren develop the most severe illness,\" said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.\u201d",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cBefore a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got\u201d measles, Weaver said. There is \u201cgreat data\u201d on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.",
      "\u201cAny of these outbreaks we\u2019re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we\u2019re not going to see this happening in the future. And we\u2019ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.\u201d",
      "Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Not usually. People who are vaccinated are considered protected against measles for their lifetime.",
      "Health care providers can test for antibodies and give boosters if needed.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\u201d",
      "Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",

      "Emotional well-being",
      "NEW YORK -- Marian Rivman is pushing 80. Harriet Luria is a proud 83. In this trio, Carol Leister is the baby at 62. Together, they have decades of experience with yoga. Only now, it involves a chair.",
      "Chair yoga adapts traditional yoga poses for older people and others with physical challenges, but the three devotees said after a recent class that doesn't mean it's not a quality workout. As older adults have become more active, chair yoga has grown in popularity.",
      "\u201cYou're stretching your whole body,\u201d Rivman offered. \u201cWhat you can do in the chair is a little bit more forgiving on the knees and on the hips. So as you age, it allows you to get into positions that you were doing before without hurting yourself.\u201d",
      "Sitting down to exercise, or standing while holding onto a chair to perform some poses, may not sound like a workout, but Rivman, Luria, Leister and practitioners everywhere see a world of benefits.",
      "\u201cI took it up because I have osteoporosis and the chair yoga is much easier,\u201d Luria said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry as much about falling and breaking anything. It's not as difficult as I thought it would be, but it\u2019s not easy. And you really do use your muscles. It\u2019s an excellent workout.\u201d",
      "Chair yoga is clearly marketed to older women, who made up the class where the three yoga friends got together at the Marlene Meyerson JCC on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But the practice also has a lot to offer others, said their instructor, Whitney Chapman.",
      "Desk workers can squeeze in 15 minutes of chair yoga, for instance. Many companies offer it as a way to cut down on stress and improve overall health. And people recovering from surgery or injuries may not be ready to get down on a yoga mat, but they can stretch in a chair.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known these ladies probably 18 to 20 years. And the very first time in a yoga class that I brought in the chair, all of my students said I don\u2019t want geriatric yoga. I\u2019m not an old person,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "\u201cAnd then they saw that having a chair is just as good as a yoga strap, a yoga block. It\u2019s another prop that\u2019s going to help you do what you want to do. So it\u2019s not necessarily because you\u2019re older, but that it can be helpful. And it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re geriatric just because you\u2019re sitting in a chair.\u201d",
      "The benefits are many, Chapman said: improved flexibility, strength, balance. And there's the overall emotional well-being that yoga practitioners in general report. It's particularly useful for people with mobility issues or chronic ailments like arthritis or back pain. Chapman also teaches yoga to cancer and Parkinson's disease patients.",
      "In addition to restorative and other benefits, the practice of chair yoga can help improve posture for people of all ages and abilities, and help older people prevent falls.",
      "Leister recently retired.",
      "\u201cI've been looking for all different kinds of exercises to do and this is one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one that I could see doing for the rest of my life, where some that are a little more strenuous I may not be able to do in the future.\u201d",
      "Traditional yoga originated more than 5,000 years ago in India. Many of the poses used today are also that old. It can be as much spiritual as physical, and that also goes for its chair descendant. The precise movements are tied to deliberate, cleansing breathwork.",
      "Rivman has been doing yoga for about 50 years.",
      "\u201cOnce you start and you get what it does for your body, you don\u2019t want to give it up. And if there\u2019s a way that you can keep doing it and keep doing it safely, that\u2019s a choice you\u2019re going to make,\u201d she said.",
      "The practice of yoga, including chair yoga, has been on the rise in the U.S. over the last 20 years. In 2022, the percentage of adults age 18 and older who practiced yoga in the past 12 months was 16.9%, with percentages highest among women ages 18\u201344, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Women are more than twice as likely as men to practice yoga, the data showed. The percentage of adults who practiced yoga to treat or manage pain decreased with increasing family income.",
      "The CDC, didn't break out chair yoga for analysis but recommends that adults 65 and older focus on activities that improve balance and strength. That, the health agency said, can be achieved through various exercises, including chair yoga.",
      "Chapman and her students have thoughts on why more men don\u2019t practice yoga. Traditionally, Chapman said, the practice was reserved for men, but as yoga became more westernized, women took over.",
      "\u201cWomen tend to be more group-oriented. I would love to see more men in class. I do have a few. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re intimidated, but you know, it\u2019s a great way to meet women if everybody\u2019s single,\u201d Chapman said with a chuckle.",
      "Luria theorizes that fewer men are drawn to yoga because it's not a competitive sport.",
      "\u201cYou're really working at your own level,\u201d she said. \u201cTake out the competition and it's not their thing.\u201d",
      "These chair yoga practitioners have lots of advice. Rivman summed it up best: \u201cGet into a chair and do some yoga. You don't have to stand on your head, but you have to move. You're never too old to start.\"",

      "Some studies have shown that children with autism are more at risk of drowning",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In an airy indoor pool with fish cutouts on the walls, a group of small children bobbed, floated and tentatively flutter-kicked.",
      "It was what it looked like, a starter swimming class. But here, instructors worked one-on-one or even two to a child. Some held cards to help kids communicate with teachers by pointing instead of speaking. No one blew whistles.",
      "All the students in the class at the Small Fish Big Fish swim school had autism, a developmental disorder linked to a higher-than-average danger of drowning.",
      "It has long worried autism experts and parents, but recent data make the stakes starkly clear. In Florida, a state where water abounds from beaches to backyards, over 100 children who had autism or were being evaluated for it have drowned since the start of 2021, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County.",
      "The numbers highlight an oft-overlooked dilemma: Autism makes swimming instruction all the more necessary but, often, all the more difficult to get.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for kids with autism,\u201d said Lovely Chrisostome, who was terrified this winter when her 6-year-old son slipped out of the family\u2019s home and wandered through their lake-dotted neighborhood. She\u2019d once tried enrolling him in swim classes at a public pool, but he had refused to go in.",
      "But her son was in the pool at the autism-specific class at Small Fish Big Fish. An instructor helped him float on his back. When he started showing discomfort \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like to get his head wet \u2013 she eased him onto his side, where he seemed content.",
      "Autism affects an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children. Their water safety has gotten occasional public attention after tragedies such as the death of Avonte Oquendo, an autistic teen who was found in a New York river in 2014 after disappearing from his school.",
      "While academic research on the issue is limited, a pair of 2017 studies documented a substantially heightened risk of drowning among people with autism spectrum disorder. The risk stems in large part from their propensity to wander off and to underappreciate perils, according to co-author Dr. Guohua Li and other experts.",
      "One Florida 5-year-old apparently wriggled out a doggy door and got into his grandmother\u2019s pool. Another died in a canal after slipping through a fence hole at a playground specifically intended for autistic kids. A 6-year-old drowned in a lake after she evidently climbed a bookshelf positioned to block an apartment door, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County. It\u2019s now building a national database.",
      "\u201cSwimming lessons should be a first-line treatment for autism,\u201d said Li, a Columbia University epidemiology professor who isn't involved in the council's research. Li himself has a son with the condition.",
      "Some autistic people excel at swimming, such as the New Jersey teens featured in the 2017 documentary \u201cSwim Team.\" Many others are adept in water. Even some profoundly autistic children can master survival basics with as little as eight hours of aquatic occupational therapy, said Michele Alaniz, a practitioner who published research based on her work at Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare in Pomona, California.",
      "But some families don't sign up for classes, fearing they'll overwhelm children who might have symptoms ranging from not speaking to repeatedly banging their heads to becoming distressed by noise. Other youngsters get kicked out of programs that can\u2019t handle them. Private sessions can be helpful, but pricey.",
      "\u201cHaving somebody that understands a child on the spectrum \u2014 what the special needs are, how to communicate with a child, how to also mitigate a meltdown, particularly in a pool \u2014 is so vital,\u201d says Lindsey Corey. She said her 5-year-old son didn't absorb much from a general swim class or from private lessons at home in Lake Worth, Florida, but made progress in a program with instructors trained by the Autism Society.",
      "As drowning risks have come into focus, advocates are trying to make swimming lessons more accessible. An Australian charity called Autism Swim says 1,400 swim teachers, physical therapists and others worldwide have taken its online training since 2016.",
      "In Florida, the Children's Services Council's of Palm Beach County provided $17,000 last year for the Autism Society of America to train dozens of instructors, said Jon Burstein, who did the council's research on autism and drowning. The organization paid another $13,500 for the classes at Small Fish Big Fish.",
      "The dozen students, ranging from about 4 to 8, attend a nearby autism-specific charter school. They initially were reluctant to get in the bus, let alone in the water, organizers said. But on an early April afternoon, they readily headed for the shallow pool.",
      "One girl floated on a foam board with her face in the water, an exercise in breath control. Another girl grinned as she propelled herself on a foam noodle.",
      "\u201cShe's fearless to the point it's scary because she'll just jump into a pool, whether she can swim or not,\u201d her mother, Jana D'Agostino, said later. \u201cSo this is really important. It's saving their lives.\u201d",
      "Across the pool, a boy reluctantly eased himself from the steps into the water, where Small Fish founder Melissa Taylor waited for him. \u201cMy turn!\u201d she said, and dunked her head in the water.",
      "He did likewise, then retreated to the steps. Taylor continued working with him, but he soon backed out of the pool and began making hand movements. Realizing he'd had enough, instructors let him towel off.",
      "\u201cIt's taking a lot to get him to trust us,\u201d explained Taylor. But she also recognizes when repetitive splashing and movement signal excitement, not alarm.",
      "The session continued for the other children, including Chrisostome's son, who emerged with a smile.",
      "He has learned a lot in the lessons, but what struck her most?",
      "\u201cThe happiness that he has.\"",

      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Annual COVID-19 shots for healthy younger adults and children will no longer be routinely approved under a major new policy shift unveiled Tuesday by the Trump administration.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new requirements for access to yearly COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach that would continue offering them to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.",
      "But the FDA framework urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. In a framework published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials said the approach still could keep annual vaccinations available for between 100 million and 200 million people.",
      "The upcoming changes raise questions for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The framework is the culmination of a series of recent stepsscrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising major questions about the broader availability of vaccines under President Donald Trump. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under the Trump administration.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, which make the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines, didn't immediately comment.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots when manufacturers provide evidence that they spark just as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, particularly their recommendation for young, healthy adults and children. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s update, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and states that the U.S. has been \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d in recommending COVID boosters, when compared with European countries.",
      "\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Makary and Prasad recommended that companies study people not deemed at high risk for six months, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death.",
      "Experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended for people at increased risk.",
      "An influential panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "The creator of the Dilbert comic strip, which was canceled by most newspapers two years ago over the creator\u2019s racist comments, said Monday that he has been diagnosed with the same aggressive prostate cancer as former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI have the same cancer that Joe Biden has,\u201d Scott Adams said Monday during an episode of his YouTube show, \u201cReal Coffee with Scott Adams. \u201cSo, I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.\u201d",
      "He made the announcement after extending his \u201crespect and compassion and sympathy\u201d for Biden and his family. Biden announced his diagnosis on Sunday and said he and his family were reviewing treatment options with his doctors.",
      "Adams, 67, said he's always in pain, uses a walker to get around and that he expects to die sometime this summer.",
      "\u201cIt's basically intolerable,\u201d he said of the pain.",
      "Adams said he has had time to process his diagnosis and that it has given him time to say goodbyes, get his affairs in order and do all the things he needed to do.",
      "Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers but disappeared with lightning speed in 2023 following racist remarks by Adams.",
      "On his YouTube show at the time, among other things, he described Black people as a \u201chate group\u201d and said he would no longer \u201chelp Black Americans.\u201d",
      "He later said he was being hyperbolic, yet continued to defend his stance.",
      "Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work.",
      "The editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, which dumped \u201cDilbert\u201d in 2022, said the comic strip \u201cwent from being hilarious to being hurtful and mean.\u201d",

      "Nebraska is the first state to receive a federal waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks under the benefit program for low-income Americans long known as food stamps.",
      "The move, announced Monday by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, would affect about 152,000 people in Nebraska enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps families pay for groceries.",
      "\u201cThere's absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,\u201d Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement. \u201cSNAP is about helping families in need get healthy food into their diets, but there's nothing nutritious about the junk we're removing with today's waiver.\u201d",
      "Six other states \u2014 Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Indiana, Iowa and West Virginia \u2014 have also submitted requests for waivers banning certain foods and drinks or, in some cases, expanding access to hot foods for participants, according to the USDA.",

      "Rollins called Monday's move \u201ca historic step to Make America Healthy again.\u201d",
      "Details of Nebraska's waiver, which takes effect Jan. 1, weren't immediately available. Anti-hunger advocates criticized it, saying it adds costs, boosts administrative burdens and increases stigma for people already facing food insecurity.",
      "The waiver \u201cignores decades of evidence showing that incentive-based approaches \u2014 not punitive restrictions \u2014 are the most effective, dignified path to improving nutrition and reducing hunger,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "SNAP is a roughly $100 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans and is run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and administered through states.",

      "Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for everything from bottled water and soda to chips, ice cream and \u201cluxury meats\u201d like steak.",
      "Until now, USDA rejected the waivers, saying there were no clear standards to define certain foods as good or bad. In addition, the agency had said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly, and would not necessarily change recipients' food purchases or reduce health problems such as obesity.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Investigators on Monday were combing through the writings of a 25-year-old man believed responsible for an explosion that ripped through a Southern California fertility clinic over the weekend.",
      "The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation Saturday that damaged the American Reproductive Centers building in Palm Springs, east of Los Angeles. Bartkus died in the explosion. None of the facility's embryos were damaged.",
      "Authorities called the attack terrorism and said Bartkus left behind nihilistic writings that indicated views against procreation, an idea known as anti-natalism.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The blast gutted the clinic and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Passersby described a loud boom, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along sidewalks of the upscale desert city.",
      "Bartkus' body was found near a charred vehicle.",
      "Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office, called it possibly the \u201clargest bombing scene that we\u2019ve had in Southern California.\u201d",
      "The facility was closed for the day.",
      "\u201cThis was a targeted attack against the IVF facility,\u201d Davis said Sunday. \u201cMake no mistake: We are treating this, as I said yesterday, as an intentional act of terrorism.\u201d",
      "Authorities executed a search warrant in Bartkus' hometown of Twentynine Palms, a city of 28,000 residents northeast of Palm Springs with a large U.S. Marine Corps base.",
      "Bartkus tried to livestream the explosion, but the attempt failed, the FBI said.",
      "Authorities haven't shared specifics about the explosives used to make the bomb and where Bartkus may have obtained them.",
      "Scott Sweetow, a retired ATF explosives expert, said the amount of damage caused indicated that the suspect used a \u201chigh explosive\u201d similar to dynamite and TNT rather than a \u201clow explosive\u201d like gun powder.",
      "Those types of explosives are normally difficult for civilians to access, but increasingly people are finding ways to concoct explosives at home, he said.",
      "\u201cOnce you know the chemistry involved, it\u2019s pretty easy to get stuff,\u201d Sweetow said. \u201cThe ingredients you could get at a grocery store.\u201d",
      "The images of the aftermath also showed that the explosion appeared to blow from the street straight through the building and to the parking lot on the other side, something that could have been intentional or pure luck, Sweetow said. A part of the car was also blown through the building and landed in the back by a dumpster.",
      "Authorities are working to learn more about Bartkus\u2019 motives. They haven\u2019t said if he intended to kill himself in the attack or why he chose the specific facility.",
      "His writings communicated \u201cnihilistic ideations\u201d that were still being examined to determine his state of mind, said U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in the area. In general, nihilism suggests that life is meaningless.",
      "He appeared to hold anti-natalist views, which include a belief that it is morally wrong for people to bring children into the world. The clinic he attacked provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.",
      "Some people with extreme anti-procreation views have a lack of purpose and a bleak feeling about their own lives \u201cand they diagnose society as suffering in a similar way that they are,\u201d said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. \u201cEssentially, they feel like we're all doomed, that it's all hopeless.\u201d",
      "That hopelessness is a way for attackers to rationalize their violent actions, Lankford said Monday.",

      "The announcement that Joe Biden has prostate cancer is the latest example of how the final chapters of his political career have been shaped by the disease",
      "WASHINGTON -- In Joe Biden\u2019s family, there\u2019s a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are \u201cyou have cancer.\u201d",
      "One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.",
      "Now it is the former president\u2019s turn. Biden\u2019s office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.",
      "Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden\u2019s life could be what ends it.",
      "\u201cCancer touches us all,\u201d Biden wrote on social media. \u201cLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.\u201d",
      "Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection. As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.",
      "Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.",
      "Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to \u201cchannel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better\u201d on treating cancer to \"make sure that other people didn\u2019t have to go through what he went through.\u201d",
      "The effort was formalized as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.",
      "\u201cBeau should be the one running for president, not me,\u201d Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.",
      "He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that \u201cwe will go to the moon\u201d six decades earlier.",
      "\"Beating cancer is something we can do together,\" Biden said.",
      "By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.",
      "Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau\u2019s death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.",
      "\u201cWhen they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same \u2014 headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son Beau was one of them.\u201d",
      "Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden \u201cknew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to address that.\u201d",
      "McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cHe had an option to stretch it out,\" he said. \"He said no way.\u201d",
      "The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. They were both basal cell carcinoma.",
      "Learning of the diagnosis \u201cwas a little harder than I thought,\u201d she told The Associated Press during a trip to Africa.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\" she said. \"Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I\u2019m healthy.\u201d",
      "Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality.",
      "Months after ending his first presidential campaign in 1988, he collapsed in a New York hotel room. In his memoir \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d he described \u201clightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge \u2014 and then a rip of pain like I\u2019d never felt before.\u201d",
      "He had suffered a brain aneurysm that required surgery. Biden wrote that \u201cI had no real fear of dying. I\u2019d long since accepted the fact that life\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t include a fair shake.\u201d",
      "McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.",

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization on Monday opened its annual meeting of government ministers and other top envoys facing one of the most serious crises of its 77-year history in the wake of Trump administration funding cuts and plans to withdraw the United States.",
      "The U.N. health agency this year has seen a plunge in its ability to carry out its sweeping mandate to do everything from recommend reductions in sugar levels in soft drinks to head the global response to pandemics like COVID-19 or outbreaks like polio or Ebola.",
      "Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been grappling with a response to the U.S. cuts as well as reduced outlays from other traditional Western donors who are putting more money toward defense and less toward humanitarian aid.",

      "On tap for the nine-day World Health Assembly are two major advances that are aimed to buttress WHO\u2019s financial strength and bolster the world\u2019s ability to cope with pandemics in the future.",
      "Member countries are expected to agree to raise annual dues, known as \u201cassessed contributions,\u201d by 20% to support WHO finances and reduce dependency on governments\u2019 voluntary contributions \u2014 which change each year and make up over half of the budget.",
      "They are also expected to agree to a hard-wrought \u201c pandemic treaty \u201d that was born of a desire to avoid any replay of the patchy, unequal response to COVID-19 when the next \u2014 and inevitable, most experts say \u2014 pandemic hits.",
      "Among other things, the treaty would guarantee that countries that share critical samples of viruses will receive any resulting tests, medicines and vaccines and give WHO up to 20% of such products to make sure poorer countries can have access to them.",
      "Tedros calls the treaty \u201ctruly historic\u201d and said it \u201ccan make the world safer\u201d by boosting collaboration to prepare for, prevent and respond to pandemics.",
      "The treaty\u2019s effectiveness will face doubts when the U.S. \u2014 which poured billions into speedy work by pharmaceutical companies to develop COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 is sitting out, and because countries face no penalties if they ignore it, a common issue in international law.",
      "Kavanagh said passage of the treaty \u201ccould be a significant victory \u2014 evidence that the U.S. government may no longer be indispensable in global health\u201d and could offer an opportunity for developing nations in the \u201cglobal South\u201d over the longer term.",
      "In the run-up to the assembly, WHO has been cleaning house and cutting costs. Its management has presented a budget for the next two years at just under $4.3 billion, which is 22% less than originally planned \u2014 largely in response to Western funding cuts.",
      "At a meeting on its budget last week, Tedros \u2014 a former Ethiopian health and foreign minister \u2013 announced a shake-up of top management that included the exit of key adviser Dr. Michael Ryan from the job as emergencies chief.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- Feel like you can't focus? Like you'll never finish a book again? Like the only way to keep your mind and hands busy is to scroll on social media for hours?",
      "You're far from alone. One body of decades-long research found the average person's attention span for a single screen is 47 seconds, down from 2.5 minutes in 2004. The 24/7 news cycle, uncertainty about the state of the world and countless hours of screen time don\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen my patients talk to me about this stuff there is often a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ziffra, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cBut you can change these behaviors. You can improve your attention span.\u201d",
      "Here are ways to start that process. As you read, challenge yourself to set a 2.5 minute timer and stay on this article without looking at another device or clicking away.",
      "A shifting attention is an evolutionary feature, not a bug. Our brains are hardwired to quickly filter information and hone in on potential threats or changes in what's happening around us.",
      "What's grabbing our attentions has changed. For our ancestors, it might have been a rustle in the bushes putting us on guard for a lurking tiger. Today, it could be a rash of breaking news alerts and phone notifications.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic warped many people's sense of time and increased their screen usage like never before, said Stacey Nye, a clinical psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.",
      "Technology isn't the only thing that influences our attention, experts say, but the effects of those pinging notifications or hours scrolling through 30-second long videos can build up over time.",
      "\u201cOur attention span has really been trained to only focus in those little, small blips and it interrupts our natural focus cycles,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts say \u201cactive\u201d breaks are among the best way to retrain your mind and your attention. They only take about 30 minutes, Nye said, and can be as simple as taking a walk while noticing things around you or moving to another room for lunch.",
      "Don't be afraid to get creative. Develop a list of alternative activities or randomly choose ideas out of a fish bowl. Try craft projects, a short meditation, fixing a quick meal or talking a walk outside. All the better if you can involve a friend as well.",
      "The break needs to be a physical or mental activity \u2014 no passive phone-scrolling.",
      "When the brain is understimulated and looking for change, it\u2019ll usually grab onto the first thing it sees. The smartphone, an \u201cever-producing change machine,\u201d is an enticing option, said Cindy Lustig, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan.",
      "Turn off unnecessary notifications and put that \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode to good use, especially before bedtime. Better yet, put your phone in a whole different room, Lustig said.",
      "Multitasking may make you feel like you're getting more done, but brain experts recommend against it.",
      "\u201cBe a single tasker,\" Nye said. \u201cWork on one thing at a time, for a specified period of time and begin to work your way up.\u201d",
      "Lustig is a big fan of the \u201cPomodoro technique,\" in which you set a timer and work on something for 25 or 30 minutes before taking a five-minute break.",
      "She tells herself: \u201cI can do anything for this amount of time,\" and the world will still be waiting for her at the end.",
      "It's not enough to just have a hobby, Lustig said. It helps to choose hobbies that include deliberate practice and a goal to strive toward, whether it's playing guitar for an audience or improving in a sport.",
      "It helps to pick something that you enjoy as well.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to start with the heavy nonfiction or like \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u201d Lustig said. \u201cIf you need to start with the romance novel, then start with the romance novel. You can work your way up.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone has good and bad days, and attention needs are different \u2014 and even vary from task to task.",
      "The key is to make an intentional effort, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is in many ways similar to a muscle in the sense that we can build it up with practice and exercises,\u201d Ziffra said. \u201cConversely, it can weaken if we\u2019re not exercising it.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe just don't know why there haven't been cases,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \u201cI think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected.\u201d",
      "The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.",
      "In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.",
      "The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in Nevada, Ohio and Wyoming.",
      "California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation\u2019s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.",
      "During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.",
      "That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases.",
      "It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.",
      "What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently.",
      "New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago.",
      "\u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.",
      "Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
      "Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.",
      "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said \"targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.\"",
      "She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.",
      "\"I can\u2019t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,\u201d she said.",
      "The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.",
      "Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.",
      "Still, research is continuing.",
      "Texas A&M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.",
      "Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.",
      "\u201cWe have had very good participation,\u201d Douphrate said. \u201cThey have been very willing.\u201d",
      "Similar surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.",
      "Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.",
      "Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu \u2014 or whether the virus can spill over into people.",
      "Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.",
      "\u201cIt's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we really need to be doing is ramping up.\u201d",

      "Infant twins suffered from malnutrition in Nigeria",
      "DIKWA, Nigeria -- Under the dappled light of a thatched shelter, Yagana Bulama cradles her surviving infant. The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria\u2019s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.",
      "\u201cFeeding is severely difficult,\u201d said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa \u2014 virtually the entire population \u2014 rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated \u201csafe zone,\u201d which severely limits farming.",
      "For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.",
      "Programs serving children were hit hard.",
      "Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.",
      "But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.",
      "She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bury another child,\u201d she said.",
      "Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.",
      "He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.",
      "\u201cIt is very traumatic,\u201d said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. \u201cOne of the things is the threat to the lives of children.\u201d",
      "UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.",
      "Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.",
      "\u201cBefore the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,\u201d said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. \u201cNow my biggest worry is high mortality. We don\u2019t have enough resources to keep up.\u201d",
      "Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.",
      "The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.",
      "\u201cIt used to be far less,\u201d said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.",
      "The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.",
      "\u201cBefore, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,\u201d said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. \u201cNow, that has stopped.\u201d",
      "Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, \u201csadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.\u201d He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.",
      "The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.",
      "In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the needy, said Frederico Jo\u00e3o, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.",
      "More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inoc\u00eancio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.",

    "story": [
      "The British government will roll out the use of medication to suppress the sex drive of sex offenders",
      "LONDON -- The British government is to rollout the use of medication to suppress the sex drive of sex offenders, as part of a package of measures to reduce the risk of reoffending and alleviate the pressures on the prison system, which is running out of space.",
      "In a statement to Parliament Thursday following the release of an independent sentencing review, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said so-called chemical castration would be used in 20 prisons in two regions.",
      "\u201cAnd I am exploring whether mandating the approach is possible,\" she said. \u201cOf course, it is vital that this approach is taken alongside psychological interventions that target other causes of offending, like asserting power and control.\u201d",
      "Though the review highlighted the treatment would not be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation, Mahmood said studies show that chemical castration can lead to a 60% reduction in reoffending.",
      "It's been used in Germany and Denmark on a voluntary basis, and in Poland as mandatory for some offenders.",
      "The recommendation was part of a wide-ranging review led by former justice secretary, David Gauke. As well as looking at ways to cut reoffending, Gauke recommended reforms to overhaul the prisons system, which is running at near-capacity.",
      "One of the first things Mahmood did as justice minister after Labour returned to power after 14 years last July was sanction an early-release program for prisoners to free up space. She says she doesn't want to do that again and set up the review and appointed a Conservative predecessor to oversee it.",
      "The review recommended that criminals could be released from prison earlier than currently, while judges could be given more flexibility to impose punishments such as driving bans. It also recommended that sentences of less than 12 months would also be scrapped, apart from exceptional circumstances such as domestic abuse cases.",
      "It also called for the immediate deportation for foreign nationals handed a three-year sentence or less.",
      "The review called for higher investment in the probation service to allow officers to spend more time with offenders for their rehabilitation and extra funding for the tens of thousands more offenders being electronically tagged in the community.",
      "Mahmood responded by giving a 700 million-pound ($930 million) a year for probation within years.",
      "\u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t put the resources into probation that is necessary, then the risk here is that we won\u2019t make progress on rehabilitation that we need, and there will be a public backlash against it,\" Gauke said.",
      "The prison population in England and Wales has doubled over the past 30 years or so to nearly 90,000. That's despite a fall in crime rates and is driven in part by the fact that longer sentences are being handed out amid pressure to be tough on crime.",
      "Robert Jenrick, the justice spokesman for the Conservatives, was clear in his opposition to the proposals and warned that scrapping short sentences would be effectively \u201cdecriminalizing\u201d offenses like burglary, theft and assault. And tags, he said, are as useful as \u201csmoke alarms putting out bonfires\u201d when it comes to stopping reoffending.",
      "Alongside accepting any changes, the government has said it will embark on a big prison building program, partly to replace some that have been used since Victorian times in the late 19th century.",

      "In recent years, some city registrars had begun to record only the name of the biological mother on birth certificates, and not the name of her partner. In order to have legal rights and responsibility over the child, the non-biological mother then had to \u201cadopt\u201d the child.",

But thanks to an Interior Ministry circular in 2023, the restrictions were being enforced anew as part of the policy of the far-right-led government of Premier Giorgia Meloni to crack down on surrogacy and promote traditional family values.",

      "The governments of Britain and Mauritius have reached a final deal to settle the future of the Chagos Islands but have been barred from signing it by a British judge",
      "LONDON -- The governments of Britain and Mauritius have reached a final deal to settle the future of the Chagos Islands, the contested archipelago in the middle of the Indian Ocean that's home to a strategically important U.S. military base.",
      "But they have been barred from signing it, at least temporarily, by a British judge.",
      "The agreement would transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands from the U.K. to Mauritius \u2014 though Britain would retain control of the largest of the chain of islands, Diego Garcia, which hosts the American naval and bomber base.",
      "The two countries reached an initial agreement in October, but it was put on hold after Britain said it had to wait for the approval of U.S. President Donald Trump. The deal also became stuck after a change of government in Mauritius, amid quarrels over how much money the U.K. should pay for the lease of Diego Garcia. The U.S. pays Britain an unspecified amount to operate the base.",
      "Here's what to know about the disputed islands.",
      "The remote chain of more than 60 islands is located in the middle of the Indian Ocean off the tip of India, south of the Maldives.",
      "The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814, when they were ceded by France.",
      "The archipelago is best known for the military base on Diego Garcia, which has supported U.S. military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the U.S. acknowledged it also had been used for clandestine rendition flights of terror suspects.",
      "Britain split the Chagos Islands away from Mauritius, a former British colony, in 1965, three years before Mauritius gained independence, and called the Chagos archipelago the British Indian Ocean Territory.",
      "In the 1960s and 1970s Britain evicted as many as 2,000 people from the islands so the U.S. military could build the Diego Garcia base.",
      "The U.S. has described the base, which is home to about 2,500 mostly American personnel, as \u201can all but indispensable platform\u201d for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa.",
      "Most recently, the U.S. deployed several nuclear-capable B-2 Spirit bombers to Diego Garcia amid an intense airstrike campaign targeting Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels.",
      "In recent years criticism grew over Britain's control of the archipelago and the way it forcibly displaced the local population. The United Nations and the International Court of Justice have both urged Britain to end its \u201ccolonial administration\u201d of the islands and transfer their sovereignty to Mauritius.",
      "In October Britain's government announced that it was finalizing details of a treaty to hand sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, with the exception of Diego Garcia, which will remain under British control for at least 99 years.",
      "The deal was hailed by then-U.S. President Joe Biden as a \u201chistoric agreement\u201d that secured the future of the Diego Garcia base. But Britain's opposition Conservatives slammed the government for surrendering control of the territory, saying that the decision exposed the U.K. and its allies to security threats. Last year the now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said it posed \u201ca serious threat\u201d to U.S. national security.",
      "In January, Britain\u2019s government confirmed that the Trump administration was reviewing a renegotiated deal, without providing details.",
      "In February, Trump suggested he was in favor of the agreement when he met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington.",
      "Meanwhile voters in Mauritius ousted the government that made the deal, and new Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam backed away from it, citing financial concerns.",
      "Ramgoolam suggested that the initial deal \u2014 which would reportedly see the U.K. pay 90 million pounds ($116 million) a year to Mauritius for the continued operation of the Diego Garcia military base \u2014 was a \u201csellout.\" The U.K. government has not disclosed how much it will pay to lease the base.",
      "After more negotiations, a final deal was set to be signed by the two countries' leaders on Thursday.",
      "But hours before the ceremony, a High Court judge imposed an injunction stopping the handover. Judge Julian Goose ordered the British government \"to maintain the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom over the British Indian Ocean Territory until further order.\u201d",
      "An estimated 10,000 displaced Chagossians and their descendants now live primarily in Britain, Mauritius and the Seychelles. Many of them want to return to the islands, and some have fought unsuccessfully in U.K. courts for many years for the right to go home.",
      "Chagossians say they were left out of the political negotiations, which have left them unclear on whether they and their descendants could ever be allowed to return to their homeland.",
      "Human Rights Watch has said that Britain's forced displacement of the Chagossians and ongoing refusal to let them go home \u201camount to crimes against humanity committed by a colonial power against an Indigenous people.\u201d",
      "The draft deal stated a resettlement fund would be created for displaced islanders to help them move back to the islands, apart from Diego Garcia. But details of how that will work remain sketchy.",
      "Two Chagossian women, Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, challenged the handover deal in the British courts. They argue it will become even harder to return once Mauritius takes control of the islands.",
      "Thursday's court injunction was granted in response to their application.",

      "The ongoing protests were sparked by reports of lavish spending by the prime minister's son. For the mostly young protesters, the reports brought to a head long-simmering complaints about government corruption involving officials and their families.",

      "The protesters say the country's mineral riches have benefited business interests and the wealthy, while many Mongolians still live in poverty.",
      "The coalition government was formed after an election setback for the People's Party's last June that reduced its majority to 68 seats in the 126-member parliament. The Democratic Party holds 42 seats and the third coalition member, the HUN party, has eight.",

      "TALLINN, Estonia -- A Belarusian man has died in prison while serving a sentence for insulting the country's authoritarian president, a human rights group said Thursday, adding to a growing number of political prisoners who perished amid a relentless crackdown on dissent in the tightly controlled country.",
      "Valiantsin Shtermer, 61, died in a prison colony in the city of Shklow in eastern Belarus, the Viasna Human Rights Center said. The exact date and the circumstances of his death weren't immediately known.",
      "Shtermer, a businessman, was handed a five-year sentence after he was convicted in October 2023 on charges of insulting Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and criticizing the Russian war in Ukraine. He was put on the list of \u201cextremists\u201d and \u201cterrorists,\u201d designations that implied particularly tough prison conditions.",
      "Belarus was shaken by mass protests in 2020 following a disputed election that handed Lukashenko his sixth consecutive term in office. Authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown, in which more than 65,000 people were arrested and thousands were beaten by police. Top opposition figures were jailed or forced into exile, and hundreds of thousands fled abroad, fearing prosecution.",
      "Shtermer was the eighth political prisoner to die in custody since 2020, according to Viasna. The group said Belarus currently holds nearly 1,200 political prisoners, including its founder, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski.",
      "Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for over 30 years and has relied on Kremlin subsidies and support, allowed Russia to use his country\u2019s territory to send troops into neighboring Ukraine in 2022 and to host some of its tactical nuclear weapons.",
      "Belarusian authorities have recently released some political prisoners, including several U.S. citizens in what some observers saw as an attempt by Lukashenko to try to mend ties with the West, but others have remained behind bars.",
      "The prison where Shtermer died has been known for its harsh conditions. Human rights activists said that he had suffered a stroke before being sent to the prison, but was put in a penitentiary cell upon arrival. He spoke with difficulty, had trouble walking and injured his hand after collapsing but never received medical assistance, they said.",
      "Another political prisoner, Vitold Ashurok, died in the same prison in 2021.",

      "After deliberations on Thursday, Romania\u2019s Constitutional Court unanimously rejected the annulment request, filed on Tuesday by George Simion, in which he alleged that foreign interference and coordinated manipulation affected the vote.",
      "The Court then validated the results and held a short ceremony attended by the elected President Nicusor Dan, the Bucharest mayor who won the tense runoff, beating Simion with 53.6% of the vote, a margin of more than 829,000 votes.",
      "\u201cI want to thank the Romanian people who turned out in great numbers for the May elections and, in doing so, gave legitimacy to the new president,\u201d 55-year-old Dan, a mathematician and former civic activist, said at the court during the ceremony.",
      "\u201cA new chapter is beginning in Romania\u2019s recent and contemporary history. I want to assure Romanian citizens that I understand the responsibility of the mandate they have entrusted to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be many challenges, and I hope that we will successfully overcome all of them.\u201d",
      "Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, had conceded defeat after losing in the runoff to Dan, but later contested the results. The court said its decision on Thursday is final.",
      "In his request to annul the election, Simion claimed he had \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d that France, Moldova and \u201cother actors\u201d meddled in the ballot, but did not present any evidence. He also alleged that \u201cdeceased people\u201d had participated in the vote, and that he requested it be canceled on the same grounds as the court\u2019s decision last year.",
      "After the court rejected his annulment request, Simion said in a post on Facebook that the Court \u201chas continued the coup!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have no choice but to fight!,\u201d his post read. \u201cI call on you to stand with me, today and in the coming weeks!\u201d",
      "Sunday\u2019s tense vote was held months after the same court voided the previous election in which the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu led the first round, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied.",
      "The Court's unprecedented decision last year to cancel the election plunged EU and NATO member Romania into its worst political crisis in decades, compounded by a string of crises such as the war in neighboring Ukraine and a significant budget deficit.",
      "Dan is expected to be officially sworn in next week, after which he must also contend with deep societal divisions laid bare by the vote, revealing a country where endemic corruption, inequality and an erosion of trust in traditional institutions and parties have fueled a broad rejection of the political establishment.",
      "\"Romanian society has shown wisdom, and I am convinced that in the period ahead, it will continue to push for the positive change that Romania needs,\u201d Dan added Thursday. \"I will fight for the strengthening of state institutions ... I will also fight for the country\u2019s economic prosperity, I will be a partner to the business environment, and I will be a guarantor of civil liberties.\"",
      "Dan will also face the challenge of nominating a prime minister who can garner the support necessary to form a government \u2014 a tall order in a country where strong anti-establishment sentiment led to the emergence of figures like Georgescu and Simion.",
      "Simion capitalized on the furor over last year's annulment and, after coming fourth in the canceled race, allied with Georgescu, who was banned in March from running in the election redo. In the first-round vote on May 4 in the rerun, Simion won a landslide in a field of 11 candidates to enter the runoff.",
      "Hours after voting opened on Friday for Romanians abroad, Simion accused the government of neighboring Moldova of election fraud, which both Moldovan and Romanian authorities rejected.",
      "In comment to The Associated Press on Sunday, he reiterated claims that people were being illegally transported to voting stations in Moldova, allegedly affecting 80,000 votes.",
      "More than half a million Moldovans hold Romanian citizenship, and about 158,000 people voted at polling stations set up in Moldova in the second round. Many more dual citizens would also have cast ballots in other countries.",
      "As a member of the EU and one of the easternmost members of the NATO military alliance, Romania plays a pivotal role in Western security infrastructure \u2014 especially since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Many observers saw Sunday\u2019s vote as crucial to maintaining Romania\u2019s place within the network of Western alliances \u2014 especially amid fears that the Trump administration is reconsidering its security commitments to the United States\u2019 European partners.",

      "It\u2019s the fallout of last month\u2019s gun massacre that left 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, dead in Indian-controlled Kashmir followed by tit-for-tat military strikes by India and Pakistan, bringing the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of their third war over the region.",
      "\u201cThere might be some tourist arrivals, but it counts almost negligible. It is almost a zero footfall right now,\u201d said Yaseen Tuman, who operates multiple houseboats in the region\u2019s main city of Srinagar. \u201cThere is a haunting silence now.\u201d",
      "Tens of thousands of panicked tourists left Kashmir within days after the rare killings of tourists on April 22 at a picture-perfect meadow in southern resort town of Pahalgam. Following the attack, authorities temporarily closed dozens of tourist resorts in the region, adding to fear and causing occupancy rates to plummet.",
      "Graphic images, repeatedly circulated through TV channels and social media, deepened panic and anger. India blamed Pakistan for supporting the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied.",
      "Those who had stayed put fled soon after tensions between India and Pakistan spiked. As the two countries fired missiles and drones at each other, the region witnessed mass cancellations of tourist bookings. New Delhi and Islamabad reached a U.S.-mediated ceasefire on May 10 but hardly any new bookings have come in, tour operators said.",
      "Sheikh Bashir Ahmed, vice president of the Kashmir Hotel and Restaurant Association, said at least 12,000 rooms in the region\u2019s hundreds of hotels and guesthouses were previously booked until June. Almost all bookings have been cancelled, and tens of thousands of people associated with hotels are without jobs, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss.\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "The decline has had a ripple effect on the local economy. Handicrafts, food stalls and taxi operators have lost most of their business.",
      "Idyllic destinations, like the resort towns of Gulmarg and Pahalgam, once a magnet for travelers, are eerily silent. Lines of colorful hand-carved boats, known as shikaras, lie deserted, mostly anchored still on Srinagar\u2019s normally bustling Dal Lake. Tens of thousands of daily wage workers have hardly any work.",
      "\u201cThere used to be long lines of tourists waiting for boat rides. There are none now,\u201d said boatman Fayaz Ahmed.",
      "Taxi driver Mohammed Irfan would take tourists for long drives to hill stations and show them grand Mughal-era gardens. \u201cEven a half day of break was a luxury, and we would pray for it. Now, my taxi lies standstill for almost two weeks,\u201d he said.",
      "In recent years, the tourism sector grew substantially, making up about 7% of the region\u2019s economy, according to official figures. Omar Abdullah, Kashmir\u2019s top elected official, said before the attack on tourists that the government was aiming to increase tourism's share of the economy to at least 15% in the next four to five years.",
      "Indian-controlled Kashmir was a top destination for visitors until the armed rebellion against Indian rule began in 1989. Warfare laid waste to the stunningly beautiful region, which is partly controlled by Pakistan and claimed by both countries in its entirety.",
      "As the conflict ground on, the tourism sector slowly revived but occasional military skirmishes between India and Pakistan kept visitors at bay.",
      "But India vigorously pushed tourism after Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government scrapped the disputed region\u2019s semi-autonomy in 2019. Tensions have simmered, but the region has also drawn millions of visitors amid a strange calm enforced by an intensified security crackdown.",
      "According to official data, close to 3 million tourists visited the region in 2024, a rise from 2.71 million visitors in 2023 and 2.67 million in 2022. The massive influx prompted many locals to invest in the sector, setting up family-run guesthouses, luxury hotels, and transport companies in a region with few alternatives.",
      "Tourists remained largely unfazed even as Modi\u2019s administration has governed Kashmir with an iron fist in recent years, claiming militancy in the region was in check and a tourism influx was a sign of normalcy returning.",
      "The massacre shattered those claims. Experts say that the Modi government\u2019s optimism was largely misplaced and that the rising tourism in the region of which it boasted was a fragile barometer of normalcy. Last year, Abdullah, the region\u2019s chief minister, cautioned against such optimism.",
      "Tuman, who is also a sixth-generation tour operator, said he was not too optimistic about an immediate revival as bookings for the summer were almost all canceled.",
      "\u201cIf all goes well, it will take at least six months for tourism to revive,\u201d he said.",
      "Ahmed, the hotels association official, said India and Pakistan need to resolve the dispute for the region\u2019s prosperity. \u201cTourism needs peace. If (Kashmir) problem is not solved \u2026 maybe after two months, it will be again same thing.\u201d",

      "Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thrusday asked all of his Cabinet secretaries to submit resignations in a \u201cbold reset\u201d of his administration following last week\u2019s mid-term elections, which saw more opposition candidates win crucial Senate ...",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. asked all of his Cabinet secretaries to submit resignations on Thursday in a \u201cbold reset\u201d of his administration following last week\u2019s mid-term elections, which saw more opposition candidates win crucial Senate seats.",
      "Marcos, the 67-year-old son of a late Philippine dictator overthrown in 1986, won the presidency in the deeply divided Southeast Asian country by a landslide in 2022 in a stunning political comeback as he made a steadfast call for national unity. But his equally popular vice-presidential running mate, Sara Duterte, later broke from him in a falling out that has sparked intense political discord.",
      "With support from treaty ally the United States and other friendly countries, Marcos emerged as the most vocal critic of China \u2019s growing aggression in the disputed South China Sea while contending with an array of longstanding domestic issues, including inflation \u2014 and delayed fulfillment of a campaign promise to bring down the price of rice \u2014 as well as many reports of kidnappings and other crimes.",
      "\u201cThis is not business as usual,\u201d Marcos was cited as saying in a government statement. \u201cThe people have spoken and they expect results \u2014 not politics, not excuses. We hear them and we will act.\u201d",
      "Marcos called for the \u201ccourtesy resignation of all Cabinet secretaries in a decisive move to recalibrate his administration following the results of the recent elections,\u201d the government statement said.",
      "\"The request for courtesy resignations is aimed at giving the president the elbow room to evaluate the performance of each department and determine who will continue to serve in line with his administration\u2019s recalibrated priorities,\u201d the government said.",
      "At least 21 Cabinet secretaries led by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin either immediately submitted their resignations or expressed their readiness to do so.",
      "\u201cThis is not about personalities \u2014 it\u2019s about performance, alignment and urgency,\u201d Marcos said. \u201cThose who have delivered and continue to deliver will be recognized. But we cannot afford to be complacent. The time for comfort zones is over.\u201d",
      "Government services will remain uninterrupted during the transition, the government said, adding that \u201cwith this bold reset, the Marcos administration signals a new phase \u2014 sharper, faster and fully focused on the people\u2019s most pressing needs.\"",
      "Five out of the 12 Senate seats contested in the mid-term elections were won by allies of Sara Duterte or her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been arrested and detained by the International Criminal Court in The Hague in the Netherlands. The elder Duterte, a staunch critic of Marcos, was accused of committing crimes against humanity over a brutal anti-drugs crackdown he launched that left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead.",
      "Marcos-endorsed senatorial candidates won five Senate seats while two other seats were unexpectedly won by two liberal democrats associated with the late former President Benigno Aquino III, whose family has long been at odds with the Marcoses.",
      "Voting for half of the 24-member Senate is crucial because the government body will hold an impeachment trial for Sara Duterte in July over an array of criminal allegations, including corruption and a public threat to assassinate Marcos, his wife and House Speaker Martin Romualdez. She made those threats in an online news conference in November but later issued a vague denial that she wanted the president killed.",
      "Sara Duterte is facing a separate criminal complaint for her threats against the Marcoses and Romualdez.",
      "Most of the seats in the House were won by candidates allied with Marcos and his cousin, Romualdez, in the May 12 elections, which many saw as a preview to the presidential elections scheduled for 2028.",

    "story": [
      "North Korea says a new 5,000-ton destroyer key to its naval advancement was damaged during its launching ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea's second naval destroyer was damaged in a failed launch this week, state media reported Thursday, sparking fury from leader Kim Jong Un, who wants bigger warships to deal with what he calls escalating U.S.-led threats against his country.",
      "It's not common for North Korea to acknowledge military-related setbacks, but observers say the disclosure of the failed ship launch suggests that Kim is serious about his naval advancement program and confident of ultimately achieving that objective.",
      "During a launching event at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, the newly built 5,000-ton-class destroyer became unbalanced and was punctured in its bottom sections after a transport cradle on the stern section slid off first and became stuck, according to the Korean Central News Agency.",
      "KCNA didn't provide details on what caused the problem, the severity of the damage or whether anyone was injured.",
      "According to KCNA, Kim, who was present at the ceremony, blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators for a \u201cserious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism.\" Kim called for a ruling Workers\u2019 Party meeting slated for late June to address their \u201cirresponsible errors.\"",
      "\u201cIt's a shameful thing. But the reason why North Korea disclosed the incident is it wants to show it's speeding up the modernization of its navy forces and expresses its confidence that it can eventually build\" a greater navy, said Moon Keun-sik, a navy expert who teaches at Seoul\u2019s Hanyang University.",
      "Moon suspected the incident likely happened because North Korean workers aren't yet familiar with such a large warship and were rushed to put it in the water.",
      "The damaged vessel was likely the same class as the country\u2019s first destroyer unveiled last month, which experts assessed as North Korea's largest and most advanced warship to date. Kim called the first vessel, named Choe Hyon \u2014 a famed Korean guerilla fighter during the Japanese colonial period \u2014 a significant asset for advancing his goal of expanding the military\u2019s operational range and nuclear strike capabilities.",
      "State media described that ship as designed to carry weapons systems including nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. Kim said the ship was expected to enter active duty early next year and later supervised test-firings of missiles from the warship.",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the damaged vessel was likely equipped with similar systems and remains toppled over in the sea. An Associated Press analysis of Planet Labs PBC images taken Thursday showed the ship partially submerged on its side with tarpaulins draped over the wreckage.",
      "Earlier commercial satellite images indicated that the country was building its second destroyer at a shipyard in Chongjin.",
      "Beyond Parallel, a website run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the satellite imagery of Chongjin\u2019s Hambuk shipyard on May 12 showed that a second vessel in the Choe Hyon-class of guided missile destroyers was under construction.",
      "A report by the North Korea-focused 38 North website assessed last week that the destroyer in Chongjin was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, a method that has been rarely used in North Korea. The report said the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo, in contrast, used a floating dry dock.",
      "South Korean officials and experts say the Choe Hyon destroyer was likely built with Russian assistance as the two countries' military partnerships are booming. While North Korea\u2019s naval forces are considered far inferior to those of its rivals, analysts say the destroyer with nuclear-capable missiles and an advanced radar system would still enhance the North's offensive and defensive capabilities.",
      "Kim has framed the arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the United States and South Korea, which have been expanding joint military exercises in response to the North\u2019s advancing nuclear program. He says the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening the North Korean navy.",
      "Hours after releasing the report on the damaged destroyer, North Korea test-fired multiple cruise missiles from an area about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Chongjin, according to South Korea's military. The launches were a continuation of a streak of weapons-testing activities by North Korea in recent years. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the launches were being analyzed by South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities.",

      "The multilayered, $175 billion system would for the first time put U.S. weapons in space. Trump said the previous day he expected the system to be fully operational by the end of his term in 2029.",
      "\"Is it a good idea for Canada? Yes, it is a good to have protections in place for Canadians,\" Carney said.",
      "Carney confirmed he's had talks with Trump about it and said there are discussions with senior officials. Trump said the Canadian government had contacted his administration indicating it wants to join the program and that he will work with Ottawa to ensure it contributes its \u201cfair share.\u201d",
      "Golden Dome is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities to detect and stop missiles at all four major stages of a potential attack: detecting and destroying them before a launch, intercepting them in their earliest stage of flight, stopping them midcourse in the air, or halting them in the final minutes as they descend toward a target.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that we are looking at and something that has been discussed at a high level.\" Carney said. \u201cBut not I\u2019m not sure one negotiates on this. These are military decisions that have been taken in that context, and we will evaluate it accordingly.\u201d",
      "Carney warned that Canada faces potential missiles threats in the \u201cnot-too-distant future\u201d that could come from space.",
      "\u201cIs Canada going to be doing this alone or with the United States? Because with a Golden Dome, there will be discussions that could have an impact on Canada, but Canada wouldn't be a part of them,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The Pentagon has warned for years that the newest missiles developed by China and Russia are so advanced that updated countermeasures are necessary. Golden Dome\u2019s added satellites and interceptors \u2014 where the bulk of the program\u2019s cost is \u2014 would be focused on stopping those advanced missiles early on or in the middle of their flight.",
      "Canada and the U.S. are partners in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the combined organization that provides shared defense of airspace over the two nations.",
      "The newly elected Carney spent much spent much of the last few months saying the old relationship with the U.S. based on steadily increasing integration is over. Trump has infuriated Canadians by saying Canada should be the 51st state.",
      "\u201cWe cooperate if necessary but not necessarily cooperate,\u201d Carney said.",

      "Pablo V\u00e1zquez Camacho said investigators had identified and found a motorcycle and two other vehicles used in the escape of the gunman who killed the two officials Tuesday morning as they traveled in a vehicle along a busy thoroughfare.",
      "Brugada's personal secretary, Ximena Guzm\u00e1n, and an adviser, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, were shot dead in Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s car, authorities said.",
      "Mexico City chief prosecutor Bertha Alcalde Luj\u00e1n said the gunman had fled on a motorcycle that was hidden nearby and then changed vehicles twice as he and others fled into neighboring Mexico State.",
      "Clothes were recovered in the vehicles and were being analyzed, but investigators could not yet offer a possible motive, the prosecutor said.",
      "She said Guzm\u00e1n was shot eight times and Mu\u00f1oz four times.",

      "\u201cWe cannot conclude that this is tied to organized crime, much less speak now of a particular organized crime group,\u201d Alcalde said.",
      "Both officials said Wednesday that investigators had detected the presence of an individual at the site of the attacks days before they occurred, which would suggest knowledge of the victims' routines.",
      "The attack, which happened at around 7 a.m., left four bullet holes clustered on the driver\u2019s side of the windshield. One body lay on the pavement.",
      "V\u00e1zquez Camacho said that neither Guzm\u00e1n nor Mu\u00f1oz had any special security measures, but both had received training about protecting themselves.",
      "\u201cThey are people who worked very closely with the people ... and they did their work without fear,\u201d he said.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum, who is an ally of Brugada and a former mayor of Mexico City before winning the presidency last year, had declined to speculate on the possible involvement of organized crime during her press briefing earlier Wednesday.",
      "At the scene of the attack Wednesday morning, hundreds of commuters passed with most oblivious to what had occurred a day earlier. Some, however, noticed the handwritten signs with messages of remembrance to the two victims and flowers and candles left on the sidewalk.",
      "University student Loretta Garc\u00eda Oriz said she had passed the site Tuesday when Guzm\u00e1n and Mu\u00f1oz's bodies were still at the scene. \u201cPassing here gives me the same trauma,\u201d she said Wednesday.",
      "Oscar S\u00e1nchez's taco stand isn't far from the crime scene, but said Wednesday he didn't know what had happened until another vendor told him and police began to set up a perimeter. The attack showed that it doesn't matter if you're an official or an average person, he said. \"It's all the same.\"",
      "Mexico City's mayor is considered second in political importance only to the president. The mayor's office has long been a stepping stone to the presidency, something true for Sheinbaum and her predecessor.",
      "But for years, the idea has prevailed of Mexico City as a relatively peaceful oasis protected from the brutal drug cartel violence prevalent in other parts of the country. There has always been street crime, but the cartels, while present, maintained a lower profile in the capital.",
      "That illusion was partially dashed in 2020 with the brazen ambush of Mexico City's then police chief on another central boulevard. Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch was wounded, but two bodyguards and a bystander were killed in the attack involving more than 20 people and heavy weaponry.",

      "In 2018, Guyana went to the International Court of Justice and asked judges to uphold the 1899 ruling. Meanwhile, Venezuela has dismissed the border drawn more than a century ago, noting Guyana was still a British colony.

A peace deal reached in 2018 has been fragile and not fully implemented, to the frustration of the U.S. and other international backers. South Sudan still hasn\u2019t held a long-delayed presidential election, and Kiir remains in power.",

Machar was arrested and allies in the government and military were detained following a major escalation that included airstrikes and an attack on a United Nations helicopter. Machar\u2019s opposition party announced South Sudan\u2019s peace deal was effectively over.",

      "Now there is less support than ever for most of South Sudan's over 11 million people because of the cuts in U.S. aid.",
      "Climate shocks including flooding have long caused mass displacement and closed schools. South Sudan\u2019s health and education systems were already among the weakest in the world. Aid organizations had offered essential help.",
      "South Sudan's government has long relied on oil production, but little money from that is seen, in part because of official corruption. Conflict in neighboring Sudan has affected landlocked South Sudan\u2019s oil exports. Civil servants at times go months without being paid.",

Although it is hard to define an age group for personalized programs, Prevost's plan was more befitting of men aged 50-55. Masella would train him two or three times a week in sessions lasting up to an hour.",
      "So, how much does the pope bench? Masella can\u2019t speak to his papal power, since Prevost was focused on posture and cardiovascular capacity. He ran on his favorite treadmill that faces a mural featuring famous local landmarks, among them St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican.",
      "\u201cWe would start off slow and then go pretty strong, I must say. Especially a lot of resistance on the exercise bike, a very strong climb,\u201d Masella said.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him make a comment about anything that wasn\u2019t positive. He was always positive about everything -- the weather, the city, the people, also for me, he said he liked the gym.\u201d",

      "After Prevost took over the Vatican\u2019s Dicastery for Bishops in 2023, he said in an interview with the Augustinian Order that his new job had left him little free time to practice his game. While the Mediterranean climate makes tennis possible year-round, the papacy will likely leave him even fewer chances to step onto a court.",
      "Tamburlani, the Omega owner, says the Holy Father is welcome back any time he wants to squeeze in a workout. After all, his membership's still active.",
      "\u201cThis would make us so happy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would organize our gym to guarantee his safety and his privacy. We would just need a sign.\u201d",

      "He said all the climbers were safe and returning back to lower camps after the successful ascent on Wednesday",
      "Climbers normally spend weeks at base camp to acclimatize to the higher altitude. They make practice runs to the lower camps on Everest before beginning their final attempt on the peak, so that their bodies are prepared for the low pressure and lower level of oxygen available.",
      "The new method is likely to reduce the time climbers spend out of their home countries and cut the number of days they need to take off work, also cutting down on expenses.",
      "Nepal does not have any rules on how many days climbers must spend acclimatizing or making practice climbs. Their permits, which cost $11,000 each, are valid for 90 days. Climbing season normally wraps up by the end of May, when the weather deteriorates and monsoon season begins. The ropes and ladders fixed to the mountain are then pulled out.",

      "Government vaccine advisers are meeting to decide if the recipe for COVID-19 vaccines needs updating for this fall and winter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for a shot.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That raises big implications for next fall's vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "FDA's independent advisers may raise those issues Thursday, but the changes are not the focus of the meeting, which was scheduled before FDA\u2019s announcement.",
      "Instead, the panel is set to recommend whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax.",
      "\u201cWe are asking for guidance to help the FDA decide what strain to select for COVID-19 vaccines going forward,\u201d FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad said in comments opening the meeting. Prasad added that the agency wants \u201cto give people a little more time to digest,\u201d the new policy on vaccines and is open to feedback.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "That JN.1 family still dominates, although it continues to evolve. The question is whether last fall\u2019s shots still offer enough cross-protection or if manufacturers instead should match today\u2019s most common subtype, called LP.8.1.",
      "The World Health Organization recently said last year's version was OK but that vaccine makers could choose an update. The European Medicines Agency instead recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "FDA officials didn\u2019t express a preference in documents posted online ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting. suggested earlier in the week that the government should move away from yearly updates.",
      "\u201cInstead of having a COVID-19 strategy that\u2019s year-to-year where we change things every single year, why don\u2019t we let the science tell us when to change?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Debating that science is what the FDA's vaccine advisers do each year. If they recommend leaving the shots unchanged \u2014 and the FDA agrees \u2014 it's possible that healthy adults and children may still get access to a fall booster, since this week's policy changes suggest new studies would be required only if manufacturers switch strains or introduce a completely new vaccine. Those would be large, six-month studies, and vaccine experts question if their cost and logistics could make them unfeasible.",
      "Still, the FDA's strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "Prasad and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary were both outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID-19 shots during the pandemic, particularly the recommendation for use in young, healthy adults and children. Before joining government, they each garnered attention from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who built a national following by casting doubt on the safety and benefits of vaccines.",
      "In a medical journal editorial outlining the FDA\u2019s new approach, they criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach, saying it has long been out of step with Europe and other places with more limited recommendations for boosters.",

      "Amber Salazar is the kind of idealist you just knew would end up running a store like Banned Wagon Books",
      "NEW YORK -- Amber Salazar is the kind of idealist you just knew would end up running a bookstore \u2014 a lifelong reader who felt angered \u201cto the core\u201d as she learned of book bans around the country.",
      "A resident of Colorado Springs, Colorado, Salazar last year opened Banned Wagon Books, a pop-up store she sets up everywhere from wineries to coffee shops, featuring such frequently censored works as Maia Kobabe's \u201cGender Queer,\u201d Angie Thomas' \u201cThe Hate U Give\u201d and Toni Morrison's \u201cBeloved.\u201d",
      "\u201cI decided that no matter what it looked like, I was going to open a bookstore so that I could contribute in some small way and stand up for intellectual freedom in the U.S.,\u201d explains Salazar, 33, who donates 5% of her profits to the American Library Association and other organizations opposing bans. \u201cSince we were coming out of the pandemic at that time, I started thinking about ways to combine my love of literature and passion for intellectual freedom with my appreciation for the small businesses in my city who weathered some difficult storms through shutdowns and supply chain concerns.\u201d",
      "Salazar is among a wave of new \u2014 and, often, younger \u2014 owners who have helped the independent book community dramatically expand, intensify and diversify. Independent bookselling is not a field for fortune seekers: Most local stores, whether run by retirees, bookworms or those switching careers in middle age, have some sense of higher purpose. But for many who opened in recent years, it's an especially critical mission. Narrative in Somerville, Massachusetts, identifies as \u201cproudly immigrant-woman owned & operated, with an emphasis on amplifying marginalized voices & experiences.\u201d In Chicago, Call & Response places \u201cthe voices of Black and other authors of color at the center of our work.\u201d",
      "Independent stores will likely never recover their power of 50 years ago, before the rise of Barnes & Noble superstores and the online giant Amazon.com. But the days of industry predictions of their demise seem well behind. In 2016, there were 1,244 members in the American Booksellers Association trade group, at 1,749 locations. As of this month, the ABA has 2,863 individual members, at 3,281 locations. And more than 200 stores are in the process of opening.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, this kind of energy,\u201d says association CEO Allison Hill, remembering how, during the pandemic, she feared that the ABA could lose up to a quarter of its membership. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us would have predicted this a few years ago.\u201d",
      "Hill and others acknowledge that even during an era of growth, booksellers remain vulnerable to political and economic challenges. Costs of supplies remain high and could grow higher because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. ABA President Cynthia Compton, who runs two stores in the Indianapolis area, says that sales to schools are down because censorship laws have made educators more cautious about what they purchase.",
      "The ABA\u2019s own website advises: \u201cPassion and knowledge have to be combined with business acumen if your bookstore is to succeed.\u201d",
      "Salazar herself is part of an Instagram chat group, Bookstores Helping Bookstores, with such like-minded sellers as the owners of The Crafty Bookstore in Bloomington, Indiana, \u201cspecializing in Indie books & custom bookish accessories,\u201d and the Florida-based Chapter Bound, an online store with a calling \u201cto connect great books with great people \u2014 at prices everyone can afford.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the age of social media, people are craving genuine connection and community,\u201d Salazar says. \u201cAnd books often provide a catalyst to that feeling of community.\u201d",
      "Stephen Sparks, who is 47 and since 2017 has owned Point Reyes Books northwest of San Francisco, believes that the pandemic gave sellers of all ages a heightened sense of their role in the community and that the return of Trump to the White House added new urgency. Sales are up 20% this year, he says, if only because \u201cduring tough times, people come to bookstores.\u201d",
      "The younger owners bring with them a wide range of prior experience. Salazar had worked in retail management for nine years, switched to property and casualty insurance sales \u201cin search of advancement opportunity\u201d and, right before she launched her store, was a business process owner, \u201ca blend of project management, customer and employee experience management.\u201d",
      "Courtney Bledsoe, owner of Call & Response, had been a corporate attorney before undertaking a \u201cfull career shift\u201d and risking a substantial drop in income. The 30-year-old held no illusions that owning a store meant \u201cpouring a cup of coffee and reading all day.\u201d Calling herself \u201crisk averse,\u201d she researched the book retail business as if preparing for a trial, before committing herself and launching Call & Response in May 2024.",
      "\u201cThis endeavor is probably the hardest thing I have ever done in my life,\u201d she says, acknowledging it could take a couple of years before she can even pay herself a salary. \u201cWe're just doing this to serve the community, doing something we love to do, providing people with great events, great reading. It's been a real joy.\u201d",

      "A Thai court has ordered exiled former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to pay more than $304 million to compensate for losses incurred by a money-losing rice farming subsidy program that her government had implemented more than a decade ago",
      "BANGKOK -- A Thai court on Thursday ordered exiled former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to pay more than 10 billion baht ($304 million) to compensate for losses incurred by a money-losing rice farming subsidy program that her administration had implemented more than a decade ago.",
      "The Supreme Administrative Court partially reversed a 2021 court ruling that cleared her. It found her guilty of severe negligence in relation to rice sales to other countries and said she failed to act on many government agencies\u2019 warnings of possible corruption.",
      "She was ordered to pay half of the damages estimated at more than 20 billion baht ($608 million). The court annulled a 2016 order by the Finance Ministry for her to pay 35.7 billion baht ($1.1 billion) in compensation, saying Yingluck was not proven directly responsible for the alleged corruption.",
      "The rice subsidy program was a flagship policy that helped Yingluck\u2019s Pheu Thai Party win the 2011 general election. Under the program, the government paid farmers about 50% more than they would have received on the global market, with the intention of driving up prices by warehousing the grain.",
      "But other rice-producing countries captured the international rice market by selling at competitive prices. Thailand as a result lost its position as the world\u2019s leading rice exporter and large amounts of rice sat unsold in government warehouses.",
      "After the ruling, Yingluck posted on her Facebook page that she had no intention to cause damages and was being held responsible \u201cfor a debt I did not cause.\u201d",
      "Her lawyer Norrawit Larlaeng said her legal team plans to request a retrial. He said that the government had already sold the leftover rice from the subsidy program for around 200 billion baht ($6.08 billion), which covers all damages estimated by the Finance Ministry.",
      "Yingluck, the first female prime minister of Thailand, came to power in 2011, five years after her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was toppled in a coup and fled abroad. Yingluck also was forced out by a military coup in 2014, and fled the country in 2017, ahead of a court verdict. She's been living in exile since then.",
      "Thaksin, a highly popular but divisive political figure, returned home in 2023 before being granted clemency in a corruption trial because of his age and health.",
      "Thailand's current Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra is Thaksin's daughter.",
      "Last year, Yingluck was cleared by a court on unrelated charges of mishandling funds for a government project in 2013. In December 2023, the court also cleared her of abuse of power in connection with a personnel transfer she had overseen.",

      "House Republicans have taken a major step forward on President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans early Thursday took a major step forward on President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, approving a legislative package that combines tax breaks, spending cuts, border security funding and other priorities.",
      "House committees labored for months on the bill, which underwent late changes to win over holdouts in the Republican conference. It exceeds 1,000 pages and is titled the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d a nod to Trump himself.",
      "Republicans made one last round of revisions before the bill reached the House floor, boosting the state and local tax deduction to win over centrists and speeding up the work requirements in Medicaid to win over those who didn\u2019t believe the bill did enough to curb spending.",
      "Here's a look at what's in the legislative package, which is expected to undergo more changes when it goes to the Senate.",
      "Republicans look to make permanent the individual income and estate tax cuts passed in Trump\u2019s first term, in 2017, plus enact promises he made on the 2024 campaign trail to not tax tips, overtime and interest on some auto loans.",
      "To partially offset the lost revenue, Republicans propose repealing or phasing out more quickly the clean energy tax credits passed during Joe Biden's presidency, helping to bring down the overall cost of the tax portion to about $3.8 trillion.",
      "The bill includes a temporary boost in the standard deduction \u2014 a $1,000 increase for individuals, bringing it to $16,000 for individual filers, and a $2,000 boost for joint filers, bringing it to $32,000. The deduction reduces the amount of income that is actually subject to income tax.",
      "There is also a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 for 2025 through 2028. It then returns to $2,000 and will increase to account for inflation.",
      "The estate tax exemption rises to $15 million and is adjusted for inflation going forward.",
      "One of the thorniest issues in negotiations had been how much to raise the state and local tax deduction, now capped at $10,000. That's been a priority of New York lawmakers. The bill increases the \u201cSALT\u201d cap to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000, with the cap phasing downward for those with higher incomes. Also, the cap and income threshold will increase 1% annually over 10 years.",
      "Several of the provisions Trump promised in the campaign would be temporary, lasting roughly through his term in office. The tax breaks for tips, overtime and car loan interest expire at the end of 2028. That's also the case for a $4,000 increase in the standard deduction for seniors.",
      "Among the various business tax provisions, small businesses, including partnerships and S corporations, will be able to subtract 23% of their qualified business income from their taxes. The deduction has been 20%",
      "Businesses will temporarily be allowed to fully expense domestic research and development costs in the year they occur and the cost of machinery, equipment and other qualifying assets. This encourages businesses to invest in ways that enhances their productivity.",
      "House Republicans would reduce spending on food aid, what is known as the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, by about $267 billion over 10 years.",
      "States would shoulder 5% of benefit costs, beginning in fiscal 2028, and 75% of the administrative costs. Currently, states pay none of the benefit and half of the administration costs.",
      "Republicans also are expanding the work requirements to receive food aid. Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents must fulfill work requirements until they are 54, and that would change under the bill to age 64.",
      "Also, some parents are currently exempt from work requirements until their children are 18; that would change so only those caring for a dependent child under the age of 7 are exempt.",
      "A focal point of the package is nearly $700 billion in reduced spending in the Medicaid program, according to CBO.",
      "To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new \u201ccommunity engagement requirements\u201d of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. The new requirements would begin on Dec. 31, 2026. People would also have to verify their eligibility for the program twice a year, rather than just once.",
      "Republicans are looking to generate savings with new work requirements. But Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage.",
      "A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "Republicans are also using the package to reward allies and disadvantage political foes.",
      "The package would eliminate a $200 tax on gun silencers that has existed since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934. The elimination of the tax is supported by the NRA.",
      "The group Giffords, which works to reduce gun violence, said silencers make it more difficult to recognize the sound of gunfire and locate the source of gunshots, impairing the ability of law enforcement to respond to active shooters.",
      "Republicans are also looking to prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion care. Democrats say defunding the organization would make it harder for millions of patients to get cancer screenings, pap tests and birth control.",
      "The bill originally called for \u201cMAGA\u201d accounts, shorthand for Trump's signature line, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d But in a last-minute revision, the bill changed the name to \u201cTrump\u201d accounts.",
      "For parents or guardians who open new \u201cTrump\u201d accounts for their children, the federal government will contribute $1,000 for babies born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028.",
      "Families could add $5,000 a year, with the account holders unable to take distributions before age 18. Then, they could access up to 50% of the money to pay for higher education, training and first-time home purchases. At age 30, account holders have access to the full balance of the account for any purpose.",
      "The legislation would provide $46.5 billion to revive construction of Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and more money for the deportation agenda.",
      "There's $4 billion to hire an additional 3,000 new Border Patrol agents as well as 5,000 new customs officers, and $2.1 billion for signing and retention bonuses. There's also funds for 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.",
      "It includes major changes to immigration policy, imposing a $1,000 fee on migrants seeking asylum \u2014 something the nation has never done, putting it on par with few others, including Australia and Iran.",
      "Overall, the plan is to remove 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers.",
      "There's also nearly with $150 billion in new money for the Defense Department and national security.",
      "It would provide $25 billion for Trump's \u201cGolden Dome for America,\u201d a long-envisioned missile defense shield, $21 billion to restock the nation's ammunition arsenal, $34 billion to expand the naval fleet with more shipbuilding and some $5 billion for border security.",
      "It also includes $9 billion for servicemember quality of life-related issues, including housing, health care and special pay.",
      "A wholesale revamping of the student loan program is key to the legislation, providing $330 billion in budget cuts and savings.",
      "The proposal would replace all existing student loan repayment plans with just two: a standard option with monthly payments spread out over 10 to 25 years and a \u201crepayment assistance\u201d plan that is generally less generous than those it would replace.",
      "Among other changes, the bill would repeal Biden-era regulations that made it easier for borrowers to get loans canceled if their colleges defrauded them or closed suddenly.",
      "There would be a tax increase, up to 21%, on some university endowments.",
      "To generate revenue, one section would allow increased leasing of public lands for drilling, mining and logging while clearing the path for more development by speeding up government approvals.",
      "Royalty rates paid by companies to extract oil, gas and coal would be cut, reversing Biden\u2019s attempts to curb fossil fuels to help address climate change.",

      "The Office for National Statistics said the figure stood at an estimated 431,000 in the year, down 49.9% from 860,000 a year earlier. That's the biggest percentage decline since the height of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, and the largest numerical drop for any 12-month period.",
      "Britain has relied on people coming into the country legally to contribute to economic growth, certainly in the decades after World War II, when millions arrived to help rebuild the country. And for years, it wasn't much of a political issue and on the periphery of debate.",
      "But it has become a politically toxic issue over the past 20 years or so, and played a key role in the Brexit vote of 2016, when Britain voted to leave the European Union. Membership of the EU comes with the obligation to offer free movement to all citizens of the 27-country bloc.",
      "But immigration figures have gone up, not down, post-Brexit.",
      "The anti-immigration party Reform U.K. won big in recent local elections and is ahead in many opinion polls. Its argument is that too-high immigration is impacting on public services, housing and societal cohesion as a whole.",
      "The figures released Thursday do not include those arriving in the U.K. by unauthorized means to seek asylum, many in flimsy, small boats across the English Channel. Though that number is far lower \u2014 some 37,000 people crossed the English Channel on small boats last year \u2014 it's amplified the heat surrounding the debate.",
      "A more detailed look at Thursday's figures shows that the biggest contributor to the fall was a sharp decline in immigration, with the number of people coming into the U.K. below 1 million for the first time in around three years. However, the statistics agency also found that emigration swelled back to 2017 levels.",
      "The number of arrivals in the U.K. surged from 2022 onward, driven by many factors, including the more than 200,000 people fleeing Russia's war in Ukraine and more than 150,000 from Hong Kong on special overseas visas.",
      "The period covered by the latest estimates follows the introduction in early 2024 by the then Conservative government of restrictions on people eligible to travel to the U.K. on work or study visas. Though the Conservatives, now the main opposition party, have sought to claim credit for the decline, one of the main reasons they were swept from power after 14 years was the increase in net migration levels to record highs.",
      "In August, weeks after the Labour government took office, the country was convulsed by anti-immigration riots in which mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers were attacked.",
      "Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer is seeking to get net migration levels down further and earlier this month set out a series of measures aimed at reducing further the number of people moving long term to the U.K.",

      "PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia -- The civil war in Myanmar, maritime disputes in the South China Sea and U.S. tariff hikes will top the agenda of a two-day Southeast Asian summit next week, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said.",
      "The meeting in Malaysia, the current chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, on Monday will be followed by a summit on Tuesday with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The GCC already has strong links with the U.S. and \u201cwants to be close to China too,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cWe want to have that synergy to enhance trade investments, more effective collaboration,\u201d Anwar said in a media briefing late Wednesday.",
      "ASEAN countries, many which rely on exports to the U.S., have been hit by U.S. tariffs ranging from 10% to 49%. U.S. President Donald Trump last month announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs, prompting countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam to swiftly begin trade negotiations with Washington.",
      "Anwar said the U.S. has promised to review Malaysia's case \u201csympathetically.\u201d He said ASEAN is also working together to see how it can negotiate with the U.S. as a bloc. At the same time, he said that ASEAN must build its economic resilience by deepening links with other partners such as China, India and the European Union.",
      "Anwar said the U.S.-China rivalry would not split the bloc as the region continues to engage both superpowers. He also downplayed territorial disputes between ASEAN members and China in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety, and Myanmar's conflict since the 2021 military takeover.",
      "Anwar met last month with Myanmar military chief Gen. Ming Aung Hlaing in Bangkok and held virtual talks with the opposition National Unity Government. Even though the talks were focused on humanitarian aid following a devastating earthquake in March that killed more than 3,700 people, Anwar said he hopes they could eventually push a peace process forward.",
      "Min Aung Hlaing has been barred from attending ASEAN meetings after the military refused to comply with ASEAN\u2019s peace plan, which includes delivery of humanitarian aid and negotiations. Opponents and critics of the military government say aid is not freely allowed into areas not under the army\u2019s control, and accuse the army of violating its self-declared ceasefire with dozens of airstrikes.",

      "It seems like a triumph for a cryptocurrency industry that\u2019s sought mainstream acceptance: Top investors in one of President Donald Trump\u2019s crypto projects invited to dine with him at his luxury golf club in Northern Virginia on the heels of the Senate...",
      "WASHINGTON -- It seems like a triumph for a cryptocurrency industry that has long sought mainstream acceptance: Top investors in one of President Donald Trump \u2019s crypto projects invited to dine with him at his luxury golf club in Northern Virginia on the heels of the Senate advancing key pro-crypto legislation and while bitcoin prices soar.",
      "But Thursday night\u2019s dinner for the 220 biggest investors in the $TRUMP meme coin has raised uncomfortable questions about potentially shadowy buyers using the anonymity of the internet to buy access to the president.",
      "While Democrats charge that Trump is using the power of the presidency to boost profits for his family business, even some pro-Trump crypto enthusiasts worry that the president\u2019s push into meme coins isn't helping their efforts to establish the credibility, stability and legitimacy they had thought his administration would bring to their businesses.",
      "After feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, the industry has quickly become a dominant political force, donating huge sums to help Trump and crypto-friendly lawmakers. But that's also served to tether the industry \u2014 sometimes uncomfortably \u2014 to a president who is using crypto as a platform to make money for his brand in unprecedented ways.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s distasteful and an unnecessary distraction,\u201d said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter and partner at the crypto investment firm Castle Island Ventures, who said the president is \u201chugging us to death\u201d with his private crypto businesses. \u201cWe would much rather that he passes common-sense legislation and leave it at that.\u201d",
      "At the swanky Crypto Ball held down the street from the White House three days before he took office on Jan. 20, Trump announced the creation of the meme coin $TRUMP as a way for his supporters to \u201chave fun.\u201d",
      "Meme coins are the crypto sector\u2019s black sheep. They are often created as a joke, with no real utility and prone to extremely wild price swings that tend to enrich a small group of insiders at the expense of less sophisticated investors.",
      "The president's meme coin is different, however, and has a clear utility: access to Trump. The top 25 investors of $TRUMP are set to attend a private reception with the president Thursday, with the top four getting $100,000 crypto-themed and Trump-branded watches.",
      "Trump\u2019s meme coin saw an initial spike in value, followed by a steep drop. The price saw a significant increase after the dinner contest was announced. Its creators, which include an entity controlled by the Trump Organization, have made hundreds of millions of dollars by collecting fees on trades.",
      "First lady Melania Trump has her own meme coin, and Trump\u2019s sons, Eric and Don Jr. \u2014 who are running the Trump Organization while their father is president \u2014 announced they are partnering with an existing firm to create a crypto mining company.",
      "The Trump family also holds about a 60% stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that provides yet another avenue where investors are buying in and enriching the president\u2019s relatives. World Liberty has launched its own stablecoin, USD1. The project got a boost recently when World Liberty announced an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A rapidly growing form of crypto, stablecoins have values pegged to fixed assets like the U.S. dollar. Issuers profit by collecting the interest on the Treasury bonds and other assets used to back the stablecoins.",
      "Crypto is now one of the most significant sources of the Trump family\u2019s wealth.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s becoming a salesman-in-chief,\u201d said James Thurber, an American University professor emeritus who has long studied and taught about corruption around the world. \u201cIt allows for foreign influence easily. It allows for crypto lobbying going on at this dinner, and other ways. It allows for huge conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big crypto fan,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One during last week\u2019s trip to the Middle East. \u201cI\u2019ve been that from the beginning, right from the campaign.\u201d",
      "That wasn\u2019t always true. During his first term, Trump posted in July 2019 that cryptocurrencies were \u201cnot money\u201d and had value that was \u201chighly volatile and based on thin air.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade,\u201d he added then. Even after leaving office in 2021, Trump told Fox Business Network that bitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, \u201cseems like a scam.\u201d",
      "Trump began to shift during a crypto event at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in May 2024, receiving assurances that industry backers would spend lavishly to get him reelected. Another major milestone came last June, when Trump attended a high-dollar fundraiser at the San Francisco home of David Sacks.",
      "He further warmed to the industry weeks later, when Trump met at Mar-a-Lago with bitcoin miners. The following month, he addressed a major crypto conference in Nashville, promising to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet.\u201d",
      "Those close to Trump, including his sons and billionaire Elon Musk, helped further push his embrace of the industry. Sacks is now the Trump administration\u2019s crypto czar, and many Cabinet members \u2014 including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 have long been enthusiastic crypto boosters.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have faith in the dollar,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a 2023 interview. \u201cI\u2019m bullish on bitcoin.\u201d",
      "Many top crypto backers were naturally wary of traditional politics, but gravitated toward Trump last year. They bristled at Democratic President Joe Biden 's Securities and Exchange Commission aggressively bringing civil suits against several major crypto companies.",
      "Since Trump took office, many such cases have been dropped or paused, including one alleging that Justin Sun, a China-born crypto entrepreneur, and his company engaged in market manipulation and paid celebrities for undisclosed promotions.",
      "Sun, who once paid $6.2 million for a piece of art involving a banana taped to a wall, and then ate the banana, helped the Trumps start World Liberty Financial with an early $75 million investment.",
      "Sun has disclosed on social media that he is the biggest holder of $TRUMP meme coins and is attending Thursday\u2019s dinner.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry,\u201d Sun said.",
      "Trump has signed executive orders promoting the industry, including calls to create a government bitcoin reserve. In March, Trump convened the first cryptocurrency summit at the White House.",
      "But some of the industry\u2019s biggest names, often brash and outspoken, have kept mostly mum on Trump\u2019s meme coins and other projects.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to really comment on President Trump\u2019s activity,\u201d Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said at a recent public event.",
      "Meanwhile, a top legislative priority for crypto-backers, a bill clarifying how digital assets are to be regulated, has advanced in the Senate. But some Democrats have tried to stall other pro-crypto legislation over the president's personal dealings.",
      "\u201cNever in American history has a sitting president so blatantly violated the ethics laws,\u201d Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts said during a contentious House hearing earlier this month.",
      "The White House referred questions about dinner attendees to the Trump Organization, which didn't provide a list of who is coming.",
      "\u201cThe President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself,\u201d White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said in a statement.",
      "In addition to Sun, however, some attendees have publicized qualifying for the dinner. Another will be Sheldon Xia, the founder of a cryptocurrency exchange called BitMart that\u2019s registered in the Cayman Islands.",
      "\u201cProud to support President Trump\u2019s pro-crypto vision.\u201d Xia wrote in both English and Chinese on social media.",
      "Thurber, the expert on government and ethics, said Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal attention to crypto at this dinner helps the crypto industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut also it\u2019s risky,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they could all lose a lot of money.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "It\u2019s crunch time for the maker of Levi\u2019s and Wrangler jeans in Kenya\u2019s capital",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- It's crunch time for the maker of Levi's and Wrangler jeans in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi. Hundreds of sewing machines whir in a crowded, air-conditioned factory. On another floor, workers pack clothes destined for the U.S. market.",
      "The fate of about 16,000 workers in the factory at the United Aryan export processing zone hangs in the balance. In September, a duty-free trade agreement between Kenya and the United States could expire under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA.",
      "The factory's founder, Pankaj Bedi, said manufacturers would be unable to compete well in the U.S. market if the AGOA agreement is not renewed, due to the difficult business environment in sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Without AGOA \u2014 meant to benefit African nations that meet certain U.S. expectations in areas including governance and human rights \u2014 many Kenyan goods would no longer have duty-free access to the U.S. market. And they would be exposed to the uncertainty of the Trump administration\u2019s global tariff campaign.",
      "It's a concern across the continent. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking to journalists after his Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump, noted that AGOA is \u201cgoing to be further discussed ... it is top of mind for them as well\u201d in the U.S. administration.",
      "Bedi said his business has benefited from 25 years of the AGOA agreement but will not survive if the deal is not extended again.",
      "\u201cThis time around, we are hoping that President Trump will pass it for a longer period, then a long-term strategy can come in play,\" he said. The longest extension has been for a decade.",
      "In making his pitch, Bedi said he believes that Africa offers the perfect alternative sourcing to Asia with its large and youthful workforce. Seventy percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa are under 30, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cI think the real shift of supply chain will happen, and Africa is the last frontier. We cannot go to the moon and start manufacturing there,\" Bedi said.",
      "Kenya\u2019s government would not comment on the deal or why it might be under threat.",
      "Economist Wangari Muikia said the new U.S. tariffs reflect a shift towards reviving American manufacturing, \u201cconsistent with Trump\u2019s priority to re-shore jobs,\u201d but warned that ending AGOA may \u201cstrain diplomatic ties and weaken American soft power.\u201d",
      "African governments have promoted AGOA as a major job creation avenue.",
      "In Kenya, AGOA has led to the creation of 66,000 jobs since the program began in 2000, according to government statistics published in 2024. Kenya\u2019s overall unemployment rate is 12.7%, but the rate among those under 35 is 67% \u2014 part of a wider issue for much of Africa\u2019s booming young population.",
      "In 2023, Kenya\u2019s total exports under AGOA including agricultural products, apparel and handicrafts were worth $510 million, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. United Aryan said it exports an average of 8 million jeans annually from Kenya to the U.S.",
      "But some African governments and leaders have objected to AGOA's conditions. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni criticized the program after it was used in 2023 to pressure him on his stance on homosexuality.",
      "Kenya\u2019s former ambassador to the U.N., Martin Kimani, said in an interview with The Associated Press that he believes AGOA\u2019s unpredictability has not been good for the economy.",
      "\u201cThe real measure of a trade regime is its predictability and its integration into long-term production,\" he said. \u201cThe tariffs and the program\u2019s upcoming expiration signal that AGOA is not a stable foundation for African industrial growth.\u201d",
      "If Kenya\u2019s AGOA deal isn\u2019t extended, the country will need to look for alternative markets like the African Continental Free Trade Area to ensure jobs are not lost and manufacturers keep exporting goods, said economist James Shikwati, founder and director of The Inter Region Economic Network.",
      "The continental free trade area has shortcomings that include underdeveloped infrastructure that makes it expensive to transport goods, mistrust that makes it hard for some countries to be fully open to trading with neighbors and a lack of strong institutions that can mediate trade disputes.",
      "Judging by the Trump administration\u2019s recent trade-related policies, every trade partner will need to reevaluate its engagement with the U.S., Shikwati added.",
      "For those whose jobs could be affected, there is concern.",
      "United Aryan employee Valdes Samora hopes to keep the sewing machines humming, and that livelihoods will not be lost after September.",
      "The 59-year-old father of nine has been working at the company for two decades. His wife also works there. Workers are paid an average of $200 per month, in a country where the minimum wage is $115.",

      "Republicans have made several late changes to their tax cut and immigration bill",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans made several eleventh-hour changes to their massive tax cut and immigration bill as they tried to win over GOP holdouts and pass the bill through the House.",
      "The revisions were unveiled late Wednesday evening, just before the House launched into an all-night session to debate and vote on the bill. President Donald Trump has urged Republicans to get behind the legislation, which enacts some of his campaign promises.",
      "If the bill clears the House, it would move to the Senate for further consideration.",
      "Among the changes that House Republicans made:",
      "\u2014 They removed the sections that authorized the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in Nevada and Utah. Some Republican lawmakers from Western states had objected to the sales.",
      "\u2014 They changed the name of the new investment accounts that parents or guardians could open with a $1,000 contribution from the federal government for babies born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028. Instead of being named \u201cMAGA\u201d accounts, they will be named \u201cTrump\u201d accounts.",
      "\u2014 They accelerated the implementation of a new work requirement for certain able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries to Dec. 31, 2026. The work requirement had been set to begin on Jan. 1, 2029. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the original date for the work requirements was meant to give states adequate time to get new systems in place, but some Republicans objected, saying the work requirements needed to start more quickly.",
      "\u2014 The revised bill quadruples the cap on the state and local tax deduction to $40,000 for households with incomes up to $500,000, with the deduction gradually phasing down for taxpayers above that income threshold. Also, the cap and income threshold will increase 1% annually over 10 years, which is generally below the rate of inflation. Increasing what is known as the SALT cap was a big issue that divided the Republican conference. The current cap is $10,000. GOP leaders agreed to a higher amount to win over support from Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California.",
      "\u2014 A new provision in the bill deregulates gun silencers by removing them from the national registry regulated under the National Firearms Act. The registry contains information on machine guns, certain short-barreled rifles and shotguns and silencers. The bill already looked to remove a $200 excise tax on silencers.",
      "\u2014 Republicans removed a section of the bill that would change the calculations for federal workers' retirement pensions. Annuities will continue to be based on the average of the highest three years of income. The GOP had been looking to save money by changing the calculation so that it would be based on a worker's highest five years of income.",
      "\u2014 The bill creates a $12 billion fund for the Homeland Security secretary to provide grants to reimburse states for costs of detention and removal of migrants and other border security efforts.",
      "\u2014 The legislation accelerates the Inflation Reduction Act tax credit phaseout for wind, solar and battery storage to 2028.",

      "Senate Republicans have voted to establish a new precedent that will allow them to roll back clean air standards in California, including a rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Wednesday voted to establish a new precedent that will allow them to roll back vehicle emission standards in California, including a rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The winding series of Senate procedural votes that went late into the evening could have profound implications for California\u2019s longstanding efforts to reduce air pollution. It also established a new, narrow exception to the Senate filibuster even as Republicans have insisted that they won\u2019t try to change Senate rules.",
      "Democrats strongly objected to the move, delaying the votes for hours as Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way procedurally for Republicans to bring up three House-passed resolutions that would block the rules. The Senate could pass the resolutions later this week.",
      "At issue are the three California rules \u2014 phasing out gas-powered cars, cutting tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and curbing smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "Republicans say the phase out of gas-powered cars, along with the other rules, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation\u2019s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate. Democrats charge that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and say that California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Thune said this week that the waivers \u201cgo far beyond the scope Congress contemplated in the Clean Air Act\u201d and said they \u201cendanger consumers, our economy and our nation\u2019s energy supply.\u201d",
      "Also at issue is the Senate as an institution, and longstanding filibuster rules that both parties have rolled back over the last two decades. While the Republicans\u2019 effort is narrow, it is one of several increasingly partisan efforts to push legislation through the Senate on party-line votes.",
      "Through the series of votes Wednesday, Republicans set precedent for the Senate to reject the state EPA waivers with a simple majority vote. They made that move even after the Senate parliamentarian agreed with the Government Accountability Office that California\u2019s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances.",
      "\u201cRepublicans tonight cross a point of no return for the Senate, expanding what this chamber can do at a majority threshold,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor as he moved to delay the votes. He called the Republicans \u201cfair-weather institutionalists.\u201d",
      "Both parties have made major moves to roll back the filibuster \u2014 which requires a 60-vote threshold \u2014 in recent years.",
      "Democrats voted in 2013, under President Barack Obama, to lower the vote threshold to a simple majority for all presidential nominees, with the exception of the Supreme Court. In 2017, during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, Republicans rolled back the remaining filibuster rules to confirm Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a rule that Democrats maintained in confirming Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022. That same year, Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to roll back the legislative filibuster but were thwarted by some in their own party who opposed the move.",
      "Republicans have argued this week that they are simply reinforcing Senate rules, and federal laws, that are already in place.",
      "\u201cWe are not talking about doing anything to erode the institutional character of the Senate; in fact, we are talking about preserving the Senate\u2019s prerogatives,\" Thune said.",
      "The votes to roll back California standards come after years of Republican efforts to block them. The Trump administration in 2019 revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its own emissions standards, but President Joe Biden later restored the state\u2019s authority.",
      "Republicans have argued that the rules effectively dictate standards for the whole country, imposing what would eventually be a nationwide electric vehicle mandate. Around a dozen states have already followed California\u2019s lead.",
      "California for decades has been given the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government\u2019s. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.",
      "The Biden administration approved the state\u2019s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.",
      "Biden\u2019s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.",
      "Newsom has evoked Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who signed landmark environmental laws, as he has fought congressional Republicans and the Trump administration on the issue.",
      "\u201cThe United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,\u201d he said this week.",

      "Tech and music industry leaders testified about the dangers of deepfakes made with artificial intelligence on Wednesday, urging lawmakers to pass legislation that would protect people's voices and likenesses from being replicated without consent, while allowing use of the tech responsibly.",
      "Speaking to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on privacy, technology, and the law, executives from YouTube and Recording Industry Association of America as well as country music singer Martina McBride, championed the bipartisan No Fakes Act, which seeks to create federal protections for artists\u2019 voice, likeness and image from unauthorized AI-generated deepfakes.",
      "The group argued that Americans across the board \u2014 whether teenagers or high-profile music artists \u2014 were at risk of their likenesses being misused. The legislation, reintroduced in the senate last month, would combat deepfakes by holding individuals or companies liable if they produced an unauthorized digital replica of an individual in a performance.",
      "\u201cAI technology is amazing and can be used for so many wonderful purposes,\u201d McBride told the panel. \u201cBut like all great technologies, it can also be abused, in this case by stealing people\u2019s voices and likenesses to scare and defraud families, manipulate the images of young girls in ways that are shocking to say the least, impersonate government officials, or make phony recordings posing as artists like me.\u201d",
      "The No Fakes Act would also hold platforms liable if they knew a replica was not authorized, while excluding certain digital replicas from coverage based on First Amendment protections. It would also establish a notice-and-takedown process so victims of unauthorized deepfakes \u201chave an avenue to get online platforms to take down the deepfake,\u201d the bill's sponsors said last month.",
      "The bill would address the use of non-consensual digital replicas in audiovisual works, images, or sound recordings.",
      "Nearly 400 artists, actors and performers have signed on in support of the legislation, according to the Human Artistry Campaign, which advocates for responsible AI use, including LeAnn Rimes, Bette Midler, Missy Elliott, Scarlett Johansson and Sean Astin.",
      "The testimony comes two days after President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act, bipartisan legislation that enacted stricter penalties for the distribution of non-consensual intimate imagery, sometimes called \u201crevenge porn,\u201d as well as deepfakes created by AI.",
      "Mitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA, said that the No Fakes act is \u201cthe perfect next step to build on\u201d that law.",
      "\u201cIt provides a remedy to victims of invasive harms that go beyond the intimate images addressed by that legislation, protecting artists like Martina from non-consensual deepfakes and voice clones that breach the trust she has built with millions of fans,\u201d he said, adding that it \u201cempowers individuals to have unlawful deepfakes removed as soon as a platform is able without requiring anyone to hire lawyers or go to court.\u201d",
      "Suzana Carlos, head of music policy at YouTube, added that the bill would protect the credibility of online content. AI regulation should not penalize companies for providing tools that can be used for permitted and non-permitted uses, she said in written testimony, prior to addressing the subcommittee.",
      "The legislation offers a workable, tech-neutral and comprehensive legal solution, she said, and would streamline global operations for platforms like YouTube while empowering musicians and rights holders to manage their IP. Platforms have a responsibility to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content, she added.",
      "\u201cYouTube largely supports this bill because we see the incredible opportunity to of AI, but we also recognize those harms, and we believe that AI needs to be deployed responsibly,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Short-term lender Klarna says more customers are having trouble repaying their \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d loans",
      "NEW YORK -- More Klarna customers are having trouble repaying their \u201cbuy now, pay later\" loans, the short-term lender said this week. The disclosure corresponded with reports by lending platforms Bankrate and LendingTree, which cited an increasing share of all \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d users saying they had fallen behind on payments.",
      "The late or missed installments are a sign of faltering financial health among a segment of the US population, some analysts say, as the nation's total consumer debt rises to a record $18.2 trillion and the Trump administration moves to collect on federal student loans.",
      "Shoppers who opt to finance purchases through BNPL services tend to be younger than the average consumer, and a study from the Federal Reserve last year said Black and Hispanic women were especially likely to use the plans, which customers of all income levels are increasingly adopting.",
      "\u201cWhile BNPL provides credit to financially vulnerable consumers, these same consumers may be overextending themselves,\u201d the authors of the Federal Reserve study wrote. \u201cThis concern is consistent with previous research that has shown consumers spend more when BNPL is offered when checking out and that BNPL use leads to an increase in overdraft fees and credit card interest payments and fees.\"",
      "As Klarna grows its user base and revenue, the Swedish company said its first-quarter consumer credit losses rose 17% compared to the January-March period of last year, to $136 million.",
      "A company spokesperson said in a statement that the increase largely reflected the higher number of loans Klarna made year over year. The percentage of its loans at a global level that went unpaid in the first quarter grew from 0.51% in 2024 to 0.54% this year, and the company sees \u201cno sign of a weakened U.S. consumer,\u201d he said.",
      "Buy now, pay later plans generally let consumers split payments for purchases into four or fewer installments, often with a down payment at checkout. The loans are typically marketed as zero-interest, and most require no credit check or a soft credit check.",
      "BNPL providers promote the plans as a safer alternative to traditional credit cards when interest rates are high. The popularity of the deferred payment plans, and the expanding ways customers can use them, have also sparked public attention.",
      "When Klarna announced a partnership with DoorDash in March, the news led to online comments about Americans taking out loans to buy takeout food. Similar skepticism emerged when Billboard revealed that more than half of Coachella attendees used installment plans to finance their tickets to the music festival.",
      "An April report from LendingTree said about four in ten users of buy now, pay later plans said they had made late payments in the past year, up from one in three last year. According to a May report from Bankrate, about one in four users of the loans chose them because they were easier to get than traditional credit cards.",
      "The six largest BNPL providers \u2014 Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, Sezzle, and Zip \u2014 originated about 277.3 million loans for $33.8 billion in merchandise in 2022, or an amount equal to about 1% of credit card spending that year, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The federal agency said this month it did not intend to enforce a Biden-era regulation that was designed to put more boundaries around the fintech lenders.",
      "The rule treated buy now, pay later loans like traditional credit cards under the Truth In Lending Act, requiring disclosures, refund processing, a formal dispute process and other protections.",
      "The regulation, which took effect last year, also prevented borrowers from being forced into automatic payments or charged with multiple fees for the same missed payment.",
      "The Trump administration said its non-enforcement decision came \u201cin the interest of focusing resources on supporting hard-working American taxpayers\u201d and that it would \u201cinstead keep its enforcement and supervision resources focused on pressing threats to consumers, particularly servicemen and veterans.\u201d",
      "Consumer advocates maintain that without federal oversight, customers seeking refunds or in search of clear information about BNPL fee structures and interest rates will have less legal recourse.",
      "Industry watchers point to consumers taking out loans they can't afford to pay back as a top risk of BNPL use. Without credit bureaus keeping track of the new form of credit, there are fewer safeguards and less oversight.",
      "Justine Farrell, chair of the marketing department at the University of San Diego\u2019s Knauss School of Business, said that when consumers aren't able to make loan payments on time, it worsens the economic stress they're already experiencing.",
      "\u201cConsumers\u2019 financial positions feel more spread thin than they have in a long time,\u201d said Farrell, who studies consumer behavior and BNPL services. \u201cThe cost of food is continuing to go up, on top of rent and other goods ... so consumers are taking advantage of the ability to pay for items later.\"",
      "The Consumer Federation of America and other watchdog organizations have expressed concern about the rollback of BNPL regulation as the use of the loans continues to rise.",
      "\u201cBy taking a head-in-the-sand approach to the new universe of fintech loans, the new CFPB is once again favoring Big Tech at the expense of everyday people,\u201d said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve states on Wednesday urged a federal court to strike down President Donald Trump's sweeping taxes on imports, saying he had exceeded his authority, left U.S. trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashed economic chaos.",
      "They are challenging tariffs that Trump imposed last month on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America's massive and longstanding trade deficits. They are also targeting levies the president had earlier plastered on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the U.S. border.",
      "A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York on Wednesday heard arguments in the states\u2019 case. Last week, the trade court held a hearing in a similar challenge to Trump\u2019s tariffs brought by five small businesses.",
      "The court specifically deals with civil lawsuits involving international trade. Its decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington and ultimately to the Supreme Court, where the legal challenges to Trump\u2019 tariffs are widely expected to end up.",
      "At least seven lawsuits are challenging the levies, the centerpiece of Trump's trade policy.",
      "Declaring that the United States\u2019 trade deficits add up to a national emergency, Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEPPA) and rolled out 10% tariffs on many countries on April 2 \u2014 \"Liberation Day,'' he called it. He imposed stiffer \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 tariffs of up to 50% on countries that sell more goods to the United States than the U.S. sells them. (Trump later suspended those higher tariffs for 90 days.)",
      "The states argue that the emergency economic powers act does not authorize the use of tariffs. Even if it did, they say, the trade deficit does not meet the law's requirement that an emergency be triggered only by an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat.'' The U.S. has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years. \u201cThis is not an unusual problem,\u2019\u2019 Brian Marshall, an Oregon state attorney, told the judges Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration argues that courts approved President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the language used in IEPPA.",
      "Brett Shumate, the assistant U.S. attorney general representing the administration, argued Wednesday that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the \u201cpolitical'' question of whether the president's rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law. That argument led Judge Jane Restani to ask if courts were helpless to block the president's emergency declarations no matter how \u201dcrazy'' they were.",
      "Trump's Liberation Day tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for U.S. economic growth. So far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world's largest economy.",
      "The 12 states pursuing the case are Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont.",

      "Sales at Target fell more than expected in the first quarter and the retailer warned they will slip for all of 2025 year as its customers, worried over the impact of tariffs and the economy, pull back on spending",
      "NEW YORK -- Sales at Target fell more than expected in the first quarter, and the retailer warned they will slip for all of 2025 year as its customers, worried over the impact of tariffs and the economy, pull back on spending.",
      "Target also said that customer boycotts have also done some damage during the latest quarter. The company scaled back many diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in January after they came under attack by conservative activists and the White House. Target's retreat created another backlash, with more customers angered by the retailer's reduction of LGBTQ+-themed merchandise for Pride Month in June of 2023.",
      "Shares fell 3% before the opening bell Wednesday.",
      "Sales fell 2.8% to $23.85 billion in the quarter, and that was short of the $24.23 billion Wall Street expected, according to FactSet. Sales are also down from the $24.53 billion the company reported during the same period last year.",
      "Target cut its annual sales projections Wednesday. The company now expects a low-single digit decline for 2025 after projecting a 1% increase for sales in March.",
      "It also forecast annual per-share earnings of $7 to $9, excluding gains from legal settlements this year.",
      "For the year, analysts expect earnings per share of $8.34 on sales of $106.7 billion.",
      "Comparable store sales, those from established stores and online channels, fell 3.8%. That includes a 5.7% drop in store sales and a 4.7% increase in online sales. That reverses a comparable store sales increase of 1.5% in the previous quarter.",
      "The number of transactions across online and physical stores fell 2.4%, and the average ticket dropped 1.4%. Target said Tuesday that it couldn\u2019t reliably estimate the individual impact of each of the factors that were hurting its business.",
      "Target is setting up a new office to be led by Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke would focus on making faster decisions to help accelerate sales growth. Current Chief Strategy and Growth Officer Christina Hennington will move into a strategic adviser role.",
      "Target is also intensifying efforts to entice customers who are nervous about the economy and inflation. The retailer says it is offering 10,000 new items starting at $1 \u2014 with the majority under $20.",
      "\u201cI want to be clear,\u201d Target CEO Brian Cornell told reporters on a call Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied with these results, so we\u2019re moving with urgency to navigate through this period of volatility ... We\u2019ve got to drive traffic back into our stores or visits to our site.\u201d",
      "Out of 35 merchandise categories including discretionary and essentials that the company tracks, it\u2019s gaining or maintaining market share in only 15, the company said. The company cited that there were some market share gains in women\u2019s swimwear, infant and toddler clothing, and active wear.",
      "The latest results underscore Target's ongoing struggle in recent years to revive sales particularly in nonessentials like fashion and home furnishings as competition grows more fierce with the likes of Walmart and Amazon. Target's shares have fallen more than 37% in the past 52 weeks.",
      "Target rival Walmart reported strong quarterly sales last week. The nation\u2019s largest retailer said it's already raised prices on some items due to tariffs and that more price hikes are on the way this summer when the back-to-school shopping season goes into high gear. For example, car seats made in China that currently sell for $350 at Walmart will likely cost customers another $100, executives said.",
      "Target didn\u2019t offer specifics on tariffs\u2019 impact on prices, but said that it was looking at different ways to offset those costs.",
      "\u201cWe look at competition,\u201d Cornell told reporters. \u201cWe make adjustments literally each and every week, so we\u2019re constantly adjusting pricing. Some are going up. Some will be reduced.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s threatened 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced May 12, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days.",
      "Yet Americans were already pulling back on spending as they grow increasingly uneasy over the state of the U.S. economy. Companies including toy manufacturer Mattel, toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble have announced higher prices or plans to raise prices because of the trade war kicked of by the U.S.",
      "Walmart was able to dodge some of the tariff damage other retailers are suffering because groceries account for about 60% of its U.S. business. Target is more reliant on discretionary items like clothing and accessories, with less than a quarter of its sales coming from groceries.",
      "Target has reduced the number of its store-label products sourced from China to 30% now from 60% in 2017. The company is on its way to reducing that number to 25% by the end of next year, the company said. Target is shifting sourcing to Guatemala and Honduras and is looking to sourcing in the U.S.",
      "Target is being pressured on other fronts as well.",
      "The company in January said it would phase out a handful of DEI initiatives, including a program designed to help Black employees advance their careers and promote Black-owned businesses. Conservative activists and President Donald Trump have sought to dismantle DEI policies in the federal government, schools, and at private businesses.",
      "The pastor of a Georgia megachurch who led a nationwide 40-day boycott of Target stores in response called last month for a continuation of that effort.",
      "The Rev. Jamal Bryant is seeking a reinvigorated commitment from Target on diversity, and he wants more support from Target for Black-owned banks and businesses.",
      "Target earned $1.04 billion, or $2.27 per share, for the period ended May 3. That compares with $942 million, or $2.03 per share, in the year-ago period.",

      "U.S. funding cuts have hit a local language learning program in Mali that empowered thousands",
      "MOUNTOUGOULA, Mali -- For Aminata Doumbia, an 18-year-old Malian, the \u201cShifin ni Tagne\u201d project was a path for her life dreams. A phrase meaning \u201cour future\u201d in the country\u2019s main local language, it refers to a yearslong program aimed at teaching around 20,000 young Malians to read and write in their local languages.",
      "Backed by $25 million in funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, over five years, the project has now shut down following the Trump administration's decision to cut 90% of the agency\u2019s foreign aid.",
      "\u201cThe joy I felt when I was selected for this project has been replaced by sadness,\u201d said Doumbia in Mali's capital, Bamako.",
      "She had hoped to take advantage of the empowerment program to train as a pastry chef.",
      "\u201dI don\u2019t have any hope of realizing my dream (again),\" Doumbia said.",
      "Doumbia is among thousands of people who now find themselves stranded in Mali, a country ravaged by high poverty and insecurity levels and where 70% of the population of at least 22 million people haven\u2019t had the opportunity to learn to read and write, according to Sylla Fatoumata Ciss\u00e9, director of a government agency focusing on nonformal education and national languages in Mali.",
      "The USAID funding cut also came at a time when Mali\u2019s other development partners in Europe have withdrawn their support in the aftermath of the 2021 coup, which brought the current junta leader, Assimi Goita, to power.",
      "For many, the literacy project was the only path to literacy and empowerment.",
      "Once literate, program beneficiaries move on to the next stage, which involves the acquisition of vocational skills like hairdressing, carpentry, sewing, welding, and pastry-making, according to Modibo Sissoko, literacy supervisor at the Malian Association for Survival in the Sahel nonprofit involved in the \u201cShifin ni Tagne\u201d project.",
      "These skills enable the economically disadvantaged to create jobs for themselves, earn a living or support their families, Sissoko said.",
      "\u201cWith the teaching of mother tongues, it\u2019s possible to move quickly towards mass literacy among the population,\u201d said Issiaka Ballo, a professor and researcher in native languages at Mali's University of Bamako.",
      "On the other hand, \"only 30% of the population has been educated in French,\u201d the common language in the country, he added.",
      "USAID\u2019s involvement in Mali had made it the primary development partner of the government. The abrupt end of its assistance hit not only the literacy programs, but also others designed to increase adult education and expand the literacy project to public schools.",
      "The Gaoussou Dabo School in the Malian capital, Bamako, is among 1,000 schools that benefited from mother-tongue education thanks to funding from USAID.",
      "Teachers trained for the program last year continue to teach, but the monitoring and evaluation aspect of the program has been withdrawn.",
      "The funding cut was \"a big shock for us,\u201d said Amadi Ba, a counsellor at the Pedagogical Animation Center, which is in charge of the school in Bamako.",
      "In a country where local language-education relies solely on funding from Mali\u2019s development partners with little to no help from the government, concerns exceed its immediate impact on the education of children.",
      "In 2023, Mali's military government decided to make the country\u2019s native tongues the official languages in place of French, which then became the \u201cworking language.\u201d Official documents, including the constitution, the mining code and other texts, were then translated into the national languages.",
      "The USAID cut will \"certainly have a negative impact on the development of mother-tongue education, especially since it came in the middle of the school year,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 said.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t even had time to think about a mechanism to cushion the blow,\u201d she added.",
      "While it lasted, the program was beneficial to many in various ways.",
      "Oumou Traor\u00e9, a mother of two who grows onions and eggplants for a living, recalled how the training improved her farming business, particularly in pricing her goods in Bamako's Mountougoula district.",
      "\u201cSince I learned to calculate the weight of my onions and keep my accounts in my mother tongue, I\u2019ve started selling my onions myself,\u201d said Traore, 29. \u201cI now earn $95 instead of the $60 I used to get. This has encouraged me to grow other vegetables.\u201d",
      "The 2021 coup resulted in the country turning to Russia as a key ally after severing ties with the West, including the U.S., which at some point was Mali's leading foreign aid donor.",
      "While some experts have said the withdrawal of U.S. aid may open the door for rivals such as Russia, whose mercenaries have been accused of human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings in the country, some say USAID has left a hole too large to be filled by others.",
      "\u201cIt will be difficult to find takers for the projects left behind by USAID,\u201d said Fatimata Tour\u00e9, a development specialist and director of the Research, Study and Training Group civic group in Mali.",

Oil executives and bankers followed, too, as American executives dropped everything \u2014 canceling longstanding obligations and zooming into board meetings back home \u2014 to cozy up to Trump and bolster the image he tried to sell on his first major foreign trip.",

      "Corporate titans are spending more time than ever working to curry favor with the administration as part of their effort to score relief from regulations \u2014 and tariffs \u2014 from the transactional president. He, in turn, is happy to use them as supporting cast members as he tries to project the economy as booming at a time when growth is slowing.",
      "But putting in time with the U.S. president has not fully insulated companies such as Apple, Amazon, Walmart and others from Trump's anger. It's a sign that the public commitments they make to create U.S. jobs may be doing more to burnish the president's image than to protect their own profitability.",
      "In private, CEOs and executives on Trump\u2019s trip marveled at how they came to be unofficial members of the president's traveling party, their private jets hopscotching across the Gulf as Trump visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. They said they had little choice but to get close to Trump, especially as he wields his tariff powers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thinking we have a president of the United States doing the selling,\u201d Trump said in Abu Dhabi, standing alongside the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Tomislav Mihaljevic, and working in a dig at his presidential predecessor, Joe Biden. \u201cYou think Biden would be doing it? I don\u2019t think so. But I think it's so important. I have to be a cheerleader for our country.\u201d",
      "The host countries and the White House pulled together business conferences in a matter of weeks to give Trump a stage to show off his dealmaking on the trip.

      "\u201cHe wants the vanity of people coming in to kiss his ring,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, CEO of Yale University\u2019s Chief Executive Leadership Institute. He said the behavior by CEOs, while obsequious, often resulted in better treatment and free publicity from the government.",

He came all the way from France.\"",

      "Executives at multiple companies, insisting on anonymity to describe private interactions, said it wasn't always clear who in Trump's orbit could best relay their views on tariffs, regulations and taxes to the president. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emerged as their preferred go-between, but that hasn't completely immunized the companies from attacks by Trump.",
      "Walmart CEO Doug McMillon had a previously scheduled call on Saturday with Bessent, only to separately become the target of Trump's ire in a social media post in which the president said America's largest retailer should \u201ceat\u201d the cost of his tariffs.",
      "Trump in April called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who had attended his inaugural, after a report that the online outlet was considering displaying on product listings the impact of Trump's tariffs on prices. Amazon had explored the possibility for its Amazon Haul service, which competes against China-founded discounters Temu and Shein, but had chosen not to do so.",
      "The heads of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis met with Trump to outline how his tariffs would disrupt automaking.

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Congress may stop California from implementing its first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation's most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump's administration doubles down on fossil fuels.",
      "California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.",
      "The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California\u2019s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "Trump rescinded California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden\u2019s administration restored it in 2022.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.",
      "The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.",
      "California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.",
      "The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.",
      "New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.",
      "Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state's tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars if it gets blocked and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate's upcoming vote.",
      "The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.",
      "\u201cBanning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,\" Mike Stanton, the group's president and CEO, wrote in a letter.",
      "The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.",
      "\u201cWhile transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,\u201d said Josh Lovelace, the group's national director.",
      "Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation's grid can't handle California's plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California's struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.",
      "\u201cOur already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,\u201d he said in a statement announcing the vote.",
      "Newsom's administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.",
      "But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.",
      "Newsom has also recently touted the state's growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state's electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state's transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an \u201cunprecedented rate.\u201d",
      "Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.",
      "Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California's plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state's previous zero-emission vehicle standards.",
      "But some of those states are already backing away.",
      "Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California's, saying the pace wasn't realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state's EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.",

      "Around 280 Bangladeshi migrant workers are demanding unpaid wages from a Malaysian firm which was a supplier to big Japanese companies",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Around 280 Bangladeshi migrant workers in Malaysia are demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars in back wages and other money owed to them after their former employer, a plastic parts supplier to big Japanese companies, closed down.",
      "The workers at Kawaguchi Manufacturing's factory in Port Klang, Malaysia's largest port city, were left stranded when the company withheld their wages for up to eight months before shutting down late last year. The workers have filed complaints in Malaysia and back home in Bangladesh.",
      "Such disputes have become a diplomatic sore point between Bangladesh and Malaysia, drawing scrutiny on a small but powerful group of recruitment agencies and middlemen who monopolize such jobs.",
      "Asif Nazrul, an adviser to Bangladesh\u2019s expatriate welfare ministry, met with Malaysia\u2019s Home Minister Steven Sim Chee Keong in Kuala Lumpur last week. Officials were due to meet again Wednesday in Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital.",
      "The interim government that took over in Bangladesh after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has placed a higher priority on the plight of migrant workers who often get trapped in debt after paying exorbitant recruitment fees to work in dismal conditions for little pay.",
      "Labor advocates say the situation is worsening as more people from across South Asia, sometimes losing their livelihoods due to climate change, seek work in Southeast Asia.",
      "Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have accelerated that trend as factories move from China to places in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and elsewhere.",
      "The workers have received just 251,000 ringgit ($58,101) of the more than 3 million ringgit ($694,444) in back wages that a Malaysian labor tribunal ordered Kawaguchi to pay. Many have found new jobs but still have heavy debts after borrowing money to pay hefty recruitment fees.",
      "The workers allege they were sometimes required to work without breaks for 24-hour shifts and on holidays with no paid overtime, making plastic casings for televisions and air conditioners. They say Kawaguchi confiscated their passports, provided inadequate housing and delayed their visa renewals.",
      "The factory shut down in December, soon after Sony Group and Panasonic Holdings Corp., two of Kawaguchi's main customers, halted their orders in response to the allegations against their supplier.",
      "After the factory closed, the workers say Malaysian officials forcibly sent many of them to another city some 360 kilometers (220 miles) away to toil in new factory jobs without giving them any information. They were kept in filthy shipping containers converted into dormitories. Another 80 workers were told to work in palm oil plantations \u2014 but refused.",
      "Most made their way back to Port Klang to seek work and chip away at the debts that have been accumulating. It took nearly three months for them to get permission from the Malaysian government to switch jobs.",
      "The Associated Press got no response to multiple requests to Kawaguchi for comment. Malaysia's labor department also didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Md Kabir Hossain\u2019s case is typical. The 19-year-old said he borrowed more than $4,000 to get to Malaysia from his hometown Rangpur in Bangladesh in November 2023, after his family\u2019s textile shop began to fail. The family\u2019s sole wage earner, he defaulted on one of his loans and wasn\u2019t able to send money back home, as his family struggled to keep their shop going.",
      "\u201cI am constantly worried about what will happen to my family,\u201d he said.",
      "Another worker, Parvez Azam said he didn't know how much longer he could keep going. \u201cIf this goes on, we'll die here,\u201d he said.",
      "Factories in Malaysia and other countries in Southeast Asia rely on migrant workers, often from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal, to fill labor-intensive jobs in manufacturing, plantations, or construction that local workers won't perform for the wages offered.",
      "The cost of recruitment and migration from Bangladesh to Malaysia is among the most expensive in the world, according to the International Labor Organization\u2019s office in Bangladesh.",
      "The official recruitment fee is about $650 per worker. But all the workers at Kawaguchi said they paid nearly $5,000. The loans they took to pay such sums has pushed them into debt bondage as they labor to pay off ever mounting debts.",
      "In 2023, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Malaysia should end use of recruitment agents, describing the system as \u201cmodern slavery.\u201d But a 2024 study of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia found that more than 70% had spent at least half of their wages to pay off recruitment debts. Most have at least two loans and many said they were misled about their wages.",
      "Nearly everyone who migrates overseas from Bangladesh, one of the countries most affected by climate change, has suffered at least one form of modern slavery, like withholding of wages or physical violence, according to a study by the London-based think tank International Institute for Environment and Development.",
      "Mohamad Mohosin, 38, said he moved to Malaysia when his crops failed because of extreme weather. After going months without being paid his debt has spiraled, forcing his large family in Bangladesh to borrow still more money. \u201cMy family is in trouble,\u201d he said.",
      "Among migrant workers, Bangladeshis often end up in the riskiest jobs, such as plantation work where they can catch mosquito-borne diseases, or physically demanding factory or construction roles, where the likelihood of accidents is higher, said Shariful Islam Hasan of BRAC.",
      "\u201cDespite the high risk and the high migration cost, salaries are too low,\u201d he said.",
      "Panasonic, Sony and Daikin, three of Kawaguchi's former main customers among about a dozen, agreed to cover an estimated $1.3 million of the recruitment costs paid by the workers. It\u2019s unclear how much each company is contributing.",
      "\"This doesn't cover all the workers' costs, including interest rates of up to 30% they must pay on their loans,\" said Andy Hall, a British labor activist who has been helping the workers. Many have also defaulted on their debts after going months without wages.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely desperate and they\u2019re at very high risk of falling into even worse situations,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Daikin settled with the workers, agreeing to pay them more, although it says it accounted for only 1% to 2% of Kawaguchi's orders. The air conditioner manufacturer told AP it was working with human rights groups to resolve any remaining issues.",
      "Panasonic said it was \u201cproportionally reimbursing the recruitment fees\u201d paid by workers and had asked Kawaguchi to correct labor violations. It said it tried to support Kawaguchi but had to disengage from the company due to its financial woes and anticipated production problems.",
      "Sony told AP its code of conduct prohibits abusive labor practices in its supply chain. After investigating, it demanded corrective measures. \u201cWhen our demands were not satisfied, we terminated our relationship with this supplier,\u201d it said.",
      "The workers are seeking more help and lawyer Terry Collingsworth of U.S.-based International Rights Advocates, who is representing them, said that they were in discussions with Sony and Panasonic.",
      "\"We are not asking you to admit liability. We are asking you to comply with your public commitment to remediate when one of your suppliers violates the human rights of its workers,\u201d said a Jan. 16 letter from Collingsworth to Sony and Panasonic.",

      "Alcaraz has been the dominant player in the weeks leading to Roland-Garros and is the clear-cut favorite after claiming trophies in Barcelona and Rome. Nishikori is a former top-five player who has been struggling on the dirt in recent years.",
      "Alcaraz holds a 15-1 record on clay this season. Having moved back to No. 2 in the rankings, he can't play top-ranked Jannik Sinner before the final in Paris because they are on opposite sides of the draw.",

      "Back from his three-month doping suspension, Sinner pushed Alcaraz when they met in the Rome final this month, yet lost in straight sets. Sinner opens against local hope Arthur Rinderknech.",
      "Alcaraz beat Sinner over five sets in the French Open semifinals last year. Alcaraz then successfully defended his Wimbledon title for his fourth Grand Slam trophy. Sinner has won only one of his 19 career titles on clay, in Umag, Croatia, in 2022 \u2014 when he beat Alcaraz in the final.",
      "Novak Djokovic, who finally won a match on clay this year at the Geneva Open on Wednesday, will face Mackenzie McDonald of the United States in the first round. The 24-time Grand Slam singles champion won the Paris Olympics gold medal last August at Roland-Garros but has struggled on clay since then.",
      "Sinner could run into No. 5 seed Jack Draper in the quarterfinals, with other possible matchups featuring Alexander Zverev (3) vs. Djokovic (6), Taylor Fritz (4) vs. Lorenzo Musetti (8), and Alcaraz vs. Casper Ruud (7).",

      "\u201cI'm proud of my achievements here,\u201d Swiatek said. \u201cI'm working hard to be ready. For sure this season had more ups and downs than the years before. But I know my game is here.\u201d",
      "No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka faces Kamilla Rakhimova while No. 2 Coco Gauff will take on Olivia Gadecki. An interesting matchup will pit No. 10 Paula Badosa against four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka.",
      "The possible women's quarterfinals are Sabalenka against No. 8 Qinwen Zheng, last-year's runner-up Jasmine Paolini against Swiatek, Jessica Pegula (3) vs. Mirra Andreeva (6), and Gauff against Madison Keys (7)",

      "DALLAS -- The Dallas Stars aren't getting shut out on the power play in the Western Conference final against Edmonton this time.",
      "They took full advantage of their opportunities in the third period of Game 1 in this series, with three power-play goals in a game-turning 5:26 span on way to a 6-3 victory Wednesday night, a year after going 0 for 14 in six playoff games against the Oilers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great that we got some goals there and hopefully we can keep doing that,\u201d said Miro Heiskanen, whose got the first of the trio only 32 seconds into the final period.",

      "Mikael Granlund tied it at 3 with his power-play goal and Matt Duchene then put the Stars ahead to stay.",

In Game 7 of the first round against Colorado, Dallas overcame a 2-0 deficit in the third period on way to a 4-2 series-clinching win.",

      "They entered this series ranked third among playoff teams both for converting power plays (30.8%) and killing penalties (86.1%). Their power play was the best among any teams that played more than one round, and the teams better on PKs were Eastern Conference finalists Carolina and Florida.",
      "\u201cThe first power play we had was a little bit like the rest of our game. our execution was a little off, we didn\u2019t make great plays with the puck, we didn\u2019t have great support,\u201d DeBoer said. \u201cI thought in the third, we came out and we executed. I think you never know when that switch is going to go.",
      "\"Obviously, being at home here for this game, we get that first goal, the crowd gets into it, momentum shifts really quickly. That\u2019s the benefit of being at home here for Game 1.\u201d",

      "Miller flashed the choke signal to Knicks superfan Spike Lee while leading a rally in Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals. The Hall of Fame guard scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to put the Pacers up 3-2 in the series, though New York rallied to win the next two games.",

      "\u201cListen, players can do what they want and it\u2019s an emotional thing. It\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. We got to go out there, the place is unlikely to be any louder than it was tonight.\u201d",

      "Thoroughbred horses on a sprawling Kentucky farm are helping men trying to carve out clean and sober lives",
      "NICHOLASVILLE, Ky. -- Jaron Kohari never thought his path to sobriety would involve horses.",
      "The 1,000-pound animals unnerved him upon his arrival at a farm outside Lexington that teaches horsemanship to addicts, with the prospects of a job and a future if they get clean. But in short order they were making him feel content, the same emotion he used to chase with alcohol and drugs.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not used to caring for anything,\u201d said Kohari, a 36-year-old former underground coal miner from eastern Kentucky. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of selfish and these horses require your attention 24/7, so it teaches you to love something and care for it again.\"",
      "Frank Taylor\u2019s idea for the Stable Recovery program was born six years ago out of a need for help on his family\u2019s 1,100-acre farm that has foaled and raised some of racing's biggest stars in the heart of Kentucky horse country.",
      "The area is also home to America\u2019s bourbon industry and racing has long been associated with alcohol.",
      "\u201cIf a horse won, I drank a lot,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf a horse lost, I drank a lot.\u201d",
      "He believes his own consumption had contributed to a close family member\u2019s alcoholism. He quit and said he\u2019s been sober for five years.",
      "The basic framework for the program at Taylor Made Farm came from a restaurant he frequents whose owner operates it as a second-chance employment opportunity for people in recovery. Taylor thought something similar would work on his farm, given the physical labor involved in caring for horses and the peaceful atmosphere.",
      "Taylor just had to convince his three brothers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty radical idea because we\u2019re dealing with million-dollar horses and a lot of million-dollar customers and to say, \u2018Hey, I want to bring in some alcoholics, some felons, some heroin addicts, some meth addicts, whatever.\u2019 There was a laundry list of things that could go wrong,\u201d he recalled.",
      "His brothers\u2019 response?",
      "\u201cFrank, we think you\u2019re nuts.\"",
      "He reminded them the farm\u2019s mission statement includes living Christian values while serving customers and making a profit. They agreed to let him try it for 90 days, with the promise he would shut it down if anything went wrong.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gone perfectly, but it\u2019s been so much more good than bad,\u201d Taylor said. \"The industry\u2019s really embraced it, the community around Lexington and all over the country have really embraced it, and we\u2019ve had fantastic results.\"",
      "Taylor said 110 men have successfully completed the program, which requires participants to be 30 days sober before they start.",
      "Funded by donations, Stable Recovery does no advertising. Colleagues in the racing industry contact Taylor about potential participants. Sobriety homes and judges in the area also refer men, with the program offered as an alternative to jail.",
      "It doesn\u2019t charge its participants until they start earning money once they begin working on the farm.",
      "At that point, they pay $100 a week for food, housing, clothing and transportation. They earn $10 an hour the first 90 days, then get a raise to $15 to $17 an hour.",
      "The goal is to keep men in the program for a year as opposed to other recovery programs that run for 30, 60 or 90 days.",
      "That allows bonds to form among the group, instills confidence and gives the men time to rebuild their lives and relationships with their families.",
      "But for every success story, there are some who don\u2019t last.",
      "\"They come in here and they think that they\u2019re ready and they\u2019re really not ready,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a gift of desperation to where they\u2019ve got to change and they\u2019ve hit the bottom and they have to be willing to do a lot of little stuff that\u2019s aggravating and challenging.\u201d",
      "That includes rising at 4:30 a.m., cleaning their room, keeping the public areas spotless. There are Alcoholic Anonymous meetings at 6 a.m. and work hours run from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. four days a week. Life on the farm involves grooming the horses, getting them out of their stalls and into the pastures daily, visits from veterinarians and farriers, and farm maintenance.",
      "The other days the men attend therapy offsite or visit doctors in an effort to build their sobriety. Stable Recovery partners with an outpatient treatment program that provides classes and therapists and both sides keep in constant communication.",
      "At night, the men take turns making dinner for the group and then it\u2019s lights out at 9 p.m.",
      "Always waiting for them are the horses, their big dark eyes staring from their stalls. The animals are barometers for how their human handlers are feeling each day.",
      "\u201cI think the horse is the most therapeutic animal in the world,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThere\u2019s other animals like dogs that are very good, but there\u2019s something about a horse, like Winston Churchill said, \u2018The outside of a horse is good for the inside of a man.'\"",
      "New arrivals often have nothing to be proud of and are weary of being judged by their families, their communities and the legal system. They\u2019re depressed, anxious, sometimes suicidal.",
      "\u201cBeing around a horse early in recovery, it\u2019s a difference-maker,\u201d said Christian Countzler, CEO and co-founder of Stable Recovery who said he overcame his own addictions to alcohol and drugs.",
      "\u201cWithin days of being in a barn around a horse, he\u2019s smiling, he\u2019s laughing, he\u2019s interacting with his peers. A guy that literally couldn\u2019t pick his head up and look you in the eye is already doing better,\u201d he said.",
      "Kohari said he had been in and out of treatment since he was 18, failing numerous times to kick the lure of alcohol and then heroin, fentanyl and meth, before coming to Taylor Made Farm.",
      "\u201cI was just broken,\u201d Kohari said. \u201cI just wanted something different and the day I got in this barn and started working with the horses, I felt like they were healing my soul.\u201d",
      "After completing the program, he worked at WinStar Farm before returning to Taylor Made Farm as a coordinator for a barn full of pregnant mares.",
      "Stable Recovery helps the men get a job in the industry after 90 days when they graduate from its School of Horsemanship. Participants don't have to work in the industry but the majority want to.",
      "Among other successful graduates are the sons of two racing industry veterans.",
      "Blane Servis, a recovering alcoholic, is an assistant trainer to Brad Cox in Kentucky. Servis\u2019 father, John, trained 2004 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Smarty Jones.",
      "Will Walden beat a 12-year heroin addiction to become a trainer. His father, Elliott Walden, is president and CEO of racing operations for WinStar Farm. He previously trained Victory Gallop to a win in the 1998 Belmont Stakes.",
      "Once the younger Walden, Tyler Maxwell and Mike Lowery had gotten clean, they asked Taylor to find someone to buy 10 horses so they could train them.",
      "Unable to convince anyone, Taylor talked himself into it. He purchased 10 horses at $40,000 each.",
      "\u201cI tell my wife and she\u2019s ready to kill me,\u201d he said.",
      "He upped the ante by putting in another $400,000 to care for the horses and hire Walden and the other men to train, leaving Taylor on the hook for $800,000.",
      "His wife was still upset, so he found others to buy in for $200,000.",
      "\u201cWe lost about half our money,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cbut from that all those guys stayed sober and today Will Walden has 50 horses in training.\u201d",
      "Walden\u2019s stable earned $4.2 million last year.",
      "His filly, the aptly named Bless the Broken, recently finished third in the $1 million Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs.",
      "Maxwell is an exercise rider at WinStar Farm\u2019s training center. Lowery is the divisional broodmare manager at Taylor Made.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking to get these guys sober,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cand then you can get them in spots to work where they can advance in the industry and we\u2019re seeing that happen on a daily basis.\"",

With the Pacers down two and time running down, he started to lose control of his dribble, regained it and dribbled back out toward the 3-point line.

      "Jalen Brunson scored 43 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 35 points and 12 rebounds. But the Knicks couldn\u2019t protect the big lead they built while Brunson was on the bench in foul trouble in the fourth quarter and had a collapse unlike any other in the postseason.",
      "Teams leading by at least 14 points in the final 2:45 of the fourth quarter had been 994-0 since detailed play-by-play began being kept in 1997-98.",
      "\u201cGive them a lot of credit. They closed the game out like they\u2019ve been doing all playoffs,\u201d Brunson said. \u201cJust not really good on our part.\u201d",
      "The Pacers beat the Knicks in Game 7 of the East semifinals at Madison Square Garden last year, routing a team that had been decimated by injuries.",
      "This was an entirely different way to win, with the Pacers looking all but out of the game after the Knicks' 14-0 run with Brunson on the bench pushed New York's two-point lead to 108-92.",
      "Even after Nesmith started to get hot, the Knicks seemed safe when Brunson's 3-pointer made it 119-105 with 2:51 to go. But Nesmith would later hit consecutive 3s and both free throws when the Knicks fouled him intentionally so he couldn't try to tie it with another, giving Indiana the chance to tie on Haliburton's shot.",

      "Northwestern has its first NCAA title in women's golf after a thriller over Stanford at La Costa",
      "CARLSBAD, Calif. -- Northwestern captured its first NCAA Women's golf title Wednesday when Dianna Lee holed a 5-foot par putt on the 18th hole to beat Andrea Revuelta for a 3-2 victory over top-seeded Stanford to end a final hour of high tension.",
      "Stanford advanced through stroke play with a record score to win by 27 shots and was poised to win its third NCAA title in four years and become the first team to win back-to-back since the move to match play in 2017.",
      "Instead, the Wildcats were screaming with delight at at La Costa when Lee \u2014 who had twice before missed putts that would have won it \u2014 delivered the biggest putt of her life.",
      "\u201cMore than doing what people didn't think you could is this group believing what it thought it could do,\u201d Northwestern coach Emily Fletcher said.",
      "Stanford junior Megha Ganne had a 5-and-4 win in the lead match, while Hsin Tai Lin of Northwestern scored a 3-and-2 victory.",
      "Laura Nguyen put the Wildcats on the verge of the title with a 7-foot birdie putt for a 1-up victory over Paula Martin Sampedro.",
      "That left Northwestern needing only one more point from either Dianne Lee, who was 3-up with five holes to play, or Elise Lee, who had taken her first lead over Stanford's Kelly Xu on the 15th hole.",
      "Stanford didn't go down without a might fight.",
      "Xu, who missed a 4-foot putt to fall behind for the first time all match, answered with a 15-foot birdie on the par-3 16th and a wedge to 10 feet for birdie on the 17th to regain control. They halved the 18th hole, giving Xu a 1-up victory and team score at 2-all.",
      "It came down to the final match that Dianna Lee once had firmly in her grasp. Revuelta bogeyed the 11th and 12th holes to fall 3 down with five holes to play, But she won the 14th with a par and holed a 15-foot birdie putt on the 15th to get within one.",
      "Lee was in a back bunker, blasted out to 7 feet and missed her par putt on the 16th. Revuelta, however, pulled her 4-foot par putt to stay 1 down. On the next hole, Lee had a 12-foot birdie putt to win the match and pulled it, running it nearly 5 feet by. Miss that and the match was all square. She holed it to stay 1 up going to the 18th.",
      "The par-5 closing hole amounts to a wedge contest with a stream guarding the green. Both players had about 18 feet. Lee's uphill putt spun hard off the left lip and rolled 5 feet by. Revuelta left her downhill putt short, setting up Lee with 5 feet for the win.",
      "This time, she made it and the celebration was on for Northwestern, which had reached the final once before in 2017 before losing to Arizona State.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The organizers of the Los Angeles Olympics remain optimistic that Major League Baseball will find a way to join the NFL in sending the world's best athletes in their respective sports to the 2028 Games.",
      "LA28 president and chairman Casey Wasserman said he has been in close contact with MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred about the decision that must be made by both the league and the players' union on whether to send players to the Olympics in the middle of the 2028 baseball season. There's no current timetable for the decision.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m optimistic because it\u2019s the right thing for the sport of baseball, it\u2019s the right thing for the players and it\u2019s certainly the right thing for the Olympics,\u201d Wasserman told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \u201cI think when things make sense for everybody, you can usually find a way to get things done.\u201d",
      "LA28 was buoyed last week by the NFL owners' unanimous decision to approve the players' participation in the inaugural Olympic flag football event, with Wasserman calling it \u201can awesome day.\" The Los Angeles organizing committee is hoping for similar news on baseball, whenever the decision is made.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very engaged with the commissioner,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cI talked to him in anticipation of the NFL announcement so they knew what was coming. They have a different challenge because it\u2019s in the middle of their season, but we are very engaged in ongoing discussions with the hope to get to a good result.\u201d",
      "Players' union head Tony Clark has said his players want to vie for Olympic gold \u2014 particularly those who got a taste of international competition in previous World Baseball Classics. Several superstars have expressed public interest in playing in the Los Angeles Olympic tournament, including reigning league MVPs Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani.",
      "But the decision is much tougher for baseball because the Olympics fall in the heart of the regular season, necessitating major scheduling changes similar to the quadrennial disruption of the NHL season when the league participates in the Winter Olympics. Baseball also isn\u2019t a pillar of the Olympic program like ice hockey, being only intermittently included in the Summer Games for decades.",
      "The NFL players who make their nations' 10-man flag football teams are unlikely to miss more than a few days of training camp in July 2028, but MLB would have to make a dramatic adjustment to its normal competition schedule.",
      "Manfred spoke about the decision last month in New York at a meeting of the Associated Press Sports Editors. Wasserman has been pitching Manfred for over a year on the benefits of putting his sport under the Olympic spotlight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated issue for us,\u201d Manfred said at the APSE event. \"Lots of major league players would be involved because of the different countries that would likely be involved, massively disruptive to our season given the timing, and we\u2019re trying to sort through all that. ... We do see LA28 as a real opportunity from a marketing perspective.\u201d",
      "The sport long known as America's Pastime was played only as one-game Olympic exhibitions until 1984, when it joined the Los Angeles program as a demonstration sport.",
      "Baseball became an official Olympic sport in Barcelona in 1992, but U.S. professionals weren't allowed to compete until 2000, when minor leaguers were allowed to play. The absence of the world's players was one reason cited when baseball was subsequently dropped from the London and Rio de Janeiro Games.",
      "The sport returned in baseball-mad Tokyo in 2021 \u2014 but only for MLB players not on a 40-man roster. Japan's top league shut down its season, and Japan won gold.",
      "Baseball was dropped once again in Paris, but restored for LA28. The tournament will be played at historic Dodger Stadium, the same venue that hosted the 1984 Olympic tournament.",
      "Wasserman spoke about his baseball aspirations after an event that should remind MLB of the Olympics' unmatched marketing power. NBCUniversal has taken over a large soundstage complex in suburban Sun Valley to create extensive multimedia content to be used in the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics broadcasts in nine months, feeding the broadcast machine that boosts winter stars including Chloe Kim, Mikaela Shiffrin and Lindsey Vonn to international celebrity.",

      "After watching drama-filled offseasons when it came to contract negotiations the past two years with his San Francisco 49ers teammates, Brock Purdy was intent on doing his best to avoid a repeat in his situation",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- After watching drama-filled offseasons when it came to contract negotiations the past two years with his San Francisco 49ers teammates, Brock Purdy was intent on doing his best to avoid a repeat in his situation.",
      "Purdy and the 49ers managed to do just that when they agreed on a five-year extension worth $265 million following talks that had had no public acrimony.",
      "Purdy described said the initial offer from the 49ers as \u201crespectful\u201d and made a point of showing up to the start of the offseason program last month as a sign of good faith. That all led to the deal getting finalized before the 49ers begin on-field practices this spring with an extension that makes Purdy one of the top 10 paid quarterbacks in the NFL but doesn't handcuff the team from building a strong roster around him.",
      "\u201cI think where we ended up was exactly where we needed to be,\" Purdy said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy with where we ended and I know the Niners are too. With that being said, for me it\u2019s all about football now. However they use the cap space and all that kind of stuff, that\u2019s not my job. My job is to now go and win games and lead this team. But I\u2019m extremely happy and grateful for where we ended.\u201d",
      "It's been quite a journey for Purdy, who was lightly recruited out of high school and then picked last in 2022 after a strong college career at Iowa State.",
      "But the player once known as \u201cMr. Irrelevant\u201d because of his draft status has proved himself worthy of a contract on par with quarterbacks who entered the league with higher pedigree after helping the Niners reach the Super Bowl in his first full season as a starter in 2023.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s 32 starting quarterbacks and those guys, like it\u2019s not the easiest job in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, with what I\u2019ve done and everything, I could hang my hat on the fact that I\u2019ve had success in this league and I\u2019m capable of leading an organization all the way to the end, the Super Bowl. I proved that. I know who I am and I\u2019m going to obviously want to get what I deserve, but also surround myself, like I said, with guys around me and not just try to take every penny for myself. But that\u2019s the whole point of negotiating, you go throughout that you try to meet in the middle ground.\u201d",
      "Purdy has made less than $1 million a year for his first three seasons and was set to get a small raise in 2025 to about $5.2 million under the league\u2019s proven performance escalator for making the Pro Bowl last season.",
      "Purdy\u2019s success helped rescue the Niners from a potentially catastrophic mistake after they traded three first-round picks to draft Trey Lance third overall in 2021, only to watch him struggle before getting traded away in 2023.",
      "He took over as starter late in his rookie season. He won the final five starts of the regular season and the first two rounds of the playoffs before suffering a serious injury to his throwing elbow early in an NFC title game loss to Philadelphia that season.",
      "Purdy had one of the most prolific passing seasons in team history in 2023 when he finished fourth in the NFL in MVP voting and helped the team reach the Super Bowl before losing in overtime to Kansas City.",
      "He set a franchise record for yards passing (4,280) and became the first Niners QB in more than two decades to throw at least 30 TD passes (31). Purdy led the NFL with a 113 passer rating and his 9.6 yards per attempt were the most in the NFL for a qualifying QB since Kurt Warner had 9.9 in 2000.",
      "That success was harder to come by in 2024 as Purdy was hampered by injuries to key offensive players like Christian McCaffrey, Trent Williams and Brandon Aiyuk. His passer rating dropped nearly 17 points to 96.1, he had only 20 TD passes and 12 interceptions on the season, and also came up short in several late-game scenarios when the 49ers had a chance for a comeback win.",
      "Purdy\u2019s play was part of a team-wide downturn that led to a 6-11 record and the first missed playoff appearance for San Francisco since 2020. That was one reason why he wanted to make sure he was part of the entire offseason program to help engineer a rebound.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s bought in right now and we\u2019re excited, obviously, to do more team activities and stuff as we move along the offseason,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain, but the young guys, the older guys, everybody is bringing it right now and I think it\u2019s just so important that we\u2019re just around each other a lot doing little different activities and continuing to build chemistry.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Jim Irsay, the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 owner who leveraged the popularity of Peyton Manning into a new stadium and a Super Bowl title, died Wednesday at age 65",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Jim Irsay started his football career as a ball boy. He finished it as a team owner.",
      "Along the way, the NFL\u2019s music man created his own, unique brand.",
      "Irsay worked his way up through the organization, learning how to run a football team, restoring the Colts\u2019 once-proud tradition to glory and created what some have dubbed the greatest guitar collection on Earth \u2014 all while battling health issues and addictions to alcohol and painkillers.",
      "On Wednesday, Irsay\u2019s remarkable journey ended at age 65. Pete Ward, Irsay\u2019s longtime right-hand man, made the announcement in a statement, saying Irsay died peacefully in his sleep.",
      "\u201cJim\u2019s dedication and passion for the Indianapolis Colts in addition to his generosity, commitment to the community and, most importantly, his love for his family were unsurpassed,\u201d Ward said. \u201cOur deepest sympathies go to his daughters, Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, Kalen Jackson and his entire family as we grieve with them.\u201d",
      "Irsay had a profound impact on the franchise.",
      "With the help of Hall of Fame general manager Bill Polian, Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy and Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning, Irsay turned the Colts from a longtime laughingstock into a perennial title contender, even winning a Super Bowl title.",
      "He then used that success \u2014 and Manning's aura \u2014 to help convince city leaders to build a retractable roof dome stadium that opened in 2008 and eventually allowed Indy to host a Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cI am heartbroken to hear about Jim Irsay\u2019s passing,\u201d Manning said on social media. \u201cHe was an incredibly generous and passionate owner and I will always be indebted to him for giving me my start in the NFL. His love for the Colts and the city of Indy was unmatched. His impact on the players who played for him will not be forgotten.\u201d",
      "More recently, though, Irsay battled health issues and became far less visible following a fall at his home Dec. 8, 2023.",
      "Police officers from Carmel, Indiana, a northern suburb of Indy, responded to a 911 call from Irsay\u2019s home. According to the police report, the officers found Irsay breathing but unresponsive and with a bluish skin tone.",
      "A month later, Irsay was diagnosed with a respiratory illness.",
      "During his annual training camp news conference last summer, Irsay told reporters he was continuing to rehab from two subsequent surgeries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you guys, the fans and to be out here,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m feeling great, you know, just trying to get this left leg stronger, which it will be.\"",
      "Irsay also did not speak during the recent NFL draft as he usually did.",
      "But his story is one of a kind.",
      "As a teenager, he tossed footballs with MVP quarterbacks Johnny Unitas and Bert Jones. He relied frequently on the lessons he learned from rubbing elbows with some of the game\u2019s most important owners \u2014 Al Davis, Lamar Hunt, Wellington Mara and Art Rooney \u2014 as they worked through the 1982 players\u2019 strike and the implementation of a salary cap.",
      "And he presided over the greatest quarter-century of Colts football thanks to Manning and quarterback Andrew Luck.",
      "Irsay handled everything from ticket sales to public relations as he rose through the organization even watching No. 1 overall pick John Elway force a trade to Denver in 1983.",
      "When he took over as owner following his father's death in 1997, things were different. The arrival of Manning helped Irsay \u2014 and the Colts \u2014 create a passionate local following that hadn't previously existed but still remains strong today.",
      "It wasn't always easy, either.",
      "\u2014 When a 55% inheritance tax threatened his hold on the team, the younger Irsay found enough cash to keep the family business.",
      "\u2014 When his most prominent players were about to cash in during free agency, Irsay often ponied up top dollar to keep them.",
      "\u2014 And though some criticized him for focusing too much on offense and not enough on defense, the combination allowed the Colts to find their place in a small-market city that revered basketball.",
      "\u201cThe man hates to lose more than he likes to win,\u201d current general manager Chris Ballard often said.",
      "Things didn\u2019t always go smoothly, though.",
      "Robert Irsay was reviled in Baltimore following the move. Decades later, even after another Baltimore team won a Super Bowl, and after Jim Irsay repeatedly explained the move was precipitated by the city\u2019s attempt to take the franchise through eminent domain, Baltimore still referred to the team only as the Indianapolis football club.",
      "A quarter-century later, following a 2-14 record in 2011, Irsay tested the fans\u2019 loyalties by releasing a 34-year-old Manning, who missed the entire season with a neck injury. The rebuild began around rookie QB Andrew Luck \u2014 a move that drew comparisons to his father\u2019s trade of Unitas in 1973 and the subsequent selection of Jones in the draft.",
      "The impending decision about Manning also became a public spectacle throughout the 2011-12 offseason and again in 2013 when Manning returned to Indy for the first time with his new team, the Denver Broncos.",
      "\u201cIt was the right move to make. Peyton and I talked about it. He said it best in the press conference: I didn\u2019t decide, he didn\u2019t decide, the football gods had laid the cards out and we both knew it was best for him and us,\u201d Irsay said later. \u201cEmotionally, it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. In professional football, it\u2019s about winning and you have to be able to make the decisions that are best for the franchise.\u201d",
      "But football was only part of Irsay's story.",
      "He spent millions buying the original manuscripts to Jack Kerouac\u2019s generation-defining novel \u201cOn The Road\u201d and Alcoholics Anonymous\u2019 \u201cBig Book\u201d and routinely made them available to the public.",
      "His ever-expanding musical collection included instruments and items from The Beatles, James Brown, Prince, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Elton John, Johnny Cash and Jerry Garcia; signed Presidential documents; an original \u201cwanted\u201d poster for John Wilkes Booth; a 1953 Jackie Robinson bat; Muhammad Ali\u2019s title belt from the 1974 \u201cRumble in the Jungle;\u201d even the saddle from Secretariat\u2019s triple crown wins.",
      "Irsay also befriended singers such as Stephen Stills and John Mellencamp, took inspiration from the lyrics of Bob Dylan and revered the writings of Hunter S. Thompson, the self-described \u201cGonzo journalist.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun to have these pieces, and guitars are always kind of the most interesting, in some ways, because you can play them, unlike a book, a manuscript or a painting,\u201d Irsay said during the summer of 2016. \u201cYou can play them, and they can become four-dimensional.\u201d",
      "But Irsay also had his struggles.",
      "He was a recovering alcoholic and his professional successes couldn\u2019t insulate him from a constant battle with painkillers. In a November 2023 interview with HBO Sports, he acknowledged he had been to rehab at least 15 times and once accidentally overdosed.",
      "The low point may have come in March 2014 when he was arrested near his home in Carmel while driving erratically. When officers searched the car they found nearly $30,000 in cash and numerous bottles of prescription pills. Five and a half months later, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Irsay for six games and fined him $500,000.",
      "Irsay described the absence as heartbreaking.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t even imagine how hard that was,\u201d former Colts punter and now talk-show host Pat McAfee said after the suspension ended. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a guy who\u2019s been around the Colts his entire life, who personifies the Horseshoe.\u201d",
      "Still, he was wise enough to allow Polian almost free rein to construct a team that won a then-record number of regular-season games in a decade (115).",
      "And he leaves a legacy that won\u2019t be blowing in the wind.",
      "Aside from the images of Irsay wearing a tie wrapped around his forehead on a magazine cover, tossing footballs in a suit, or his utterances on Twitter, he was a shrewd businessman with a big heart.",
      "When the Colts won the Super Bowl, he even sent a ring to two-time rushing champ Edgerrin James, who had left in free agency before the championship season.",
      "\u201cThe guy grew up with this team,\u201d then-coach Chuck Pagano said in January 2015. \u201cHe\u2019s got so much insight and so much knowledge. He\u2019s a football man through and through. It runs through his veins and he\u2019s got so much wisdom to share with all of us. He makes a huge impact.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt was looking bad,\u201d Trump said, noting that Houston led by as many as 12 points in a game Florida rallied to win 65-63 in San Antonio in April. \u201dDid you think you were going to win?\"",
      "Florida (36-4) delivered four come-from-behind victories in six March Madness wins. The Gators led the finale for a total of 64 seconds, including the last 46 ticks of a contest that was in limbo until the final sequence.",
      "Trump recounted Alijah Martin making two free throws to put the Gators ahead to stay with 46.5 seconds left, and asked Martin if he was nervous.",
      "\u201cLesser teams would have crumbled,\u201d the president said.",
      "Florida secured the program\u2019s third title in basketball, and Trump noted that it is the only school to have a trio of NCAA titles in that sport and in football.

      "FORT WORTH, Texas -- Scottie Scheffler is skipping some of his usual prep work for the Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial after winning the PGA Championship last weekend.",
      "The world No. 1 doesn't want an emphasis on rest and recovery to be misunderstood.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t just show up here to Fort Worth to just walk around and celebrate last week,\u201d Scheffler said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m here for a reason, and that\u2019s not to just play a couple of ceremonious rounds and then ride off in the sunset. I\u2019m here for a reason. That\u2019s to compete.\u201d",
      "Scheffler's third major also set him up to be the first player since Dustin Johnson in 2017 to win three consecutive PGA Tour starts.",
      "He won his hometown CJ Cup Byron Nelson north of Dallas two weeks before the PGA, then skipped the $20 million signature event at the Truist Championship before winning at Quail Hollow.",
      "Colonial isn't quite on the level of the Nelson for Scheffler, who attended that event for years as a kid and made his pro debut there 11 years ago. Still, Colonial is in Texas, and not far from family and friends in Dallas.",
      "\u201cI think any time I can sleep in my own bed and play a golf tournament, it\u2019s a nice thing,\u201d said Scheffler, who has finished in the top three with a pair of runner-ups the past three years at Colonial. \u201cI love the golf course here. I think it\u2019s a great test. That\u2019s also one of the big reasons I try to come to this event each year is just for the golf course.\u201d",
      "Davis Riley is the defending Colonial champion and coming off his best finish at a major, tied for second behind Scheffler at the PGA.",
      "His first tour victory came in the debut of a renovation of the 7,289-yard, par-70 Colonial course made famous by Ben Hogan, the only back-to-back winner in Fort Worth (he did it in 1946-47 and 1952-53).",
      "\u201cIt was really firm because it was brand new,\u201d Riley, who is the same age as Scheffler at 28, said of last year's conditions. \u201cIt softened up. I think the fairways are ... maybe a little bit softer, more grown in. I would say the rough is a little bit up, but I think the greens, the quickness and the firmness will be very similar as to what we saw last year.\u201d",
      "Jordan Spieth is the other hometown favorite alongside Scheffler. And while his fellow Texas alum beat him to the first victory at the Nelson, Spieth is the one with his name on the wall of champions along the No. 1 tee box at Colonial. He won in 2016.",
      "Spieth missed the cut at the PGA in pursuit of the career grand slam. He finished 19 under at the Nelson, 12 shots behind Scheffler, who won by eight while tying the PGA Tour scoring record of 253.",
      "This is the fourth time Scheffler has had a chance to win three consecutive starts, all since 2022. Another significant feat in that span is joining Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only players with 15 victories before turning 29.",
      "Johnson's three-peat in 2017 included the Genesis Invitational, WGC-Mexico Championship and WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play.",
      "Now that he's back in his football-mad home state, Scheffler was asked if his rare show of raw emotion in slamming his cap on the green after winning the PGA was his version of a football spike.",
      "\u201cWhen I played football, I didn\u2019t score very many touchdowns, so I wasn\u2019t too experienced in that,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI don\u2019t really have much to say on that. I think I just kind of let my emotions out a little bit, and I guess that\u2019s where my brain decided it wanted to go at the time. I really have absolutely no explanation for it at all.\u201d",
      "Only one player has celebrated on the 18th green of the Byron Nelson and Colonial in the same year: Hogan in 1946.",

      "\u201cI knew it going into it,\" Postecoglou told CBS Sports. \u201cThis football club has had world-class managers, a lot better-credentialed than I am, and haven't been able to get there, so I knew I had a massive challenge in front of me.\u201d",
      "Here's a run-down of those second-season trophies won by Postecoglou across his career:",
      "___",
      "In his first job as a head coach, Postecoglou won Australia's top-flight title \u2014 the National Soccer League \u2014 in his second season with South Melbourne and again the following year.",
      "Postecoglou achieved the same feat at Brisbane Roar, winning the league title \u2014 by now it was called the A-League \u2014 in his second season and retaining it the following year.",
      "During the second year of Postecoglou's four-year stint with the Socceroos, Australia hosted the Asian Cup in early 2015 and reached the final against South Korea. The Australians conceded an equalizer in stoppage time \u2014 coincidentally scored by current Tottenham captain Son Heung-min \u2014 but clinched a 2-1 win after extra time. It was Australia's first Asian Cup title.",
      "In his first big job outside Australia, Postecoglou lost the Japanese Cup final in his first season with Yokohama F. Marinos but made up for it by winning the top-flight league title by six points the following year. It was the club's fourth Japanese league championship.",
      "At Celtic, Postecoglou was in charge of the biggest team in Scotland \u2014 albeit one which had relinquished its league title the previous year. Under the Australian, Celtic regained the Scottish Premiership title by four points in his first season and retained it \u2014 by seven points \u2014 in his second season. Postecoglou then left for Tottenham.",
      "Postecoglou has been coach at three other clubs in his managerial career, but never got to the end of a second full season with any of them. He was at Greek lower-league team Panachaiki (2008) for less than a year, with Australian team Whittlesea Zebras for just three months in 2009 and at Melbourne Victory for 18 months \u2014 but left at the start of his second full season to take over the Socceroos.",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",

    "story": [
      "Half of U.S. states now have laws banning or regulating cellphones in schools, with more likely to follow",
      "ATLANTA -- Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023.",
      "Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place, with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly\u2019s Education Committee, on May 13 called phones \u201ca cancer on our kids\u201d that are \u201cdriving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\u201d",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\u201cThis is a not just an academic bill,\u201d Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \u201cThis is a mental health bill. It\u2019s a public safety bill.\u201d",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \u201ca huge win.\"",
      "\u201cTeachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group\u2019s political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\u201cIt was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\u201cIt is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\u201d Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\u201cProviding some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201dThat said, most states have not.\"",

      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-long makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites.",
      "The next phase outlined at Google's annual developers conference includes releasing a new \u201cAI mode\u201d option in the United States. The feature makes interacting with Google's search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering questions on just about any topic imaginable.",
      "AI mode is being offered to all comers in the U.S. just two-and-half-months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.",
      "Google is also feeding its latest AI model Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy tickets to concerts and conduct searches through live video feeds.",
      "The expansion builds upon a transformation that began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called \u201cAI overviews\u201d that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.",
      "About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with \u201cAI overviews,\u201d according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.",
      "\u201cWhat all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said before a packed crowd in an amphitheater near the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters.",
      "Although Pichai and other Google executives predicted AI overviews would trigger more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites, it hasn't worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.",
      "Clickthrough rates from Google's search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge's recently released study, which attributed the decrease to people becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.",
      "The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google's confidence that the technology won't habitually spew misinformation that tarnishes its brand's reputation, and acknowledges the growing competition from other AI-powered search options from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
      "The rapid rise of AI alternatives emerged as a recurring theme in legal proceedings that could force Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire after a federal judge last year declared its search engine to be an illegal monopoly.",
      "In testimony during a trial earlier this month, longtime Apple executive Eddy Cue said Google searches done through the iPhone maker's Safari browser have been declining because more people are leaning on AI-powered alternatives.",
      "And Google has cited the upheaval being caused by AI's rise as one of the main reasons that it should only be required to make relatively minor changes to the way it operates its search engine because technology already is changing the competitive landscape.",
      "But Google's reliance on more AI so far appears to be enabling its search engine to maintain its mantle as the internet's main gateway \u2014 a position that's main reason its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., boasts a market value of $2 trillion.",
      "During the year ending in March, Google received 136 billion monthly visits, nearly 29 times more than ChatGPT, according to data compiled by onelittleweb.com.",
      "Even Google's own AI mode acknowledged that the company's search engine seems unlikely to be significantly hurt by the shift to AI technology when a reporter from The Associated Press asked whether its introduction would make the company even more powerful.",
      "\u201cYes, it is highly highly that Google's AI mode will make Google more powerful, particularly in the realm of information access and online influence,\u201d the AI mode responded. The feature also warns web publishers should be concerned about AI mode reducing the traffic that they get from search results.",
      "Google's upcoming tests in its Labs division foreshadow the next wave of AI technology likely to be made available to the masses.",
      "Besides using its Project Mariner technology to test the ability of an AI agent to buy tickets and book restaurant reservations, Google will also experiment with searches done through live video and an opt-in option to give its AI technology access to people's Gmail so it can learn more about a user's tastes and interests. Other features on this summer's test list include a \u201cDeep Search\u201d option that will use AI to dig even deeper into complex topics and another tool that will produce graphical presentations of sports and finance data.",
      "Google is also introducing its equivalent of VIP access to all its AI technology with an \u201cUltra\u201d subscription package that will cost $250 per month and include 30 terabytes of storage, too. That's a big step beyond Google's previous top-of-the-line AI \u201cpro\u201d package that cost $20 per month and included two terabytes of storage. \u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and Google have a licensing and technology agreement that gives Google\u2019s Gemini AI chatbot access to AP\u2019s news coverage.",

      "Hong Kong-traded shares in CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, have jumped after the company raised around $4.6 billion in the biggest initial public offering globally this year",
      "HONG KONG -- Shares in CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, jumped more than 16% Tuesday in its Hong Kong trading debut after it raised about $4.6 billion in the world\u2019s largest initial public offering this year.",
      "The solid reception for the Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., in Hong Kong suggests there is still an appetite among international investors for leading Chinese manufacturers despite trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.",
      "It sold more than 135 million shares at their maximum offer price, 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.6) each. Its shares rose after they started trading at 296 Hong Kong dollars ($37.80), 12.5% higher than their offer price. They closed 16.4% higher.",
      "CATL also has shares listed in Shenzhen, a business hub neighboring Hong Kong. They initially fell but then edged 1.2% higher.",
      "A supplier to automakers like Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Toyota and Honda, CATL held a nearly 38% global market share for EV batteries in 2024, its listing documents showed.",
      "The company has faced pressure from the U.S. In January, the U.S. Defense Department added it to a list of companies it says have ties to China\u2019s military, an accusation that CATL denied. It called the inclusion a \u201cmistake.\u201d",
      "In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.",
      "In the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is licensing technology from CATL to build batteries, but the plan faces resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who have expressed concern that the Chinese company could benefit from U.S. tax dollars.",
      "Because the U.S. has listed CATL as having ties to the U.S. military, the share offering excluded onshore U.S. investors. However, many large U.S. institutional investors have offshore accounts that allowed them to participate.",
      "The company said it plans to use most of the net proceeds from its IPO to build its factory in Hungary, meant to bring it closer to the manufacturing facilities of its main European customers.",
      "Government officials, including Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Secretary Paul Chan, attended its gong-striking ceremony in the city\u2019s vibrant business district, Central, on Tuesday. The company's chairman Robin Zeng said his business is committed to becoming a zero-carbon technology company.",
      "\u201cListing in Hong Kong means we are more broadly integrated into the global capital markets, and it\u2019s also a new starting point for us to promote the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d Zeng said.",
      "Zeng, who trained as a physicist, helped found Amperex Technology Ltd. in 1999. It mainly was engaged in research and development and manufacturing of consumer lithium batteries. The company was sold to Tokyo-listed TDK Corporation in 2005, but Zeng continued to oversee the firm's management until 2017, its listing documents say.",
      "In 2011, a team led by Zeng founded CATL, headquartered in the businessman's hometown of Ningde in Fujian province in southeast China. The literal meaning of the company's Chinese name is \u201cNingde Era.\"",
      "CATL says it has the broadest coverage of EV battery users globally, with its batteries installed in over 17 million EVs, or one in every three EVs worldwide, as of the end of 2024.",
      "Terence Chong, executive director of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong hasn\u2019t seen an IPO of this size in a while and the listing may boost such activity in the city.",
      "The exclusion of U.S. investors had little impact since there was sufficient demand for CATL's offering, he said.",
      "The amount of funds raised through IPOs in Hong Kong rose 89% year-on-year in 2024 following a double-digit decrease in 2023, according to Yujia Li, an analyst at the Hong Kong Financial Research Institute of the Bank of China.",
      "CATL recorded a profit of 55.3 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) in 2024, up 16.8% from 2023. Its listing surpassed JX Advanced Metals\u2019 $2.9 billion IPO in Japan in March, which was previously the largest this year, according to Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure.",
      "Monday\u2019s 66-32 procedural vote keeps one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities on track for passage and highlights the growing political strength of the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has amassed a large war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. Several Democrats reversed and voted to move forward with the legislation after negotiations with Republicans in recent days.",
      "The fate of the legislation, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had been uncertain in recent weeks despite early bipartisan support. Senate Democrats blocked it earlier this month in part over concerns about how Trump and his family were benefiting from private crypto endeavors, including a newly launched stablecoin.",
      "Republicans won support from Democrats after strengthening regulations on foreign issuers, beefing up enforcement and barring large tech companies like Meta and Google from issuing their own stablecoins. The Senate will now consider the bill and could vote on final passage as soon as this week, depending on the number of amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Still, Democrats were divided on the legislation. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have said the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the final bill does nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to rein in the President\u2019s crypto corruption,\u201d Warren said ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. She said the legislation would \u201caccelerate Trump\u2019s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market\u201d and make Trump \u201cthe regulator of his own financial product.\u201d",
      "Negotiators added tougher ethics rules for members of Congress and the executive branch, including preventing members of Congress from issuing stablecoins. But Warren and several other Democrats said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis Congress should be a check on the president,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The bill would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset for commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "The move to regulate the industry has been bipartisan, but Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And he is set to attend a dinner May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promoter, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previous enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "Democratic supporters of the legislation argued that Congress can\u2019t step aside just because of Trump\u2019s involvement in the market.",
      "\u201cThe stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the legislation. \u201cWe need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has signed the Take It Down Act into law",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation that first lady Melania Trump helped usher through Congress, and he had her sign it, too, despite what sounded like a mild objection on her part.",
      "\u201cC'mon, sign it anyway,\u201d the president told his wife. \u201cShe deserves to sign it,\u201d he said.",
      "After she added her signature, the president showed the document bearing both of their names to the audience at the signing ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Melania Trump's signature is merely symbolic because first ladies are not elected and have no formal role in the signing of legislation.",
      "In March, Melania Trump used her first public appearance since resuming the role of first lady to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby House members to pass the bill following its approval by the Senate.",
      "At a signing ceremony, she called the new law a \u201cnational victory\u201d that will help protect children from online exploitation, including through the use of artificial intelligence to make fake images.",
      "\u201cAI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\u201d",
      "The president said the proliferation of images made using AI means that \u201ccountless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other explicit images distributed against their will.\u201d He said what's happening is \u201cjust so horribly wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, we're making it totally illegal,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The bill makes it a federal crime to \u201cknowingly publish\u201d or threaten to publish intimate images without a person\u2019s consent, including AI-created \u201cdeepfakes.\u201d Websites and social media companies will be required to remove such material within 48 hours after a victim requests it. The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content.",
      "Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.",
      "The bill, sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent.",
      "But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.",
      "The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.",
      "After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a \u201cpowerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.\u201d",
      "Her advocacy for the bill is a continuation of the Be Best campaign she started in the president's first term, focusing on children's well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.",
      "In his speech to Congress in March, the president said he looked forward to signing the bill.",
      "\u201cAnd I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, adding, that there's nobody who \"gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\u201d",

      "Scientists have found evidence of monkey kidnappings in Panama",
      "WASHINGTON -- A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cThis was very much a shocking finding,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-size monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use, but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\u201cOur window into this story is constrained,\u201d said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.",
      "\u201cA hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don\u2019t know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals -- from gorillas to orcas -- have been observed carrying their own dead offspring, though scientists aren\u2019t sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren\u2019t eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all spent hours wracking our brains why they would do this,\u201d said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \u201ccaring motivation,\u201d or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \u201cremarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. clinched the political support needed to become the nation\u2019s top health official by pledging to work within the decades-old federal system for approval and use of vaccines. Yet his regulators are promising big changes that cloud the outlook for what shots might even be available.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration will soon \u201cunleash a massive framework\u201d for how vaccines are tested and approved, according to Commissioner Marty Makary. Details aren't yet public but the plan is being overseen by the agency's new vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the FDA's handling of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "Makary and other Trump administration officials already have taken unprecedented steps that raise uncertainty about next fall's COVID-19 vaccinations, including delaying FDA scientists' full approval of Novavax's shot \u2014 and then restricting its use to people at higher risk from the virus. They've also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products requiring extra testing.",
      "The changes cross multiple health agencies.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't yet acted on an influential advisory panel's recent recommendations on use of a new meningitis shot or broader RSV vaccination. A meeting of Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d allies was recently told to expect an end to COVID-19 booster recommendations for children \u2014 something that vaccine advisory panel was supposed to debate in June. And researchers around the country lost National Institutes of Health funding to study vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cI think you have to assume that RFK Jr.\u2019s intention is to make it harder for vaccines to come to market,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a vaccine expert at Johns Hopkins University. The changes are \u201clooked at suspiciously because this is someone with a proven track record of evading the value of vaccines.\u201d",
      "In a Senate health committee hearing last week, Kennedy wrongly claimed that the only vaccines tested against a placebo, or dummy shot, were for COVID-19.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the committee, briefly interrupted the hearing to say, \u201cFor the record, that\u2019s not true\" \u2014 pointing to placebo-controlled studies of the rotavirus, measles and HPV vaccines.",
      "Concerned by rhetoric about how vaccines are tested, a group of doctors recently compiled a list of more than 120 vaccine clinical trials spanning decades, most of them placebo-controlled, including for shots against polio, hepatitis B, mumps and tetanus.",
      "\u201cIt directly debunks the claim that vaccines were never tested against placebo,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, a Stanford University infectious disease physician who\u2019s helping lead the project.",
      "Antivaccine groups argue that some substances scientists call a placebo may not really qualify, although the list shows simple saline shots are common.",
      "Sometimes a vaccine causes enough shot-site pain or swelling that it\u2019s evident who\u2019s getting the vaccine and who\u2019s in the control group \u2014 and studies might use another option that slightly irritates the skin to keep the test \u201cblinded,\u201d Scott explained.",
      "And when there\u2019s already a proven vaccine for the same disease, it\u2019s unethical to test a new version against a placebo, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t always expect placebo-controlled trials,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that be communicated clearly to the public, but it\u2019s challenging especially when there\u2019s so much noise in social media and so much misinformation.\u201d",
      "The administration's promise of a new vaccine framework comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where FDA advisers will discuss updating COVID-19 shots for this fall and winter.",
      "The FDA\u2019s credibility has long rested on the independence of its scientific decisions. While the agency is led by a handful of political appointees, approval decisions are almost always handled by career scientists.",
      "But that standard appears to be shifting. FDA staffers were poised to approve Novavax\u2019s vaccine early last month but the decision was delayed by administration officials, including Makary, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss agency matters. The shot was approved late Friday with unusual restrictions.",
      "Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg \u2014 a political appointee serving as Makary's special assistant \u2014 was involved in the unprecedented demand that Novavax conduct a new clinical trial of its shot after approval, according to the people. The requirement came shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign.",
      "Hoeg \u2014 along with Makary and Prasad \u2014 spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic criticizing the FDA\u2019s handling of booster shots, particularly in children and young adults. All three were co-authors of a 2022 paper stating that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more harm than benefit.",
      "Novavax isn\u2019t the only vaccine manufacturer already affected by changing attitudes at FDA. Earlier this month, Moderna pushed back the target date for its new COVID-and-flu combination vaccine to next year after the FDA requested additional effectiveness data.",
      "As the FDA\u2019s top official overseeing vaccines, Prasad is now in position to reverse what he recently called \u201ca number of missteps\u201d in how the FDA assessed the benefits and risks of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "He questioned how much benefit yearly vaccinations continue to offer. In a podcast shortly before assuming his FDA job, Prasad suggested companies could study about 20,000 older adults in August or September to show if an updated vaccine prevented COVID-related hospitalizations.",
      "There is \u201clegitimate debate about who should be boosted, how frequently they should be boosted and the value of boosting low-risk individuals,\u201d said Hopkins' Adalja. But he stressed that CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has the proper expertise to be making those decisions.",
      "And other experts say simply updating the strain that a COVID-19 vaccine targets doesn't make it a new product \u2014 and real-world data shows each fall's update has offered benefit.",

      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted. Voting equipment, it says, should not use ballots that include \u201ca barcode or quick-response code.\u201d",
      "Those few technical words could have a big impact.",
      "Voting machines that give all voters a ballot with one of those codes are used in hundreds of counties across 19 states. Three of them -- Georgia, South Carolina and Delaware -- use the machines statewide.",
      "Some computer scientists, Democrats and left-leaning election activists have raised concerns about their use, but those pushing conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election have been the loudest, claiming without evidence that manipulation has already occurred. Trump, in justifying the move, said in the order that his intention was \u201cto protect election integrity.\u201d",
      "Even some election officials who have vouched for the accuracy of systems that use coded ballots have said it\u2019s time to move on because too many voters don\u2019t trust them.",
      "Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Democrat Jena Griswold, decided in 2019 to stop using ballots with QR codes, saying at the time that voters \u201cshould have the utmost confidence that their vote will count.\u201d Amanda Gonzalez, the elections clerk in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County, doesn't support Trump's order but believes Colorado's decision was a worthwhile step.",

      "Whether voting by mail or in person, millions of voters across the country mark their selections by using a pen to fill in ovals on paper ballots. Those ballots are then fed through a tabulating machine to tally the votes and can be retrieved later if a recount is needed.",
      "In other places, people voting in person use a touch-screen machine to mark their choices and then get a paper record of their votes that includes a barcode or QR code. A tabulator scans the code to tally the vote.",
      "Election officials who use that equipment say it\u2019s secure and that they routinely perform tests to ensure the results match the votes on the paper records, which they retain. The coded ballots have nevertheless become a target of election conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cI think the problem is super exaggerated,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI understand why it can appeal to certain parts of the public who don\u2019t understand the way this works, but I think it\u2019s being used to try to question certain election results in the past.\u201d",
      "Those pushing conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election have latched onto a long-running legal battle over Georgia's voting system. In that case, a University of Michigan computer scientist testified that an attacker could tamper with the QR codes to change voter selections and install malware on the machines.",
      "The testimony from J. Alex Halderman has been used to amplify Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no evidence that any of the weaknesses he found were exploited.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the state's voting system as secure. In March, the judge who presided over Halderman's testimony declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s voting equipment but said the case had \u201cidentified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election executive order is being challenged in multiple lawsuits. One has resulted in a preliminary injunction against a provision that sought to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.",
      "The section banning ballots that use QR or barcodes relies on a Trump directive to a federal agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for voting systems. Not all states follow them.",
      "Some of the lawsuits say Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to direct the commission because it was established by Congress as an independent agency.",
      "While the courts sort that out, the commission\u2019s guidelines say ballots using barcodes or QR codes should include a printed list of the voters\u2019 selections so they can be checked.",
      "Trump\u2019s order exempts voting equipment used by voters with disabilities, but it promises no federal money to help states and counties shift away from systems using QR or barcodes.",
      "\u201cIn the long run, it would be nice if vendors moved away from encoding, but there\u2019s already evidence of them doing that,\u201d said Pamela Smith, president of the group Verified Voting.",
      "Kim Dennison, election coordinator of Benton County, Arkansas, estimated that updating the county's voting system would cost around $400,000 and take up to a year.",
      "Dennison said she has used equipment that relies on coded ballots since she started her job 15 years ago and has never found an inaccurate result during postelection testing.",
      "\u201cI fully and completely trust the equipment is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be doing and not falsifying reports,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot change a vote once it\u2019s been cast.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s Luzerne County, voting machines that produce a QR code will be used in this year\u2019s primary. But officials expect a manufacturer\u2019s update later this year to remove the code before the November elections.",
      "County Manager Romilda Crocamo said officials had not received any complaints from voters about QR codes but decided to make the change when Dominion Voting Systems offered the update.",
      "The nation\u2019s most populous county, Los Angeles, uses a system with a QR code that it developed over a decade and deployed in 2020 after passing a state testing and certification program.",
      "The county\u2019s chief election official, Dean Logan, said the system exceeded federal guidelines at the time and meets many of the standards outlined in the most recent ones approved in 2021. He said postelection audits have consistently confirmed its accuracy.",
      "Modifying or replacing it would be costly and take years, he said. The county\u2019s current voting equipment is valued at $140 million.",
      "Perhaps nowhere has the issue been more contentious than Georgia, a presidential battleground. It uses the same QR code voting system across the state.",
      "Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a lead plaintiff in the litigation over the system, said her group has not taken a position on Trump's executive order but said the federal Election Assistance Commission should stop certifying machines that use barcodes.",
      "The secretary of state said the voting system follows Georgia law, which requires federal certification at the time the system is bought. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled legislature has voted to ban the use of QR codes but did not allocate any money to make the change \u2014 a cost estimated at $66 million.",
      "Republicans said they want to replace the system when the current contract expires in 2028, but their law is still scheduled to take effect next year. GOP state Rep. Victor Anderson said there is no realistic way to \u201cprevent the train wreck that\u2019s coming.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s not really about the books.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has instead morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers, as the White House tries to wrest control of what has for centuries been a legislative institution.",
      "It\u2019s a power struggle with potentially vast consequences. The Library of Congress not only stores the world's largest collection of books but also an office overseeing reams of copyrighted material of untold value.",
      "There is a research institute that has long been protected from outside influence. Its servers house extremely sensitive information regarding claims of workplace violations on Capitol Hill, as well as payments and other financial data for the legislative branch\u2019s more than 30,000 employees. There\u2019s even speculation that the whole affair is tied to an ongoing debate over whether big tech companies can use copyrighted material for artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Because of this, the battle over control of the Library of Congress has prompted Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver rare pushback against a president who has pressed to expand the boundaries of his own power to enact his priorities. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans have been talking with the White House about a potential path to d\u00e9tente.",
      "This all has left the library in a bizarre state of purgatory.",
      "For now, Trump's choices for interim library leaders \u2014 most notably Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general who had represented the president in his criminal proceedings \u2014 have not appeared to challenge the assertion by the library that one of its veteran officials would be the acting head. It would be unheard of for an executive branch official such as Blanche to simultaneously serve in the legislative branch, according to experts.",
      "\u201cThis egregious overreach into the legislature by the executive branch is just unwarranted and, we believe, unprecedented,\u201d said New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which oversees the Library of Congress.",
      "The controversy began to unfold publicly last week, when Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden was fired in a terse email from a White House official. She had just one year left in her 10-year term.",
      "Then this week, Blanche was tapped by the White House to be the interim librarian, and two other Justice Department officials were chosen for other senior library posts. Those officials, Brian Nieves and Paul Perkins, tried unsuccessfully to enter the U.S. Copyright Office on Monday, but left voluntarily after library officials called Capitol Police.",
      "Thune told The Associated Press that Congress was \u201cnot entirely\u201d consulted ahead of Trump\u2019s dismissal of Hayden.",
      "Lawmakers want to ensure that \u201ccongressional legislative branch equities are protected,\u201d Thune said. He speculated that discussions with the White House to resolve the standoff would bleed into next week.",
      "The White House has said Trump was within his authority to dismiss Hayden, a former head of the library systems in Baltimore. It cited \u201cquite concerning\u201d behavior from Hayden involving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as well as books for children that the White House found inappropriate.",
      "A copy of virtually every book published in the U.S. is sent to the Copyright Office, then the library decides whether to include it in the main collection. No one under 16 can get a reader card to access the collection.",
      "Existing regulations and past practices call for an acting librarian to come from the Library of Congress\u2019 current ranks if there is a vacancy. But the White House has argued that a law governing federal vacancies applies, even though the 1998 law deals with the executive branch, according to two people familiar with the discussions.",
      "When Nieves and Perkins showed up on Monday, they held a letter that invoked the vacancies law to justify their appointments, according to one of the people.",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who leads the panel overseeing funding for the Library of Congress, argued that in practice, the librarian is not a legislative branch employee, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an appointment by the president of the United States, because we have to confirm her.\u201d",
      "Yet there is deep concern among lawmakers and aides about any unjustified intrusion of the administration into the Library of Congress and its operations.",
      "Especially worrisome to them is potential meddling with the Congressional Research Service, known as the nonpartisan think tank of Capitol Hill. It fields roughly 75,000 requests from members of Congress every year for research, legal expertise and other information critical for policymaking.",
      "The discussions between lawmakers and the Congressional Research Service are considered so sensitive that they are protected under the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which shields members of Congress from being questioned -\u2013 such as in court -\u2013 about official legislative acts.",
      "The service's \u201cutility and trustworthiness would be substantially undercut if these inquiries were not protected or the Administration sought to shape responses to reflect its priorities,\u201d said Hope O\u2019Keeffe, a former associate general counsel at the Library of Congress.",
      "The library also oversees the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which functions as the human resources office of the legislative branch, fielding complaints about harassment, discrimination and other workplace violations. It also stores financial information about legislative branch employees, who include not just those at the Library of Congress, lawmakers and their aides, but employees of the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, told library staffers shortly after Hayden\u2019s firing that he will serve as the acting librarian. He said in a note this week that while the White House had appointed its own acting librarian, \u201cwe have not yet received direction from Congress about how to move forward,\u201d indicating that the library was defying Trump\u2019s wishes.",
      "California Sen. Alex Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, this week said flatly that Newlen is the acting librarian of Congress. Asked whether Blanche was respecting that, Padilla said, \u201cthat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d",
      "But a White House official stressed on Thursday that Trump selected Blanche to be the acting librarian. The official, granted anonymity because of the ongoing private discussions with lawmakers, said Trump chose Blanche because the president is \u201cappointing highly-qualified individuals who are wholeheartedly committed to advancing the America-first agenda.\" The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Some suspect that the Copyright Office is the true aim of the administration. Housed in the Library of Congress with a leader chosen by the librarian, the office accepts millions of copies of copyrighted material such as books, artwork and music every year as part of the copyright registration process.",
      "Shortly before the director of the office, Shira Perlmutter, was fired, her office released a report that questioned whether it was legal for the tech industry to use copyrighted material to \u201ctrain\u201d their artificial intelligence systems. Tech companies contend that doing so is legal when used for educational or research purposes or creating something new. Perlmutter\u2019s report said doing so, in some circumstances, would go beyond established boundaries of fair use when the AI-generated content is competing with creative works made by people.",
      "The material there is extremely valuable. For instance, copyright violation damages for the office's existing collection \u2014 if, for instance, tech companies scraped the material for AI purposes and then later were found liable for copyright infringement \u2014 would likely exceed $1.5 trillion, according to a person familiar with the calculations.",
      "Morelle noted that the firing came \u201cone day after, and I doubt there\u2019s any coincidence to this, a report which is in many ways at odds with what Elon Musk wants to do around intellectual property and copyright.\u201d Musk is the billionaire outside adviser for Trump who operates his own AI startup, called xAI. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Fortnite says it\u2019s unavailable on Apple\u2019s iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe",
      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, says an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d led its Grok chatbot to post unsolicited claims on social media about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people in South Africa",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company said an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d to its chatbot Grok was the reason why it kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d on social media this week.",
      "An employee at xAI made a change that \u201cdirected Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic,\u201d which \u201cviolated xAI\u2019s internal policies and core values,\u201d the company said in an explanation posted late Thursday that promised reforms.",
      "A day earlier, Grok kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa in response to users of Musk\u2019s social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. It was echoing views shared by Musk, who was born in South Africa and frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself before the fixes were made Wednesday, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Grok's responses were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment but on Thursday, xAI said it had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation\u201d and was implementing new measures to improve Grok's transparency and reliability.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, fueling criticism in the hours between the unauthorized change \u2014 at 3:15 a.m. Pacific time Wednesday \u2014 and the company's explanation nearly two days later.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group that came after Trump suspended refugee programs and halted arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression by the Afrikaner-led apartheid government that ruled South Africa until 1994. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck said it was clear the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Musk's company said it is now making a number of changes, starting with publishing Grok system prompts openly on the software development site GitHub so that \u201cthe public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\u201d",
      "Among the instructions to Grok shown on GitHub on Thursday were: \u201cYou are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media.\u201d",
      "Noting that some had \u201ccircumvented\u201d its existing code review process, xAI also said it will \u201cput in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can\u2019t modify the prompt without review.\u201d The company said it is also putting in place a \u201c24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok\u2019s answers that are not caught by automated systems,\u201d for when other measures fail.",

      "European Union regulators say they\u2019ll seek feedback on Microsoft\u2019s latest proposed changes to Teams to ease competition concerns",
      "BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators will seek public comment on proposed changes from Microsoft for Teams, signaling the U.S. company may be nearing the end of a long-running antitrust case targeting its messaging and videoconferencing app.",
      "Microsoft had previously offered some modifications including unbundling Teams from its Office software suite in an attempt to head off the antitrust probe shortly after it was opened by the EU two years ago.",
      "But those proposals didn't satisfy the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s top competition enforcer, which accused Microsoft last year of potentially abusive behavior.",
      "The Commission said Friday that it will now seek feedback on fresh commitments Microsoft has made to resolve the competition worries. That includes making the Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software packages available at a discount without Teams, and letting customers switch between packages without Teams. The company is also promising to make it easier for rival software to work with Teams and for users to move their data from Teams to to competing products.",
      "The commission said in a press release that it \u201cinvites all interested parties to submit their views\" on Microsoft's proposals. If everyone is satisfied, they would become legally binding.",
      "The Redmond, Wash.-based company is \u201chopeful\u201d the Commission will \u201cin the following months adopt a final decision closing its investigation,\" Microsoft s vice president in charge of European government affairs, Nanna-Louise Linde, said in a blog post.",
      "Microsoft's commitments would be in force for up to 10 years, the Commission said. The company could incur fines worth up to 10% of its annual global revenues \u2014 which could run into tens of billions of euros \u2014 if it fails to honor them",
      "The Teams investigation dates back to 2020, when Slack Technologies, which makes popular workplace messaging software, filed a complaint.",
      "Slack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, alleged that Microsoft was abusing its market dominance to eliminate competition \u2014 in violation of EU laws \u2014 by illegally combining Teams with its Office suite, which includes Word, Excel and Outlook.",
      "Salesforce President Sabastian Niles said the latest announcement \u201caffirms that Microsoft\u2019s anticompetitive practices with Teams have harmed competition and require a binding, enforceable, and effective remedy. We will carefully scrutinize Microsoft\u2019s proposed commitments.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The internet wouldn\u2019t be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The internet wouldn't be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip.",
      "Like it or not, the button has served as a creative catalyst, a dopamine delivery system and an emotional battering ram. It also became an international tourist attraction after Facebook plastered the symbol on a giant sign on that stood outside its Silicon Valley headquarters until the company rebranded itself as Meta Platforms in 2021.",
      "A new book, \u201cLike: The Button That Changed The World,\" delves into the convoluted story behind a symbol that's become both the manna and bane of a digitally driven society.",
      "It's a tale that traces back to gladiator battles for survival during the Roman empire before fast-forwarding to the early 21st century when technology trailblazers such as Yelp co-founder Russ Simmons, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, and Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit were experimenting with different ways using the currency of recognition to prod people to post compelling content online for free.",
      "As part of that noodling, a Yelp employee named Bob Goodson sat down on May 18, 2005, and drew a crude sketch of thumbs up and thumbs down gesture as a way for people to express their opinions about restaurant reviews posted on the site. Yelp passed on adopting Goodson's suggested symbol and, instead, adopted the \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d buttons conceived by Simmons. But the discovery of that old sketch inspired Goodson to team up with Martin Reeves to explore how the Like button came to be in their new book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something simple and also elegant because the Like button says, \u2018I like you, I like your content. And I am like you. I like you because I am like you, I am part of your tribe,\u2019 \u201d Reeves said during an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cBut it's very hard to answer the simple question, \u2018Well, who invented the Like button?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Although Facebook is the main reason the Like button became so ubiquitous, the company didn't invent it and almost discarded it as drivel. It took Facebook nearly two years to overcome the staunch resistance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg before finally introducing the symbol on its service on February 9, 2009 \u2014 five years after the social network's creation in a Harvard University dorm room.",
      "As happens with many innovations, the Like button was born out of necessity but it wasn't the brainchild of a single person. The concept percolated for more than a decade in a Silicon Valley before Facebook finally embraced it.",
      "\u201cInnovation is often social and Silicon Valley was the right place for all this happen because it has a culture of meet-ups, although it's less so now,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEveryone was getting together to talk about what they were working on at that time and it turned out a lot of them were working on the same stuff.\u201d",
      "The effort to create a simple mechanism to digitally express approval or dismay sprouted from a wellspring of online services such as Yelp and YouTube whose success would hinge on their ability to post commentary or video that would help make their sites even more popular without forcing them to spend a lot of money for content. That effort required a feedback loop that wouldn't require a lot of hoops to navigate.",
      "And when Goodson was noodling around with his thumbs-up and thumbs-down gesture, it didn't come out of a vacuum. Those techniques of signaling approval and disapproval had been ushered into the 21st century zeitgeist by the Academy Award-winning movie, \u201cGladiator,\u201d where Emperor Commodus \u2014 portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix \u2014 used the gestures to either spare or slay combatants in the arena.",
      "But the positive feelings conjured by a thumbs up date even further back in popular culture, thanks to the 1950s-era character Fonzie played by Henry Winkler in the top-rated 1970s TV series, \u201cHappy Days.\u201d The gesture later became a way of expressing delight with a program via a remote control button for the digital video recorders made by TiVO during the early 2000s. Around the same time, Hot or Not \u2014 a site that solicited feedback on the looks of people who shared photos of themselves \u2014 began playing around with ideas that helped inspire the Like button, based on the book's research.",
      "Others that contributed to the pool of helpful ideas included the pioneering news service Digg, the blogging platform Xanga, YouTube and another early video site, Vimeo.",
      "But Facebook unquestionably turned the Like button into a universally understood symbol, while also profiting the most from its entrance into the mainstream. And it almost didn't happen.",
      "By 2007, Facebook engineers had been tinkering with a Like button, but Zuckerberg opposed it because he feared the social network was already getting too cluttered and, Reeves said, \u201cis he didn\u2019t actually want to do something that would be seen as trivial, that would cheapen the service.\u201d",
      "But FriendFeed, a rival social network created by Buchheit and now OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, had no such qualms, and unveiled its own Like button in October 2007.",
      "But the button wasn't successful enough to keep the lights on at FriendFeed, and the service ended up being acquired by Facebook. By the time that deal was completed, Facebook had already introduced a Like button \u2014 only after Zuckerberg rebuffed the original idea of calling it an Awesome button \u201cbecause nothing is more awesome than awesome,\u201d according to the book's research.",
      "Once Zuckerberg relented, Facebook quickly saw that the Like button not only helped keep its audience engaged on its social network but also made it easier to divine people's individual interests and gather the insights required to sell the targeted advertising that accounted for most of Meta Platform's $165 billion in revenue last year. The button's success encouraged Facebook to take things even further by allowing other digital services to ingrain it into their feedback loops and then, in 2016, added six more types of emotions \u2014 \u201clove,\u201d \u201ccare,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d \u201cwow,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d",
      "Facebook hasn't publicly disclosed how many responses it has accumulated from the Like button and its other related options, but Levchin told the book's authors that he believes the company has probably logged trillions of them. \u201cWhat content is liked by humans...is probably one of the singularly most valuable things on the internet,\u201d Levchin said in the book.",
      "The Like button also has created an epidemic of emotional problems, especially among adolescents, who feel forlorn if their posts are ignored and narcissists whose egos feast on the positive feedback. Reeves views those issues as part of the unintentional consequences that inevitably happen because \u201cif you can\u2019t even predict the beneficial effects of a technological innovation how could you possibly forecast the side effects and the interventions?\u201d",
      "Even so, Reeves believes the Like button and the forces that coalesced to create it tapped into something uniquely human.",
      "\u201cWe thought serendipity of the innovation was part of the point,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can get bored with liking or having our capacity to compliment taken away so easily because it\u2019s the product of 100,000 years of evolution.\u201d",

      "A 29-year-old former tire shop manager who quit his job and cashed in his retirement savings to buy a sailboat has become a social media sensation as he sails from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix",
      "HONOLULU -- Midway while sailing across the Pacific with just his cat named Phoenix, Oliver Widger reflected on why he thinks his many followers \u2014 more than a million on TikTok and Instagram \u2014 are drawn to his story of quitting his 9-to-5 job and embarking on a journey from Oregon to Hawaii.",
      "\u201cThe world kind of sucks and, like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in how I felt with my work,\u201d Widger, 29, told The Associated Press on Wednesday via Zoom. \u201cYou can be making $150,000 a year and you still feel like you\u2019re just making ends meet, you know what I mean? And I think people are just tired of that and working really hard for nothing and want a way out.\"",
      "People are inspired by someone who found a way out, said Widger, who is among a growing number of people who have undertaken such voyages in recent years.",
      "Being diagnosed four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis made him realize he hated his job as a manager at a tire company, a job requiring him to be clean-shaven and wear pressed shirts. He heard about people who sailed from California to Hawaii and decided that was the life for him.",
      "He abruptly quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt.",
      "\u201cI knew one thing: I'm buying a sailboat,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI'm sailing around the world.\u201d",
      "He liquidated his retirement savings, taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast, where he spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.",
      "Now, Widger is harnessing the power of social media to fund his round-the-world sailing dream.",
      "Since he set sail in April, followers have been tuning into his \u201cSailing with Phoenix\u201d social media posts to view videos of him and his feline first mate battling the waves and bouts of seasickness, enjoying dazzling sunsets, recounting tricky boat repairs or just reflecting on life at sea.",
      "As he discussed his journey with the AP, a netted bag carrying bottled water and snacks swung wildly over his head as the boat rocked.",
      "He recalled highlights of the voyage so far, including marveling at the speed dolphins cut through the water and finding flying fish on the deck. There have been stretches when there were no birds in sight for days. It can be a struggle to sleep when the boat is creaking while being buffeted by waves or to steady a boiling pot for the MREs he has been subsisting on.",
      "There have been harrowing moments like when a rudder failed and the boat tilted sideways in the surf for three hours as he made repairs, and the time he locked himself in the engine compartment and pried his way out with a wrench.",
      "Widger acknowledged he is relatively inexperienced as a sailor, but he has implemented safety measures and communication backup plans, including a satellite phone and an emergency beacon.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Jesse Harms of the U.S. Coast Guard in Hawaii hasn't been following the journey closely, but said he is relieved to hear Widger has the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, known as an EPIRB.",
      "It's a critical tool for rescuers to locate a mariner's position during an emergency, especially in the Pacific, the largest ocean, Harms said.",
      "Widger's journey provides a good opportunity to educate the public about sailing safety, such as the importance of wearing a personal flotation device whenever topside on the boat, monitoring the weather closely and registering emergency tools like the EPIRB, Harms said.",
      "\u201cThat's a really critical piece for anybody that's getting motivated by his story to go set off on their own adventure,\u201d Harms said.",
      "Until his arrival, likely in Honolulu, Widger is making sure everything is in place to avoid Phoenix having to undergo Hawaii's animal quarantine. A mobile vet will sign off on Phoenix's health when they arrive, he said.",
      "Widger wasn't aware of the deadly danger of cat feces to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, but he has been keeping all his trash, including kitty litter, on board. Even though he said he is legally allowed to throw it overboard, seeing so much plastic in the ocean motivates him not to.",
      "In addition to managing the practicalities of daily life on a boat, he is coping with going viral in the middle of the ocean by creating social media content and making decisions about merch his fans want to buy.",
      "He credits it all to his neck issue, which \u201cshook up my world and it changed my perspective on everything.\u201d He also hopes he can be an inspiration for anyone who's in a rut.",
      "\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done I thought was impossible,\u201d Widger said. \"Sailing around the world is such a ridiculous dream. Whatever your dream is, just go, just do it.\u201d",

      "The order from Judge Joun -- a Biden appointee -- also prohibits the Department of Education from transferring the management of federal student loans to the Small Business Administration.",
      "The decision marks the first time a federal judge has determined the Trump administration's sweeping changes to the Department of Education are unlawful.",
      "For now, the order puts a stop to the Trump administration's effort to fire more than 2,000 Department of Education employees, transfer federal student loan obligations, and otherwise implement the president's March 20 executive order to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.\"",
      "A group that includes several state attorneys general, schools, and nonprofits challenged Trump's efforts to reduce the size of the Department of Education last month, arguing the president cannot unilaterally shut down a federal department created by Congress.",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the efforts to reduce the Department of Education would make it more efficient, and were separate from Trump's vow to abolish the department.",
      "Judge Joun was unconvinced. His decision offered a blistering assessment of the Trump administration's claim that recent changes to the Department of Education are to improve efficiency, rather than carry out Trump's vow to abolish the Department outright.",
      "\"The idea that Defendants' actions are merely a 'reorganization' is plainly not true,\" he wrote.",
      "The changes imposed by Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Judge Joun wrote, \"effectively impossible for the Department to carry out its statutorily mandated functions.\"",
      "Though Trump has the authority to remove executive officers, the president does not have the power to dismantle entire federal departments outright, he wrote. He also cast doubt on the claim that the legislative effort to abolish the Department of Education was separate from his executive actions.",
      "\"Not only is there no evidence that Defendants are pursuing a 'legislative goal' or otherwise working with Congress to reach a resolution, but there is also no evidence that the RIF has actually made the Department more efficient. Rather, the record is replete with evidence of the opposite,\" the judge wrote, referring to the \"reduction in force\" firings.",
      "\"Consolidated Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the Department will not be able to carry out its statutory functions -- and in some cases, is already unable to do so -- and Defendants have proffered no evidence to the contrary,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Today's order means that the Trump administration's disastrous mass firings of career civil servants are blocked while this wildly disruptive and unlawful agency action is litigated,\" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which represented several of the plaintiffs. \"Instead of taking a wrecking ball to our nation's best values and our chance at a better future, this administration should be focused on how to improve education and opportunities for all.\"",
      "\"Today, the court rightly rejected one of the administration's very first illegal, and consequential, acts: abolishing the federal role in education,\" American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said of the ruling. \"The vast majority of Americans and states like Massachusetts, with the highest NAEP scores, want to keep the education department because it ensures all kids, not just some, can get a shot at a better life.\"",

      "Khalil\u2019s attorneys are prepared to argue on a number of issues before the court, including his pending request for asylum, their motion to dismiss the case because they allege he was illegally detained without a warrant, their motion for continuance, and the second set of charges that the Department of Homeland Security claims makes him deportable, which center around their accusation that he lied on his green card application.",
      "But ultimately the decision of what to discuss at the hearing will be up to Immigration Judge Jamee Comans, who last month ruled Khalil deportable based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's assertion that his continued presence and actions in the country poses \"adverse foreign policy consequence.\"",
      "She did not ask to review any evidence backing those claims.",
      "Comans has not yet ruled on the second set of allegations regarding his green card application, which Khalil\u2019s lawyers say are largely based on conservative tabloids. They recently submitted several documents and declarations from his previous employers that they say prove he did not misrepresent his employment history.",
      "Khalil himself may also testify about why he believes his life could be at risk if he is denied asylum or if he is deported to Algeria or Syria as the government says it wants to do.",

      "Khalil\u2019s wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, who recently gave birth to the couple's son, was expected to attend the hearing. It would be the first time Khalil will see his son in person after he was born on April 21.",
      "On Wednesday, Khalil\u2019s lawyers asked a federal judge to intervene and allow Khalil, his wife, and newborn son to meet without plexiglass separating them. The judge ordered the facility to allow Khalil, his wife, and counsel to meet together to discuss his habeas petition.",

    "summary": "Jack Teixeira spoke from prison, where he is serving a 15-year sentence for what prosecutors called one of the most significant leaks of U.S. national defense secrets.",
    "story": [
      "Teixeira is serving 15 years in federal prison after pleading guilty.",
      "In an exclusive interview from federal prison, where he is currently serving a 15-year sentence for what prosecutors called one of the most significant leaks of U.S. national defense secrets, Jack Teixeira spoke out for the first time since his arrest more than two years ago -- telling ABC News he doesn't feel he betrayed his country and would commit the same acts again if he had the chance to do things over.",
      "The 23-year-old said he is also appealing to President Donald Trump for a pardon in what he called a \"politicized\" case under the Biden administration.",
      "\"My intent was to educate the United States populist people about what was going on. It was not to harm the United States or the country because I love my nation. I'm a patriot,\" Teixeira told ABC News over the phone from a medium security federal correctional institution in Virginia. \"It was by no means meant to harm my country, but I did believe that I needed to educate the people about what was going on because I believe they were being lied to.\"",
      "Watch \"Good Morning America\" at 7 a.m. ET for more from the interview with Jack Teixeira and his mother, Dawn Dufault.",
      "He said he believes that mission was accomplished \"to a significant degree.\"",
      "\"I don't feel that I betrayed my country at all, just the opposite,\" he said. \"I believe that I educated a lot of the people who have been kept in the dark and who were being lied to about this concerning all of the things that had been going on.\"",
      "Prosecutors say that while serving as a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman, Teixeira abused his top-secret clearance and accessed and posted images of hundreds of classified documents, including ones related to troop movements in Ukraine and details of the Chinese spy balloons, on the gaming platform Discord. Another document shared included \"discussing a plot by a foreign adversary to target United States forces abroad,\" according to the indictment.",
      "The FBI said his actions created \"exceptionally grave and long-lasting damage to the national security of the United States,\" while then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said Teixeira \"endangered our country's national security and that of our allies\" when he repeatedly shared classified national defense information online \"in an attempt to impress anonymous friends on the internet.\"",
      "Teixeira pleaded guilty last year to six federal counts of willfully retaining and transmitting national defense information. In exchange, prosecutors agreed not to charge him with additional counts under the Espionage Act.",
      "He also pleaded guilty to a military charge of obstructing justice during a military court-martial this year, avoiding any additional confinement and receiving a dishonorable discharge as part of his plea agreement.",
      "Following the sentencing in the federal case, Joshua Levy, then-acting U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said Teixeira \"abused his position of trust\" and put himself above his country when he exploited his top-secret clearance and \"made the deliberate choice\" for over a year to access hundreds of classified documents and share them on Discord. This \"significant sentence sends a powerful message to every individual who holds a top-secret clearance,\" Levy said.",
      "Then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement that the sentence is a \"stark warning to all those entrusted with protecting national defense information: betray that trust, and you will be held accountable.\"",
      "'I still believe in my actions'",
      "As he serves his federal sentence, Teixeira maintains no one was harmed by his actions. He said his apology in a statement during his sentencing in federal court was meant for his family and friends and how this has impacted them.",
      "\"I still believe in my actions,\" he said.",
      "Teixeira said he believes his case was politicized and that he doesn't deserve 15 years behind bars.",
      "\"I just feel like there are people who have done far worse things as far as what they did with similar information, and they didn't get as bad of a treatment as I did,\" he said. \"But my case was specifically politicized by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"I think that I was used as a sacrificial lamb, and I was crucified to be made of as an example,\" he continued.",
      "While serving as an information technology specialist, Teixeira used a secure workstation at his Massachusetts base to conduct hundreds of searches for classified documents related to national defense information that were unrelated to his duties, prosecutors said.",
      "Asked why he disregarded his training and leaked classified information, Teixeira said, \"I believe that a lot of people and a lot of different people would determine what secrets should be kept, and I'm not entirely sure how fair that was. Because at least from what I had witnessed and what I have exposed, a lot of these things should have been shown to the American people and not kept secret from them. So I had a little bit of a disagreement with some of those policies, I guess you could say.\"",
      "Despite warnings from his superiors to stop conducting \"deep dives\" into classified intelligence information, he \"purposefully and repeatedly removed classified information and documents containing NDI without authorization,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Pressed on why he continued to access information outside the scope of his duties despite being told to stop, Teixeira claimed he was encouraged to do the \"exact opposite to those directives\" and to \"do our due diligence and look at what we're supporting and why we're support it and what's going on.\"",

      "\"I felt like at the time when I was being admonished for following a directive that I was given by a superior, so it was just a clash of things that I believed was contradictory,\" he said.",
      "Teixeira didn't go into specifics, but said he believed there were \"lies\" being propagated about what was going on concerning the \"tactical and strategic aspect\" of the Russia-Ukraine war and the U.S. assistance to Ukraine.",
      "\"A lot of the things that the administration at the time was saying was wrong, it was misleading, it was outright false, or it was skewed, and essentially just, I wanted people to know exactly what was going on so that no one could say, 'Well, it was like this because the history book or the history textbook said it was,''' he said. \"I just wanted to show an unvarnished take on everything that was going on.\"",
      "Despite the 15-year sentence, he said he wouldn't change what he did.",
      "\"I've tortured myself over and over and over again about what would happen if I didn't do this, or what would happen if this and that. And in reality, it doesn't really matter,\" he said. \"I still do believe that, yes, I would have done it again.\"",
      "Teixeira said his lawyers are working on trying to get a pardon petition through to Trump, and that he believes he will be pardoned.",
      "\"I think they'll look at someone like me as a supporter and someone who really used what I thought was going to be my last vote in county jail for Trump during 2024. And I just, I believe that indeed he will,\" he said.",
      "An attorney for Teixeira filed an application for a pardon on Wednesday. Such a request is typically submitted after a federal sentence has been completed, though his application notes that he is seeking a full pardon rather than only a commutation of his sentence. Ultimately, it will be up to the Trump administration to approve or deny his petition.",
      "Teixeira appealed to Trump to \"please give me back to my family, to reunite with my family with my rights as an American and with my freedom.\"",
      "Teixeira's mother speaks out for 1st time, too",
      "Teixeira's mother, Dawn Dufault, also appealed to Trump in her first interview since her son's arrest in April 2023, saying she thought his prosecution was \"malicious\" and the case \"sensationalized.\"",
      "\"He didn't do it to harm the country,\" Dufault told ABC News in an exclusive interview in Boston. \"They told the public that they were going to make an example out of Jack.\"",
      "She said she wants Trump to look into the case and \"look at how my son was treated.\"",
      "\"If he agrees that it was unfair treatment, give him a pardon,\" she said.",
      "Dufault reflected on her son's arrest, saying, \"It was a complete surprise to me.\"",
      "\"That morning, the New York Times reporters came down my driveway asking to see him. That was the first inkling I had that anything was awry,\" she said. \"We had been watching on the news, the stories, they were trying to find this person leaking documents. No idea. And that was April 13, that this all kind of kicked off. At that time, they had asked, they said that they were going to run an article naming him as the leaker. I still didn't believe it. It was unbelievable to me.\"",
      "Dufault said she still has questions about why her son did what he did, but she doesn't believe him to be a threat.",
      "She said she believed her son was \"compelled to tell the truth\" and made the choice to share the classified documents with friends on Discord. She added that Teixeira was also recently diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, and has obsessive-compulsive disorder, which she said she thinks may also have been a factor in his actions.",
      "\"I think that that also played into his compulsion to go against his oath that he took to the government,\" she said. \"I feel like part of it was possibly uncontrollable because of what we now know is autism.\"",
      "Dufault said Teixeira comes from a military family, and they are concerned about national security in the wake of the leak.",
      "\"How has it improved? Could this happen again? Is anybody looking at that? Does anybody care? It was focused heavily on Jack's character versus what actually happened, how it happened, and what could be done to improve the security of our national secrets,\" she said. \"We love this country. We love the government. We're not conspiracy theorists. But I feel like more needs to be done to look into what happened.\"",
      "An Air Force Inspector General investigation found that individuals in Teixeira's unit \"failed to take proper action after becoming aware of his intelligence-seeking activities\" but that there was no evidence that members of his supervisory chain were aware of the unauthorized disclosures. Fifteen individuals received disciplinary and other administrative actions for \"dereliction in the performance of duties,\" and the Department of the Air Force said it implemented several reforms to improve the protection of classified and sensitive information.",
      "Dufault described her son as a \"good kid\" who has changed since his arrest, becoming more self-aware and appreciative of his family.",
      "\"I think he needs a second chance,\" she said. \"I think he's still destined for something great. I always have, and I still feel that way.\"",

      "The report blames chronic illnesses on things such as ultra-processed foods.",
      "The White House's Make America Healthy Again Commission offered a range of critiques about chronic disease in America in a report released Thursday,",
      "Chiefly, the report blames many chronic illnesses on ultra-processed foods, sedentary behavior and over-reliance on digital devices among children and chemicals in the environment. It also suggests childhood vaccines need to be studied further.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who leads the commission, told reporters on a call Thursday that the report is the \"most radical consensus by a government agency in history about the state of America's health.\"",
      "\"It is very strong. It's very frank, and it is a clarion call to do something with utmost urgency to end this crisis, and that's what we wanted,\" Kennedy said.",
      "However, the 69-page document leaves many questions unanswered, including how much it will cost to address the chronic illnesses that Kennedy is focused on and what steps might be taken to curtail them.",
      "Kennedy told reporters that the commission doesn't yet have a budget to fund the future health initiatives, noting officials plan to develop policy recommendations in the next 100 days.",
      "\"There is no budge,\" Kennedy said. \"At this point, there's no concrete policy that could be funded in a budget. We're going to work out the policy recommendations over the next 100 days.\"",
      "\"The next stage of this process is to come up with policy recommendations for the president, and then we'll spend the next four years implementing those policy recommendations,\" he continued.",
      "Despite the lack of budget details, Kennedy maintained that addressing the chronic health issues would save money in the long term.",
      "\"We're going to save a lot more money in the long run and even in the short run, we can reduce the numbers, which we intend to do during this administration,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Officials including Calley Means, a special government employee and adviser to Kennedy who has fought against the presence of ultra-processed foods and pesticides, praised the report.",
      "\"The fact that an official U.S. government document \u2026 gives credibility to complaints about pesticides and names specific pesticides in there is a monumental symbol,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Though the officials largely highlighted improving Americans' diet, which Kennedy said President Donald Trump had directed the commission to look into, Kennedy also emphasized \"exposure to toxic chemicals, a lack of physical activity and chronic stress and over-medicalization.\"",
      "He said these factors have made American children \"the sickest kids in the world.\"",
      "On the issue of pesticides in food -- which found a lot of industry pushback in the last few weeks as the report neared its due date -- Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, who both have more direct oversight than Kennedy over the industry, were careful to ensure that farmers would not face any surprises.",
      "While Kennedy and others in the MAHA movement have questioned the safety or health of the ingredients in foods on store shelves, Rollins stressed that the U.S. food supply remains safe.",
      "\"The food supply is 100% safe,\" Rollins said. \"It isn't just safe. It is the safest in the world. And it's really, really important that we continue to make sure that people understand that,\" she added.",
      "Rollins pledged that Kennedy and the MAHA Commission will not \"compromise the ability of our American agriculture to do what they do best,\" and Zeldin said that any moves to regulate pesticides would be carefully considered against the cost to farmers.",
      "\"American farmers rely on these products, and actions that further regulate or restrict crop protection tools, beyond risk-based and scientific processes set forth by Congress, must involve thoughtful consideration of what is necessary for adequate protection, alternatives and cost of production,\" he said.",
      "Zeldin added that any quick changes in agricultural practices could have \"adverse impact on American agriculture and the domestic food supply.\"",
      "The report also calls for new studies on childhood vaccines, which dozens of high-quality studies have found to be safe and effective.",
      "Although the report states that vaccines protect children from infectious diseases, it also claims parents are concerned about their \"appropriate use\" and their \"possible role\" in chronic diseases among children.",
      "\"Despite the growth of the childhood vaccine schedule, there has been limited scientific inquiry into the links between vaccines and chronic disease, the impacts of vaccine injury, and conflicts of interest in the development of the vaccine schedule. These areas warrant future inquiry,\" the report states.",
      "Dozens of studies have failed to find a link between an increased number of vaccines and more chronic disease among children.",

      "After a bitter loss to President Donald Trump, former Vice President Kamala Harris is thinking hard about her next job",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Many of Kamala Harris\u2019 supporters and detractors alike think she'd have better odds running for California governor rather than president a third time.",
      "There are several reasons for Harris to make a bid to replace term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom. She would immediately become the early front-runner instead of entering a presidential primary with a dozen or more serious contenders. No other candidate in California could match her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of having served as San Francisco district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president.",
      "Beyond being expected to make a decision by the end of summer, Harris said little about her future. She told a crowd in Orange County in April: \u201cI\u2019ll see you out there. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Newsom has predicted that Harris would top the field in a contested primary but added, \u201cif she runs.\u201d",
      "To run for governor, \u201cyou have to have a burning \u2018Why?\u2019 \u201d Newsom said on the \u201cNext Up with Mark Halperin\u201d podcast.",
      "\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t enunciate that, the answer is \u2018No,\u2019\u201d Newsom added. \u201cWhy the hell would you want this job?\u201d",
      "Here are some reasons why she might want it \u2014 and why she might not. Her office did not respond to requests for comment for this story.",
      "Harris would have to convince national Democrats that she's the face of the party\u2019s future, despite losing to President Donald Trump last fall. She's also tied to former President Joe Biden, whom Democrats are increasingly criticizing as new books drive further discussion about his age and physical and mental readiness during his time in office.",
      "The 2028 presidential contest is expected to attract a large field, likely to include Newsom. Any candidate will have to unify a fractious Democratic Party with low approval ratings and struggling to slow Trump\u2019s agenda in Washington.",
      "Democratic consultant Bill Burton, who was national press secretary for former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, said Harris would enter a presidential primary with a proven fundraising network, strong recognition with voters and the experience of operating in a Trump-fueled media environment.",
      "But the looming question for Democrats is likely to be, \u201cWho is the best person to stand up to the MAGA movement and exhibit a strength that is going to need to be really formidable?\u201d Burton said.",
      "Could Harris make that case? Some think her time has passed.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s had her chance,\u201d Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cVoters want authentic outsiders who will shake up our broken political system and challenge an economic status quo rigged for billionaires against working people,\" Green added. \u201cThat\u2019s why Kamala Harris lost, and it\u2019s why Democrats must turn elsewhere for leadership.\u201d",
      "Harris calls herself a proud daughter of California, and after serving as vice president and in the Senate, she doesn\u2019t need to chase another title. That said, California is one of the world\u2019s largest economies by itself, and its governor becomes, by default, a national figure.",
      "She would most likely run as a proven hand with the experience to lead California\u2019s tussles with Trump \u2014 the state is known as the epicenter of the so-called Trump resistance \u2014 while dealing with its many problems, among them homelessness and a punishing cost of living.",
      "In her San Francisco speech last month, she said the nation was witnessing a \u201cwholesale abandonment\u201d of American ideals under Trump.",
      "The contest to replace Newsom in California is crowded, with leading candidates including former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Biden administration health secretary Xavier Becerra.",
      "It\u2019s expected that at least some of her rival Democrats would bow out rather than compete against her, including Porter, who in 2012 was appointed by then-attorney general Harris to be the state\u2019s independent bank monitor in a multibillion-dollar nationwide mortgage settlement.",
      "Democratic consultant Roger Salazar, who was a delegate in the party\u2019s 2024 presidential convention, said Harris would stand better odds in a race for governor in her home state.",
      "With multiple election wins in California, \u201cthere is just more certainty,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cI think she\u2019s got a leg up right now, but this race hasn\u2019t solidified\u201d with the primary more than a year away.",
      "How will voters view her? As a favorite daughter of California returning home? Or a two-time presidential also-ran looking for a soft landing?",
      "Republican consultant Kevin Madden, who was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, was dubious about her chances in either race. It's unusual for a candidate to capture the presidency after two losses \u2014 Biden was one example.",
      "As for governor, \u201cthe California electorate is about as ideal as it gets for Harris, but nothing about her current electoral record indicates that primary or general election candidates should be scared off,\u201d Madden added.",
      "Unlike many other states, California doesn't automatically advance a Democrat and a Republican to the November election.",
      "The state\u2019s open primary system has tormented many candidates \u2014 critics call it the \u201cjungle primary.\u201d All candidates appear on a single ballot, regardless of party, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election.",
      "The system can lead to strategic gambles. Last year\u2019s U.S. Senate race included three prominent Democrats \u2014 U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Porter and Barbara Lee. Schiff ran TV ads in the primary that spotlighted Republican Steve Garvey, presumably a weaker contender in the general election than either of his Democratic rivals. Garvey ended up advancing to November, where he was soundly defeated by Schiff, who now holds the seat.",
      "But Harris could come out of the June 2, 2026, primary facing a Democrat who ends up criticizing her in much the same way she'd have faced in a 2028 bid.",
      "San Francisco-based Democratic consultant Eric Jaye recalled another Californian who, after losing a presidential race, sought to rebound in his home state: Richard Nixon. After being narrowly defeated in the 1960 election by then-Sen. John F. Kennedy, Nixon lost the 1962 race for California governor. (Of course, Nixon ended up winning the White House six years later.)",
      "While Harris is a favorite with Democrats, a slice of the electorate has deeply negative views of her, Jaye noted. That doesn\u2019t leave her with many voters to gain, and the Democratic primary vote could be divided among multiple candidates.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in any way guaranteed that she would win,\u201d Jaye said. \u201cShe\u2019s a highly polarizing figure.\u201d",
      "Harris would be coming home to a long list of problems.",
      "The homeless crisis is playing out daily on the streets of Los Angeles and other big cities. Newsom this month said the state is facing a $12 billion deficit and he wants to freeze enrollment in a state-funded health care program for immigrants living in California without legal status. There is a home insurance crisis and a continuing threat from destructive wildfires.",
      "And as the last election made clear, Republicans will attempt to saddle her \u2014 fairly or not \u2014 with her home state\u2019s reputation for confiscatory taxes, gas prices and utility bills, seven-figure home prices and liberal social policies.",

    "summary": "Trump hosted South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House amid tensions between the two nations over the U.S. resettlement of white South Africans.",
    "story": [
      "In the Oval Office, Trump showed videos and articles he said proved his claims.",
      "President Donald Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa engaged in a tense back-and-forth at the White House on Wednesday over Trump's false claims of \"genocide\" against white South African farmers.",
      "In a rare scene in the Oval Office, Trump had the lights dimmed to play videos on a TV monitor he said supported his allegations. Ramaphosa appeared surprised at the ambush and at times said he hadn't seen what was being aired. The sourcing of the videos played remain unknown.",
      "South Africa's presidential spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, later told ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang it was a \"poor compilation of old videos\" and a \"complete lie.\"",
      "Trump also held up what he said were news articles about violent attacks against white Afrikaner farmers.",
      "\"I don't know, all of these are articles over the last few days, death of people, death, death, death, horrible death,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump claimed White South Africans were \"fleeing because of the violence and the racist laws.\"",
      "\"This is sort of the opposite of apartheid. What's happening now is never reported. Nobody knows about it,\" he added.",
      "Ramaphosa pushed back, saying the clips of speeches Trump played \"is not government policy.\" He and other members of the South African delegation said the speakers and their views were part of extremist fringe political groups.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country. People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity are not only white people, majority of them are Black people,\" Ramaphosa said.",
      "The South African leader said it would take Trump \"listening to the voices of South Africans\" to change his view. The South African government has vehemently disputed accusations of genocide.",
      "\"I would say if there was Afrikaner farmer genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen would not be here, including my minister of agriculture,\" Ramaphosa said. \"He would not be with me. So, it'll take him, President Trump, listening to their stories, to their perspective.\"",
      "Later Wednesday, Ramaphosa told reporters \"there is just no genocide in South Africa.\"",
      "Ramaphosa said that much of the violence in South Africa is because of its struggling economy, and \"when the economy is not growing, when there's poverty, when there's unemployment, one of the social ills that we get as a derivative is criminality that spreads itself around the countries, not only on farms or rural areas, it's even in urban areas.\"",
      "\"The issue of whether what he terms as genocide can be equated to the struggle,\" he said. \"And of course it cannot, because there is just no genocide in South Africa. And and of course it is an issue of how one looks at it.\"",
      "\"We require more investment from the United States and we require a more positive disposition from the United States,\" Ramaphosa said.",
      "At times, Ramaphosa sought to steer the conversation with Trump back to trade and economic investment, which he said was the \"real reason for being here.\" But Trump continually talked about the treatment of White South Africans.",
      "But when pressed on what he wants Ramaphosa and his government to do, Trump conceded, \"I don't know.\"",
      "The spokesperson for the South African president told ABC's Wang that Ramaphosa \"expected\" to be confronted with a \"show\" from President Trump.",
      "\"You saw how calm President Ramaphosa remained the whole time -- that should tell you it didn't come as a surprise. At no point did he lose his cool \u2013 he remained elegant, dignified,\" Magwenya said.",
      "Elon Musk, a South African native and a top adviser to the president during his second term who has also amplified false claims of \"white genocide,\" was present for Ramaphosa's visit to the White House.",
      "Musk was seen standing behind a couch and did not speak during the exchange between Ramaphosa and Trump.",
      "\"Elon is from South Africa. I don't want to get him involved,\" Trump said. \"That's all I have to do. Get him into another thing. But Elon happens to be from South Africa.\"",
      "\"This is what Elon wanted,\" Trump said, chuckling.",
      "Dozens of Afrikaner refugees arrived in the U.S. last week after having their applications fast-tracked under an executive order issued by Trump in February titled, \"Addressing Egregious Actions of the Republic of South Africa.\"",
      "The order contends the South African government passed a law allowing it to \"seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation\" in a \"shocking disregard of its' citizen rights.\" It instructs that the U.S. will not provide aid or assistance to the nation, and that the U.S. \"promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees.\"",
      "The law passed by South Africa cited by the administration aims to address land injustices established during apartheid. It states land can be expropriated in the public interest and in most cases must be subject to compensation, the amount of which must have been agreed to by the owners or approved by court. Experts say the law is comparable to similar legislation around the world regarding eminent domain.",
      "Ramaphosa previously said that the White South Africans who are being resettled in the U.S. \"do not fit the definition of a refugee\" -- someone who is leaving their country out of fear of being persecuted based on race, religion, nationality or political affiliation.",
      "Trump has been scrutinized for prioritizing Afrikaners while moving to restrict immigration from elsewhere, including from Afghanistan, Venezuela and Haiti.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio was asked to defend the administration's position while testifying before a Senate panel on Tuesday.",
      "\"I think those 49 people that came strongly felt they were persecuted, and they passed every sort of check mark that needed to be checked off,\" Rubio said. \"The president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said he believed the claim there is persecution of Afrikaner farmers was \"completely specious\" and noted the U.S. hadn't let in Black South Africans during apartheid.",
      "\"I think that the United States has a right to allow into this country and prioritize the allowance of who they want to allow it come in,\" Rubio responded.",

    "story": [
      "The president said the anti-missile shield would be operational by 2029.",
      "LONDON -- The Chinese Foreign Ministry accused President Donald Trump of undermining \"global strategic balance and stability\" by pushing ahead on his \"Golden Dome\" missile defense shield program -- and urged the U.S. to abandon the project.",
      "Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the project at an Oval Office briefing on Tuesday, confirming reports that the administration was seeking to establish a missile defense umbrella the president said would be capable of \"intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space.\"",
      "The project will cost around $175 billion and be operational in three years, Trump said.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters at a Wednesday briefing that the proposed shield will \"heighten the risk of turning the space into a war zone and creating a space arms race and shake the international security and arms control system,\" according to a readout posted to the ministry's website.",
      "\"It plans to expand the U.S. arsenal of means for combat operations in outer space, including R&D and deployment of orbital interception systems,\" Mao said.",
      "\"That gives the project a strong offensive nature and violates the principle of peaceful use in the Outer Space Treaty,\" she added, referring to the 1967 agreement which -- among other things -- prohibited the use of nuclear weapons in space and limited any usage of all \"celestial bodies\" for peaceful purposes.",
      "\"This is yet another 'America First' initiative that puts the U.S.' absolute security above all else,\" Mao continued. \"It violates the principle of 'undiminished security for all' and will hurt global strategic balance and stability,\" she said. \"China is gravely concerned.\"",
      "\"We urge the U.S. to give up developing and deploying global anti-missile system, and take concrete actions to enhance strategic trust between major countries and uphold global strategic stability,\" Mao said.",
      "Trump began calling for a U.S. missile defense shield inspired by Israel's Iron Dome -- which is used to intercept short-range projectiles -- a year ago on the campaign trail after watching Israel and its Western allies defeat some 300 missiles and drones fired during an attack by Iran. The attack was thwarted by a range of anti-missile systems and military aircraft.",
      "Military officials said at the time that they hadn't expressed a need for such a comprehensive shield to defend the U.S. Critics of Trump's plan noted the U.S. wasn't under threat from its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, and is buffered by two oceans.",
      "The \"Golden Dome\" project has echoes of the failed Cold War-era \"Star Wars\" program, which likewise sought to introduce a defense umbrella against nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. At the time, critics -- including leaders in the Soviet Union -- said such a project was both unworkable and could spark a new arms race.",

      "The White House has argued Trump has plenary power on immigration.",
      "During a wide-ranging podcast interview with the New York Times posted Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance said Chief Justice John Roberts was \u201cprofoundly wrong\u201d for recent comments he made on the Supreme Court's role to check the excesses of the executive.",
      "\"I thought that was a profoundly wrong sentiment. That's one half of his job. The other half of his job is to check the excesses of his own branch,\" Vance stated. \"You cannot have a country where the American people keep on electing immigration enforcement and the courts tell the American people they're not allowed to have what they voted for. That's where we are right now,\" Vance continued.",
      "Vance's comments occurred while discussing the administration's immigration policies and initiatives, which have been met with swift legal actions. Vance said the White House believes Trump \"has extraordinary plenary power.\"",
      "\"I think that you are seeing, and I know this is inflammatory, but I think you are seeing an effort by the courts to quite literally overturn the will of the American people. To be clear, it's not most courts,\" Vance said.",
      "Earlier this month, Roberts gave remarks in Buffalo, New York, where he stressed the importance of judicial independence and how the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government.",
      "\"In our Constitution, judges and the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government, separate from the others with the authority to interpret the Constitution as law and strike down, obviously, acts of Congress or acts of the president,\" Roberts said. \"And that innovation doesn't work if it's not the judiciary is not independent. Its job is to obviously decide cases, but in the course of that, check the excesses of Congress or of the executive, and that does require a degree of independence.\"",
      "Vance's comments are part of a larger argument the White House has been making for months -- that the president has the executive authority to enact immigration policies, regardless of what the courts may say.",
      "On Friday, the Supreme Court extended its injunction that temporarily bars the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act proclamation and sent the case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to resolve the question of how much time should be afforded for detainees to contest their removals.",
      "Discussing the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, Vance defended the White House's use of the act and said that the courts need to be \"extremely deferential.\"",
      "\"I think that the courts need to be somewhat deferential. In fact, I think the design is that they should be extremely deferential to these questions of political judgment made by the people's elected president of the United States,\" Vance said.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee man who killed his wife and her two teenage sons was scheduled to be executed on Thursday morning, three years after he was saved by a last-minute reprieve.",
      "Oscar Smith, 75, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection of the barbiturate pentobarbital at 10:10 a.m. Smith has always claimed to be innocent, and in an interview with The Associated Press recently, he primarily wanted to discuss the ways he felt the court system had failed him.",
      "He was convicted of fatally stabbing and shooting his estranged wife, Judith Smith, 13-year-old Jason Burnett and 16-year-old Chad Burnett at their Nashville, Tennessee, home on Oct. 1, 1989. He was sentenced to death by a Davidson County jury in July 1990 for the murders.",
      "In 2022, a Davidson County Criminal Court judge denied requests to reopen his case despite some new evidence that the DNA of an unknown person was on one of the murder weapons. The judge wrote that the evidence of Smith\u2019s guilt was overwhelming and the DNA evidence did not tip the scales in his favor.",
      "Tennessee executions have been on hold for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by the Tennessee Department of Correction.",
      "Smith came within minutes of execution in 2022 before he was saved by a surprise reprieve from Republican Gov. Bill Lee. It later turned out the lethal drugs that were going to be used on him had not been properly tested. A subsequent yearlong investigation turned up numerous other problems with Tennessee executions.",
      "The Correction Department issued new guidelines for executions in December. The new execution manual contains only a single page on the lethal injection chemicals with no specific directions for testing the drugs. It also removes the requirement that the drugs come from a licensed pharmacist. Smith\u2019s attorney, Amy Harwell, has characterized it this way: \u201cIt\u2019s as if, having been caught breaking their own rules, TDOC decided, \u2018Let\u2019s just not have rules.\u2019\u201d",
      "The new protocols are the subject of a lawsuit filed by Smith and other death row inmates. A trial in that case is set for next January.",

      "DAYTON, Ohio -- Representatives of NATO -aligned nations will gather starting Thursday in the Ohio city where an end to the three-year Bosnian War was brokered three decades ago, unpacking the lessons of the Dayton Peace Accords for navigating global conflicts.",
      "The NATO Parliamentary Assembly, a transatlantic forum of about 300 parliamentarians from the organization's 32 member nations, arrives in Dayton for their five-day meeting at a time when the Trump administration has cast doubt over whether the U.S. would defend NATO allies in Europe without them committing larger percentages of their budgets to defense spending.",
      "It is the first time since 2003 that the event has been held in the United States.",
      "Organizers are framing the 30th anniversary of the 1995 accords \u2014 negotiated at Dayton's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and signed in Paris later that year \u2014 as a celebration of peace and the power of diplomacy.",
      "The NATO Village in the heart of downtown Dayton is festooned with flags of NATO nations, and a host of cultural activities have been planned alongside formal parliamentary proceedings, including art and history exhibits and a series of free lectures open to the public. A Concert for Peace, featuring musicians from symphonies in both Dayton and Sarajevo, will be performed on May 29.",
      "\u201cThere's an excitement in the air,\u201d said Chris Kershner, president and CEO of the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, not only for our community, but for everybody who\u2019s working on it. So everybody is truly excited ... They know they're part of history happening right here.\u201d",
      "Natalie Hudson, a political science professor and executive director of the Human Rights Center at the University of Dayton, said hosting the deal that ended the horrific violence, weaponized rape and ethnic cleansing that had marked the long-running conflict between Bosnia, Serbia and to a lesser extent Croatia in the early 1990s helped shape the city's character.",
      "\u201cDayton and Daytonians were very aware at the time of what was happening at Wright-Patt Air Force Base,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were prayer vigils. Sarajevo became a sister city to Dayton, and quite a bit of a connection was made. And that idea of Dayton being a city of peace really settled in, and we take great pride in that here in the city.\u201d",
      "That spirit led to the establishment of The International Peace Museum in the city, perhaps the only museum of its kind in the U.S., she said.",
      "Hudson is among a host of speakers who will participate in \u201cThe Dayton Dialogue: Conversations about Peace and Security in the Balkans,\u201d four days of panel discussions to be held at the University of Dayton's Roger Glass Center for the Arts in tandem with the assembly.",
      "Also planned to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords is the Think Freedom project, an installation that combined art, history and community engagement. The Old Montgomery County Courthouse will host an exhibit called \u201cDayton Around the World,\u201d featuring artifacts and stories celebrating the city's history, which includes being home to the aviation-pioneering Wright brothers.",
      "Gatherings of this magnitude also require security planning. Demonstrators on many sides of the issues could show up to picket or march. The city has spent over $700,000 to rent the fencing and barricades to place around the NATO Village and summit venue downtown, which are closed to the public through Sunday.",
      "Kershner said plans are in place to ensure safety.",
      "\u201cDayton\u2019s well prepared to host events like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a great Dayton Police Department. We\u2019ve worked very closely with Ohio State Highway Patrol, with Homeland Security, with other law enforcement agencies to make sure that everybody\u2019s going to be safe, secure, and well-protected.\u201d",
      "Republican Rep. Mike Turner, head of the U.S. parliamentary delegation, represents Dayton in Congress. He is scheduled to join other dignitaries to kick off the event Thursday afternoon.",

      "The blood-stained leather gloves that were in Lincoln's pocket the night he was assassinated were among the 144 items up for bid, 136 of which sold. They were auctioned to pay off the remainder of a two-decade-old loan that the Lincoln Presidential Foundation used to buy a one-of-a-kind cluster of Lincoln artifacts from a California collector.",
      "The auction at Freeman's/Hindman in Chicago raised $7.9 million, but that includes buyers' premiums of roughly 28% tacked onto each sale to cover the auction house's administrative costs.",
      "The gloves were the top-selling items, bringing in $1.52 million including the premium. One of two handkerchiefs Lincoln had with him April 14, 1865, the night he was shot, went for $826,000.",
      "A \u201cWanted\u201d poster featuring photos of three suspects in the assassination conspiracy, led by John Wilkes Booth, sold for $762,500, far higher than the top estimated price of $120,000.",

That story came under intense scrutiny, as reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, resulting in a 2019 study that found there was no evidence the hat belonged to Lincoln.

      "WASHINGTON -- Carrying out mass deportations was a key rallying cry during Donald Trump's campaign for the presidency. Since the day he was sworn into office, his administration has focused on how to make that rallying cry reality.",
      "They've touted their policy of going after \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d \u2014 meaning people who've committed crimes in America \u2014 while leaning on some nations to take migrants who the U.S. has difficulty deporting to their own countries.",
      "They've removed protections from hundreds of thousands of people the Biden administration admitted on a temporary basis into the country with the aim of eventually making them deportable.",
      "Here's a look at the strategies that the Trump administration is using, how they're targeting people for deportation and some of the challenges they're running into:",
      "Immigration enforcement officials have repeatedly portrayed their initial efforts as going after people they describe as \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d Those are people who pose public safety or national security threats, people who've been arrested or convicted of committing crimes in America or who ICE determines are gang members.",
      "On their social media feeds, they posted a constant stream of photos of people arrested by ICE and crimes they\u2019re alleged to have committed.",
      "Previous administrations have also prioritized people who are considered public safety threats so that strategy isn't necessarily new.",

As one ICE agent described it: \u201cNobody gets a free pass anymore.\u201d",
      "Immigration enforcement officials have long complained about countries that do not take their citizens back when the U.S. has determined they can be deported.",
      "Some countries don\u2019t take back any of their citizens. Others are selective, especially when it comes to people with criminal convictions or who\u2019ve committed particularly egregious crimes. And according to a 2001 Supreme Court ruling, ICE cannot hold someone for more than six months if there is no reasonable chance to expect they can be sent back to their home country.",
      "Historically that has meant that immigration enforcement officials have had to release people into the U.S. that it wants to deport but can't.",
      "To get around this problem, the Trump administration has leaned on other countries to accept people who are not their own citizens. The most high profile of these deals was announced in February by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a trip to El Salvador. That country has taken Venezuelans that the U.S. alleges are gang members and is holding them at a notorious prison.",
      "Costa Rica and Panama have also taken citizens who are not their own although they were not imprisoned. Many of them have gone home or moved to third countries.",
      "Outside of those three Central American nations, the Trump administration has said it\u2019s exploring other third countries for deportations. More recently there's been indications the U.S. may be trying to send people to Libya or South Sudan.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to strip protections from hundreds of thousands of people admitted into the U.S. on a temporary basis during the Biden administration. This could eventually make those people subject to deportation.",
      "The Democratic president's administration admitted nearly 1.5 million people through two key programs that use a legal tool known as humanitarian parole to admit people into the country.",
      "Separately the Biden administration also dramatically expanded the number of people who were protected from deportation by Temporary Protected Status. That is a designation that allows people already living in the United States to stay and work legally for up to 18 months if their homelands are unsafe because of civil unrest or natural disasters.",
      "The Trump administration is moving aggressively to remove or terminate all of those protections. If successful \u2014 and much of these efforts are being litigated \u2014 it could potentially open up hundreds of thousands of people to be removed.",
      "There are millions of people in the country illegally including about 1.1 million with final orders of removal but only about 6,000 deportation officers. Those are the officers tasked with finding, arresting and removing people who don't have the right to be in the country.",
      "So in addition to actively trying to find and remove people, the Trump administration wants people to leave voluntarily.",
      "Through aggressive social media and television campaigns, they're encouraging people in the country illegally to go home, saying that otherwise they could face fines and never be allowed back into America.",
      "They're also offering $1,000 and air fare to people who self-deport.",

      "\u201cNo one should pretend this is going to be easy, because it\u2019s not,\" Rubio said. But if Syria could be stabilized, it would mean broader stability in the region, including Lebanon, Jordan and Israel, he said.",

      "Investigators in Tennessee say a fire that severely damaged a historic Black church that served as the headquarters for a 1968 sanitation workers\u2019 strike which brought the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Memphis was intentionally set",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A fire that severely damaged a historic Black church that served as the headquarters for a 1968 sanitation workers\u2019 strike, which brought the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Memphis, was intentionally set, investigators said Wednesday.",
      "The fire at the Clayborn Temple, which was undergoing a yearslong renovation, was set in the interior of the church, the Memphis Fire Department said in a statement. Investigators are searching for a person suspected of being involved with the blaze.",
      "Flames engulfed the downtown church in the early hours of April 28. Later that day Memphis Fire Chief Gina Sweat said the inside of the building was a total loss but there was still hope that some of the facade could be salvaged.",
      "The fire department said May 14 that the building had been stabilized and investigators would use specialized equipment to study the fire\u2019s cause.",
      "Located just south of the iconic Beale Street, the Clayborn Temple was built in 1892 as the Second Presbyterian Church and originally served an all-white congregation. In 1949 the building was sold to an African Methodist Episcopal congregation and given its current name.",
      "Before the fire it was in the midst of a $25 million restoration project that aims to preserve the architectural and historical integrity of the Romanesque revival church, including the revival of a 3,000-pipe grand organ. The project also seeks to help revitalize the neighborhood with a museum, cultural programing and community outreach.",
      "King was drawn to Memphis in 1968 to support some 1,300 predominantly Black sanitation workers who went on strike to protest inhumane treatment. Two workers had been crushed in a garbage compactor in 1964, but the faulty equipment had not been replaced.",
      "On Feb. 1 of that year, two more men, Echol Cole, 36, and Robert Walker, 30, were crushed in a garbage truck compactor. The two were contract workers, so they did not qualify for worker\u2019s compensation, and had no life insurance.",
      "Workers then went on strike seeking to unionize and fighting for higher pay and safer working conditions. City officials declared the stoppage illegal and arrested scores of strikers and protesters.",
      "The Clayborn Temple hosted nightly meetings during the strike, and the movement\u2019s iconic \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d posters were made in its basement. The temple was also a staging point for marches to City Hall, including one on March 28, 1968, that was led by King and turned violent when police and protesters clashed on Beale Street. One person was killed.",
      "When marchers retreated to the temple, police fired tear gas inside and people broke some of the stained-glass windows to escape. King promised to lead a second, peaceful march in Memphis, but he was shot by a sniper while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel on April 4.",
      "After King was assassinated and the strike ended with the workers securing a pay raise, the church\u2019s influence waned. It fell into disrepair and was vacant for years before the renovation effort, which took off in 2017 thanks to a $400,000 grant from the National Park Service.",
      "The Clayborn Temple was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. A memorial to the sanitation workers, named \u201cI AM A MAN Plaza,\u201d opened on church grounds in 2018.",
      "Anasa Troutman has been leading the restoration as executive director of Historic Clayborn Temple and founder of a nonprofit associated with the church, called The Big We. About $8 million had been spent on the renovations before the fire, and the exterior had been fully restored, Troutman said.",
      "She said in a recent interview that two chimneys had to be demolished before investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives could safely work on the property, but the church organ had been removed before the fire.",
      "As the fire was burning, she said, people went to the \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d memorial and stood at a wall where the names of the striking sanitation workers are listed.",
      "\u201cI watched that wall turn into the Wailing Wall, because people were literally getting out of their cars, walking up to that wall and wailing, staring at the building on fire,\u201d she said.",

      "Sacramento police responded at around 1:30 p.m. Monday to a report of a vehicle crash involving state Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, department spokesperson Allison Smith said. Cervantes was taken by a private party to a hospital and treated for minor injuries, Smith said.",
      "Smith said officers also went to the hospital as part of their investigation into the incident. They observed \u201cobjective signs of intoxication\u201d and issued her a citation for suspicion of DUI, she said.",
      "Cervantes, a Democrat representing part of the Inland Empire, claims no wrongdoing. She said she was seeking care in an emergency room after a car struck her vehicle. She was then \u201caccosted\u201d by Sacramento police officers, who accused her of driving under the influence and detained her for several hours, she said.",
      "Cervantes was elected to the state Senate last year after years serving in the Assembly. She previously chaired the Latino Legislative Caucus.",
      "Cervantes said \u201clab results\u201d she sought in the hospital showed she did not have alcohol in her system. Police did not conduct a breathalyzer test, Smith said.",
      "\u201cThis ordeal was deeply distressing and left me even more shaken,\" Cervantes said in a statement. \u201cAs a Senator, wife, and mother, I hold myself to the highest standard and expect others that serve our communities to do the same.\u201d",
      "The incident, which was first reported by Politico, marks the latest time in recent years in which a Democratic state lawmaker in California has been suspected of driving drunk by local authorities. U.S. Rep. Dave Min, who was a state senator at the time, and then-Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo were arrested in separate incidents in 2023 for driving under the influence. Both admitted wrongdoing.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A federal judge on Wednesday rejected arguments made by an artificial intelligence company that its chatbots are protected by the First Amendment \u2014 at least for now. The developers behind Character.AI are seeking to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the company\u2019s chatbots pushed a teenage boy to kill himself.",
      "The judge's order will allow the wrongful death lawsuit to proceed, in what legal experts say is among the latest constitutional tests of artificial intelligence.",
      "The suit was filed by a mother from Florida, Megan Garcia, who alleges that her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III fell victim to a Character.AI chatbot that pulled him into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Meetali Jain of the Tech Justice Law Project, one of the attorneys for Garcia, said the judge's order sends a message that Silicon Valley \u201cneeds to stop and think and impose guardrails before it launches products to market.\u201d",
      "The suit against Character Technologies, the company behind Character.AI, also names individual developers and Google as defendants. It has drawn the attention of legal experts and AI watchers in the U.S. and beyond, as the technology rapidly reshapes workplaces, marketplaces and relationships despite what experts warn are potentially existential risks.",
      "\u201cThe order certainly sets it up as a potential test case for some broader issues involving AI,\u201d said Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky, a law professor at the University of Florida with a focus on the First Amendment and artificial intelligence.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that in the final months of his life, Setzer became increasingly isolated from reality as he engaged in sexualized conversations with the bot, which was patterned after a fictional character from the television show \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d In his final moments, the bot told Setzer it loved him and urged the teen to \u201ccome home to me as soon as possible,\u201d according to screenshots of the exchanges. Moments after receiving the message, Setzer shot himself, according to legal filings.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Character.AI pointed to a number of safety features the company has implemented, including guardrails for children and suicide prevention resources that were announced the day the lawsuit was filed.",
      "\u201cWe care deeply about the safety of our users and our goal is to provide a space that is engaging and safe,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Attorneys for the developers want the case dismissed because they say chatbots deserve First Amendment protections, and ruling otherwise could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the AI industry.",
      "In her order Wednesday, U.S. Senior District Judge Anne Conway rejected some of the defendants' free speech claims, saying she's \u201cnot prepared\u201d to hold that the chatbots' output constitutes speech \u201cat this stage.\u201d",
      "Conway did find that Character Technologies can assert the First Amendment rights of its users, who she found have a right to receive the \u201cspeech\u201d of the chatbots. She also determined Garcia can move forward with claims that Google can be held liable for its alleged role in helping develop Character.AI. Some of the founders of the platform had previously worked on building AI at Google, and the suit says the tech giant was \u201caware of the risks\u201d of the technology.",
      "\u201cWe strongly disagree with this decision,\" said Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda. \"Google and Character AI are entirely separate, and Google did not create, design, or manage Character AI\u2019s app or any component part of it.\u201d",
      "No matter how the lawsuit plays out, Lidsky says the case is a warning of \u201cthe dangers of entrusting our emotional and mental health to AI companies.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis bill is responsive to concerns from retailers both large and small, as well as some of our constituents,\" said Democratic state Rep. Mark Gamba, who carried the bill on the House floor, adding that it would \u201chelp to create a balance in our redemption system while maintaining the program we all seek to protect.\u201d",
      "The bill passed the state House with broad bipartisan support, 48-4. It previously passed the state Senate 28-1.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Pam Marsh, who was among the four representatives to vote against the bill, had previously voiced her opposition during a committee hearing last week.",
      "Marsh said she worries the bill will undermine access to bottle and can redemption sites for people \u201cwho need to turn in cans and bottles for immediate return because they actually need those dimes and those quarters to buy dinner, to help pay rent, to take care of basic life needs.\"",
      "Consumers currently pay a 10-cent deposit on eligible beverage cans and bottles. They get that deposit back when returning them at stores or redemption centers, which can hand count containers or provide counting machines and drop-off areas. People can sign up for accounts in which their refunds are deposited or choose cash redemptions.",
      "The state\u2019s bottle drop program had over a million account holders last year, according to the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, which operates the program on behalf of its distributor members.",
      "\u201cFrom its inception, Oregon\u2019s Bottle Bill has helped protect Oregon\u2019s ocean, beaches, roadsides and special places,\u201d the cooperative said in its 2024 annual report, adding that hundreds of thousands of residents used redemptions \u201cto save for college or disability support and to save on groceries.\u201d",
      "In recent years, however, some residents and store owners, particularly in Portland, have become frustrated with redemptions and what they describe as negative impacts on their neighborhoods and business operations.",
      "Currently, stores must accept container returns when they are open, and owners of all-night convenience stores, particularly in Portland, have expressed concerns about employee safety. The bill passed by lawmakers Wednesday would allow stores to across the state to refuse container returns after 8 p.m.",
      "In Portland, the bill would allow for alternative redemption sites, including possible mobile sites such as trucks that travel to different neighborhoods. Nonprofits would run the alternative sites for people who redeem containers every day, relieving the pressure on retailers, particularly downtown.",
      "Stores in an area with an alternative drop site could limit or refuse hand-counted returns, with convenience stores specifically allowed to stop them at 6 p.m.",
      "The proposal was supported by retailers and associations whose members include \u201ccanners\u201d and waste pickers who collect containers for income.",
      "In 2023, roughly 87% of eligible containers were returned for redemption, according to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission. That was the highest rate in the nation that year, according to the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department announced Wednesday it was canceling proposed consent decrees reached with Minneapolis and Louisville to implement policing reforms in the wake of high profile police killings",
      "The Justice Department announced Wednesday it was canceling proposed consent decrees reached with Minneapolis and Louisville to implement policing reforms in the wake of the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.",
      "The department also announced it would retract its findings in six other recent sweeping investigations into police departments as part of a move to phase out the use of the federal oversight mechanism on local police departments at Republican President Donald Trump's behest.",
      "The decision to unwind the investigations is a major reversal from the Biden administration, which had aggressively used the investigations and decrees to push reforms at police departments it accused of civil rights violations.",
      "Here's more information on how consent decrees work and why they've been put in place.",
      "The federal government has used consent decrees after what are commonly referred to as pattern or practice investigations to address findings of civil rights violations or unconstitutional practices. They've been used for things like monitoring mandated desegregation in schools or addressing unconstitutional conditions in jails or prisons.",
      "The 1994 crime bill gave the Justice Department the ability to conduct pattern or practice investigations specifically of police departments.",
      "The investigations are not criminal. They are often triggered by high-profile excessive or fatal use-of-force incidents like the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville. But they can also be triggered by citizen complaints, or be started at the request of local or state officials.",
      "Consent decrees are settlements of the investigation findings that do not require admissions of guilt, but put in place a court-enforced improvement plan that requires agencies to meet specific goals before federal oversight of the agency is removed.",
      "A federal judge usually administers the consent decree and appoints a monitor to oversee and report on progress.",
      "After the Justice Department investigation is complete, and if systemic civil rights violations are found, the department's attorneys work with local governments or police agencies to negotiate the list of reforms included in the decree.",
      "Those reforms can cover an array of issues including policies, training requirements, data practices, oversight and other policing practices, said Alex del Carmen, a professor and associate dean of the School of Criminology at Tarleton State University in Fort Worth.",
      "Del Carmen, who has served as a federal monitor and a special master in large consent decrees, said the DOJ attorneys and the local government or police agency most often will agree on the terms of the decree before it is sent to a judge for approval.",
      "In the rare instance that a police department does not agree to the consent decree terms, the Justice Department has in the past filed a lawsuit to force the reforms, as it did in Colorado City, Arizona. A jury found the department had discriminated against people who weren't members of the Fundamentalist LDS Church and put in place court-ordered reforms.",
      "Most recently, Memphis declined in December to agree to the findings of a Justice Department investigation. The department had not filed a lawsuit in the case, and the announcement Wednesday retracted those findings.",
      "Consent decrees had not yet been proposed in the other five retracted investigations. The now canceled consent decrees in Louisville and Minneapolis were awaiting a judge's approval.",
      "Some decrees are designed to be completed in five years, which was the timeframe in which former President Joe Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, proposed all decrees should have a hearing to decide if they should be ended.",
      "In reality, many of the decrees last a decade or longer. The Justice Department and local officials filed a joint motion earlier this month to conclude a decree at the Albuquerque Police Department that had been enacted in November 2014. Another ongoing consent decree with the New Orleans Police Department began in 2013.",
      "After the consent decree conditions are met, departments often also have to complete a maintenance period to make sure the changes continue.",
      "\u201cConsent decrees remain in effect until a department demonstrates sustained compliance with all requirements,\u201d del Carmen said. \u201cProgress is evaluated through regular monitor reports and agency audits. If the department fails to meet benchmarks or violates the decree, the court can hold it in contempt, impose fines, extend oversight, or mandate additional corrective measures.\u201d",
      "He said in cases of continued non-compliance, a court can consider the rare step of appointing a receiver- a neutral third party- to manage the department.",
      "Critics of police department consent decrees argue they can come with expensive tabs \u2014 sometimes in the millions \u2014 including paying the monitor. Police unions and local officials often say that money could be better used making improvements to the department and paying officers.",
      "In Albuquerque critics have said they believe the decree failed, citing increased crime numbers.",
      "But advocates of the federal decrees and former monitors said those numbers \u2014 crimes or raw use-of-force numbers \u2014 are not indicative of success or failure. They point to independent monitor audits that track policy compliance, to community-trust surveys and to declines in misconduct complaints.",
      "They also say the money expended in improving training and accountability often means less payouts later in civil-liability claims against the police departments.",
      "\u201cIndependent oversight ensures that agencies cannot ignore or backslide on required changes, even amid political shifts,\u201d del Carmen said. \u201cWhile resource-intensive, it is often argued that (consent decrees) have repeatedly produced lasting reductions in misconduct and strengthened public trust in reformed departments.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency clashed with Democratic senators Wednesday, accusing one of being an \u201caspiring fiction writer\u201d and saying another does not \"care about wasting money.'' Democrats countered that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin\u2019s tenure will likely mean more Americans contracting lung cancer and other illnesses.",
      "The heated exchanges, at a Senate hearing to discuss President Donald Trump's proposal to slash the agency's budget in half, showed the sharp partisan differences over Zeldin's deregulatory approach. Zeldin, a former Republican congressman, has said his tenure will turbocharge the American economy while ensuring clean air and water. Democrats say he is endangering the lives of millions of Americans and abandoning the agency\u2019s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.",
      "Zeldin, who took office in January, has proposed a flood of changes that would sharply reduce the agency's workforce, terminate billions of dollars in grants approved by the Biden administration and roll back dozens of environmental rules including landmark regulations on climate change and pollution from coal-fired power plants.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Zeldin that a plan to cut EPA spending by 55% means that, to Zeldin and Trump, \u201cmore than half of the environmental efforts of the EPA ... to make sure Americans have clean air and clean water are just a waste.\u201d If approved by Congress, the budget cuts \u201cwill mean there\u2019s more diesel and more other particulate matter in the air\" and that \u201cwater that Americans drink is going to have more chemicals,\u201d Schiff said.",
      "\u201cYour legacy will be more lung cancer,\" he told Zeldin. \"It\u2019ll be more bladder cancer. It\u2019ll be more leukemia and pancreatic cancer ... more rare cancers of innumerable varieties.''",
      "Replied Zeldin: \u201cI understand that you are an aspiring fiction writer. I see why.\u201d",
      "Schiff said the real fiction was Zeldin's apparent belief that he can cut the EPA's budget in half \u201cand it won't affect people's health, or their water or their air.\" Schiff said the Republican administrator was \u201ctotally beholden to the oil industry,\u201d adding: \"You could give a rat's ass about how much cancer your agency causes.\"",
      "Zeldin engaged in a similar rhetorical match with Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.",
      "Whitehouse said Zeldin and others at EPA have made \u201cbaseless accusations of fraud\u201d about grants awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden, removed \u201ccareer officials who stood up for the rule of law\u201d and deployed FBI agents \"to harass career civil servants.''",
      "Whitehouse also challenged Zeldin's contention that he had personally reviewed 781 Biden-era grants totaling nearly $2 billion that the Trump administration later canceled. The grants were intended to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country, but Zeldin said they were plagued by conflicts of interest and unqualified recipients.",
      "\u201cYou don't care about wasting money, but the Trump administration does, Senator,\" Zeldin said.",
      "When Whitehouse pressed to see Zeldin's schedule to prove he personally reviewed the grants before canceling them, Zeldin said he's worked on the issue \u201calmost every single day\u201d since taking office.",
      "\"We are cracking down on every waste, every aspect of abuse,'' Zeldin said, adding that Whitehouse seemed unable to grasp that more than one person could review EPA's grant program.",
      "\"I am insisting on the facts,'' Whitehouse said.",
      "American taxpayers \u201cput President Trump in office because of people like you,\u201d Zeldin replied. \u201cThey have Republicans in charge of the House and Senate because of people like you. You don't want me to go through the list of all the evidence of waste and abuse.\"",
      "Whitehouse replied that Zeldin should explain why Justice Department lawyers, speaking under oath on behalf of the agency, have \u201csaid that everything you just said is not true. That's what I want.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for the EPA told a federal appeals court this week that the agency was \u201cnot accusing anybody of fraud\u201d in a separate dispute over its termination of $20 billion in grants under a so-called green bank program to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects nationwide.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- The U.S. Department of Energy announced Wednesday that $365 million originally slated for solar projects in Puerto Rico will be diverted to improve the island\u2019s crumbling power grid, sparking an outcry just days before the Atlantic hurricane season starts.",
      "The funds had been hanging in limbo in recent weeks, with the Department of Energy missing a recent deadline to finalize contracts worth $365 million that would see battery-operated solar systems installed at health clinics and public housing units in Puerto Rico.",
      "The money had been set aside for that purpose under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cThat money was spring loaded to flow now,\u201d said Javier R\u00faa Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Rico\u2019s Solar and Energy Storage Association.",
      "Grantees that include the nonprofit Hispanic Federation had said the funds were urgently needed to provide stable power to people including those on dialysis as major outages continue to hit Puerto Rico.",

      "Meanwhile, Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez praised the move in a statement, saying it would help all 3.2 million residents on the island instead of \u201ca few customers.\u201d",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico is facing an energy emergency that requires we act now and deliver immediate solutions. Our communities, businesses, and healthcare facilities cannot afford to wait years, nor can we rely on piecemeal approaches with limited results,\u201d she said.",

      "A spokeswoman for Josu\u00e9 Col\u00f3n, the island\u2019s so-called energy czar, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "R\u00faa Jovet noted that there are currently at least $16 billion in unspent funds from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency meant to improve Puerto Rico\u2019s electric grid, adding that the $365 million should be used for its original purpose.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing faster and better than solar batteries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should all be moving as fast as we can on generation.\u201d",

      "Many in Puerto Rico worry that any storm, regardless of how small, could knock out the grid given its fragile state.",
      "Puerto Rico already was hit with island-wide blackouts on Dec. 31 and April 16.",

      "The two private companies were contracted by the previous administration as Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority struggled to restructure more than $9 billion in public debt, with mediation still stalled.",
      "Under Biden, there was a push for more renewable energy projects in Puerto Rico, where crews are still rebuild the power grid after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm. But the grid was already weak before the storm hit given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.",

      "A federal judge in Louisiana on Wednesday struck down government regulations requiring most employers nationwide to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December 2022.",
      "The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers.",
      "Joseph, who was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \u201cit would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\u201d",
      "\"The EEOC has exceeded its statutory authority to implement the PWFA and, in doing so, both unlawfully expropriated the authority of Congress and encroached upon the sovereignty of the Plaintiff States under basic principles of federalism,\" Joseph wrote.",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women\u2019s right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.",
      "The law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "The Pregnant Workers Workers Act requires employers to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth, from time off for medical appointments to exemption for heavy-lifting, and places the burden on employers to prove \u201cundue hardships\u201d for denying any requests.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "In his ruling, Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \u201crelated medical condition\u201d of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",
      "\u201cVictory! A federal court has granted Louisiana\u2019s request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees\u2019 purely elective abortions. This is a win for Louisiana and for life!\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.",
      "A Better Balance, the workers advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling.",
      "\u201cThis court\u2019s decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women\u2019s rights and reproductive freedom,\u201d A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement.",
      "\u201cA Better Balance is working around the clock to defend this law that we fought so hard to pass. We won\u2019t stand by as these vital protections for women and all pregnant people are undermined,\u201d Chettiar added.",
      "Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.",
      "Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws.",
      "For now, Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. Trump tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum.",

      "Bustamante Leiva, a 49-year-old a native of Chile, pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud, robbery and aggravated identity theft.",
      "Video captured Bustamante Leiva taking Noem\u2019s purse while she dined at a restaurant in Washington, D.C., on April 20, investigators said. Bustamante Leiva also is charged with stealing purses from two other people at other restaurants earlier last month.",
      "Prosecutors didn't argue that Leiva poses any danger to the public. One of his attorneys, Ubong Akpan, said purse snatching is \u201cnot the most serious case that we have in the federal courts.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn't even speak to anyone or touch a complaining witness,\u201d she told the magistrate.",

      "A Secret Service agent\u2019s affidavit said Bustamante Leiva used Noem\u2019s stolen credit cards to buy over $200 in food and alcohol at a different restaurant. But the indictment says that the amount of that unauthorized charge was just over $15.",
      "The agent\u2019s affidavit doesn\u2019t name Noem, but the information in court records matches details of the theft from her. In a statement, Noem referred to the suspect as a \u201ca career criminal who has been in our country illegally for years.\u201d",
      "Authorities said there was no evidence Noem was targeted because of her position.",
      "A prosecutor, Benjamin Helfand, said Leiva has a history of skipping court dates for similar offenses, doesn\u2019t have any ties to Washington and appears to be \u201calmost transient.\u201d",
      "Akpan said Leiva has ties to New York and New Jersey. Akpan said a language barrier could explain why Leiva missed a recent court date after his arrest in a theft case in New York.",

      "During an interview on \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday, Mendez said some of the high-tech espionage depicted in the Tom Cruise action series \"Mission Impossible\" using masks that allow characters to dramatically peel off realistic facial disguises has real-world parallels.",
      "\"The idea of a mask that you could quickly put on, quickly take off was very real,\" she said. \"We used it with some discretion, but we used it when we needed it and got great results.\"",
      "Mendez said that the CIA developed masks capable of changing an agent's apparent gender and ethnicity. She said she personally demonstrated this technology to President George H.W. Bush and other high-ranking officials, including Brent Scowcroft, Bob Gates, and John Sununu \u2014 none of whom recognized her until she removed the disguise.",
      "\"No one had any idea until I took it off,\" Mendez said. She added that only Judge William H. Webster, then head of the CIA, knew about the demonstration in advance.",
      "The masks were remarkably realistic, according to Mendez.",
      "\"You would not notice unless you told a really hysterical joke and the person couldn't laugh hysterically,\" she said, noting that the disguises had some limitations, but could manage a smile.",
      "The agents could even apply these masks without mirrors in as little as 10 seconds, even \"in a parking garage without a mirror in the dark.\"",
      "When asked about the self-destructing messages depicted in the films, Mendez was more circumspect.",
      "\"I don't know that we've tried that,\" she said. \"There are many ways to convey a message. The exploding machine is only one, and I think we have not. Maybe we haven't mastered that yet.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial continues\u00a0in New York City. His ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura\u00a0wrapped up her testimony Friday after four days on the stand.",
      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "On Friday, they also heard from a special agent who photographed the hotel where Combs was arrested last year, and from Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard, who testified about seeing Combs assault Ventura.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "\"This week has been extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing for me,\" Ventura said in a statement after her testimony. \"I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear.\"",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband, trainer Alex Fine, and her brother were both seen in court for support.",
      "\"Over the past five days, the world has gotten to witness the strength and bravery of my wife freeing herself of her past,\" Fine said in a statement, going on to say, \"I did not 'save Cassie' as some have said. To say that is an insult to the years of painful work my wife has done to save herself. Cassie saved Cassie.\"",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Jurors are expected to hear from one woman who the defense says had a three-year relationship with Combs that also turned jealous and violent, as well as former employees and an assistant.",
      "Combs has denied all of the allegations through his lawyers, who described the women as \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "Other high-profile names in the Sean Combs case",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all. Ventura testified about dating Jordan, as well as Kid Cudi.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",
      "Combs' defense team is led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who along with his wife Karen Friedman Agnifilo is also defending\u00a0Luigi Mangione\u00a0in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 12:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The \"Make America Healthy Again\" report outlines what it says are four leading drivers of childhood disease, but it is facing criticism from some health officials.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's \"Make America Healthy Again\" or \"MAHA\" commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has published its first report on what it says are four leading drivers of childhood chronic disease.",
      "\"The report is the product of a consensual process, and it represents a collaborative effort of all the agencies and the White House. And it represents a consensus that is probably the strongest and most radical consensus by a government agency in history about the state of America's health,\" Kennedy told reporters in a call ahead of its release.",
      "Thursday's release is the first in a process laid out by President Trump's executive order in February. By August, the commission is due to follow up with a policy strategy to address the findings raised in this report.",
      "The \"chronic disease crisis\" in children is described in the report as growing rates of a number of issues including childhood obesity, diabetes, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, cancer, allergies and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that the Trump administration was not seeking \"a European, mandate-driven regulatory system that stifles growth\" as a result of the process.",
      "\"It will happen through a renewed focus on improved science throughout the federal government and our partners. And through unleashing private sector innovation to produce better solutions for our children,\" Zeldin said.",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials criticized the report, which they said misrepresented several facts and left out other well-known drivers of childhood chronic disease.",
      "\"They're looking for specific causes and silver bullets to draw attention to. However, prevention is all about making it easier for people to make healthy choices,\" said one current federal health official in a message, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "What does the MAHA report say is causing childhood chronic disease?",
      "The wide-ranging report is organized around four topics that it describes as the \"potential drivers behind the rise in childhood chronic disease that present the clearest opportunities for progress\":",
      "Poor diet, driven primarily by ultra-processed foods",
      "Cumulative exposure to chemicals like food additives and pesticides",
      "Lack of physical activity and chronic stress",
      "\"Overmedicalization\" with too many prescriptions and vaccines",
      "These largely reflect many of the themes that Kennedy has long spoken about, including as a longshot presidential candidate last year and as the head of the nation's public health agencies in recent months.",
      "\"It is very strong, it's very frank, and it is a clarion call to do something with utmost urgency to end this crisis. And that's what we wanted,\" Kennedy said of the report.",
      "For example, under the heading of ultra-processed foods, the report echoes Kennedy's criticism of the shift from using \"minimally processed animal-based sources like butter and lard\" to seed oils like corn and canola. And it takes aim at the federal dietary guidelines process, which is due to release a major update later this year.",
      "Others reflect past Kennedy priorities that stop short of his previous calls. For example, the report criticizes the \"corporate capture of media\" through advertising campaigns paid for by drugmakers, but does not call for a ban as he did in the past, acknowledging the pharmaceutical industry \"has the First Amendment right to have these\" ads.",
      "Some parts of the report mirror public health advice championed under the Biden administration, like around the \"epidemic of loneliness and isolation,\" which then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned in 2023 was driven by factors like social media and technology.",
      "It also often points to other countries as examples of how things could be done better. A section criticizing U.S. school nutrition programs cites examples from France, Japan and Nordic countries that prepare meals using healthier ingredients.",
      "What does the MAHA report say about pesticides?",
      "The report warns that no \"country in the world has fully accounted for the fact that children are often exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals,\" saying that evaluations of chemicals individually may be neglecting the \"cumulative burdens\" of multiple exposures.",
      "Pesticides are named as a potential risk to be studied alongside a list that includes PFAS, microplastics, fluoride, electromagnetic radiation and chemicals used to make plastics.",
      "\"For example, a selection of research studies on a herbicide (glyphosate) have noted a range of possible health effects, ranging from reproductive and developmental disorders as well as cancers, liver inflammation and metabolic disturbances,\" the report says.",
      "Kennedy has previously spoken out vocally against glyphosate, dating back to court battles with the manufacturer of the Roundup pesticide made from the chemical. That had worried some Republicans and the agriculture industry ahead of the report's release.",
      "The report says that an updated government assessment of common herbicides will be released in 2026 and criticizes pesticide manufacturers for having \"spent billions on research initiatives\" that may have biased studies on the topic.",
      "But the report also pledges to support U.S. farmers, acknowledging that \"precipitous changes in agriculture practices could have an adverse impact\" on the food supply and says that past federal reviews of herbicides \"did not establish a direct link\" to bad health outcomes.",
      "\"We know that the American food system is the safest in the world. It is the safest, most reliable, most robust in the world. But now we talk about how to make it even better and healthier,\" said Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.",
      "What does the MAHA report say about vaccines and medications?",
      "The report lists a number of medications that it says raise \"important questions\" about its long-term impact for use on children. The list includes antidepressants, stimulant medications for ADHD, weight loss drugs, antibiotics and acid suppressants.",
      "\"Increasingly common, these popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs with complicated metabolic effects lack neurodevelopmental and other long term safety data, raising the specter of unforeseen problems that interrupt, damage, or impair metabolism and growth development,\" the report says of GLP-1 agonist medications.",
      "It calls out the \"growth of the childhood vaccine schedule,\" which Kennedy has long denounced, often with misleading claims about how vaccines were not sufficiently vetted for safety and efficacy.",
      "\"The number of vaccinations on the American vaccine schedule exceeds the number of vaccinations on many European schedules, including Denmark, which has nearly half as many,\" the report says.",
      "The report also reiterates Kennedy's criticism of the CDC's vaccine safety monitoring efforts, like in the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System and Vaccine Safety Datalink, as well as the federal approach to compensating childhood vaccine injury.",
      "It also criticizes groups like the American Medical Association for efforts to address disinformation about vaccines, saying it \"undermines the open dialogue essential to protecting and improving children's health.\"",
      "Kennedy's approach to vaccines has put him at odds with groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, which has urged him to do more to foster confidence in the \"rigorous safety system\" for vaccines needed to protect children.",
      "\"FDA and the CDC work together to ensure that years of vaccine clinical trials and safety studies are exhaustively examined, with rigorous, respected, and accepted scientific evidence,\" the group said in a letter in March.",
      "What does the MAHA report get wrong?",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials raised a number of issues with the report, which they said misstated several facts and left out several already well-documented drivers known to be causing chronic disease in children that health authorities are already working to address.",
      "Those efforts, they warned, such as work to avert lead poisoning in children, are now under-resourced in the wake of massive layoffs and further proposed budget cuts.",
      "\"This document makes it seem like we don't know what makes people sick,\" one federal health official said in a message, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Two officials pointed out maternal health and preterm birth was left out of the report, which is known to lead to a number of health problems and can be prevented through steps like quitting smoking, avoiding alcohol and getting early prenatal care. Smoking, and the need for broader efforts to prevent youth use of nicotine products, was also not mentioned in the report.",
      "Multiple officials said that scientific research and federal data had been selectively misrepresented in the report.",
      "One official pointed out that what the report highlights as a dramatic rise in childhood cancer ignores improvements in early diagnosis driving the higher rates, as well as declines in deaths.",
      "Another section of the report criticizes the federal dietary guidelines for focusing on limiting sodium instead of focusing on minimizing ultra-processed foods, which a former top FDA official said was \"very puzzling.\"",
      "\"Reducing sodium in the diet is likely the most impactful step they could take to reduce chronic disease risk, and they ignore the totality of the science, including large randomized trials of salt interventions and salt substitutes, that demonstrate important reductions in chronic diseases,\" Dr. Susan Mayne, the FDA's former top nutrition official, said in an email.",

    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is telling Pfizer and Moderna to expand the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines about the risk of a possible heart injury side effect linked to the mRNA shots, primarily in teen boys and young men, citing findings from a study published last year and new agency data.",
      "Orders to expand the warnings were posted Wednesday by the FDA, in letters dated April 17 to Pfizer and BioNTech about their Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna about its Spikevax vaccine.",
      "Both vaccines previously carried warnings about how the risk of the heart side effects \u2014 which doctors call myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) \u2014 looked to be higher in young men, generally within the first week after vaccination. While the earlier labels specified ages 18 to 24 years old for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 years old for Pfizer's, the new warning will apply to males ages 16 to 25 for both vaccines.",
      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "CDC officials told the agency's vaccine advisers last month that acute myocarditis \"tends to resolve quickly\" after vaccination, and no increased risk had been seen in data from recent seasons in people 12 to 39 years old.",
      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Moderna and Pfizer should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",

      "The Food and Drug Administration says it has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.",
      "\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you're under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it's very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"",
      "While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she's skeptical.",
      "\"There's a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",
      "Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.",
      "\"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death,\" Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said in a statement.",
      "Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said they \"appreciate the FDA's clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.\"",
      "A Novavax spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax earned a narrow FDA approval over the weekend for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was limited to seniors as well as adults and adolescents with at least one underlying condition.",
      "While U.S. health care providers are usually allowed to administer vaccines with FDA approval \"off-label\" outside the limits laid out by the agency, a narrower approval can affect access and limit insurance coverage for the vaccinations.",
      "It comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also been weighing narrowed recommendations for the shots.",
      "The CDC's recommendations directly impact which vaccinations health insurers are required to cover under the law.",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

      "Rappaport was admitted to Abbott Northwestern in March 2022 and was scheduled for a spleen removal surgery, the lawsuit says. After the doctor recommended the surgery, the suit says he reviewed the risk of procedure with her.",
      "The lawsuit says that the doctor performed an open laparotomy procedure, during which Rappaport's \"left kidney was removed instead of her spleen.\" In a post-operative note, the doctor said he removed an intact spleen during the surgery, but a post-operative CT scan showed her left kidney had been removed, and the spleen tissue was still present, the lawsuit says.",
      "Before the surgery, a CT scan showed that Rappaport's kidneys were \"unremarkable. No suspicious masses, stones, or hydronephrosis,\" according to the lawsuit. Rappaport did not consent to the removal of her left kidney, documents state.",
      "She stayed in the hospital until May 25, 2022 due to complications following the removal of the kidney, the suit says. She also now requires continued treatment, including dialysis, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit claims the doctor committed medical malpractice and medical battery. The lawsuit accuses him of breaching his duty of care he owed Rappaport and causing permanent, irreversible injury. The Allina health system also faces similar allegations, as the medical professionals involved in the surgery also owed her a duty of care, documents say.",
      "Rappaport is seeking at least $50,000 in the case.",

While we will not discuss details of a patient's care due to privacy laws, the court filings don't accurately reflect the full picture of the patient's condition or the life-saving medical care provided. We intend to vigorously defend, in court, the care that was provided,\" Allina Health said in a statement.",

The Defendants were supposed to remove a \"sick\" spleen but removed the incorrect organ. As a result, Ms. Rappaport suffers not only the loss of her left kidney but also permanent kidney impairment, and she requires specific medical treatment to maintain her ongoing kidney function. This was not the case for Ms. Rappaport prior to the unnecessary kidney removal. On 5/16/2025, we commenced the lawsuit on Ms. Rappaport's behalf seeking fair compensation for her injuries and the future damages she will incur due to the Defendant's medical malpractice and medical battery.

      "While the researchers were asked to continue working for a few more weeks in the labs they run at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, multiple sources familiar with the situation say their layoff notices have not been revoked.",
      "\"Most people believe we were reinstated because we got back to the office,\" one of the scientists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News in a message.",
      "This means they still face termination from the federal government on June 2, alongside the thousands of other workers who were put on leave after Kennedy's layoffs were announced last month.",
      "\"These 11 labs have about 100 staff, mainly young trainees whose careers will be severely disrupted,\" one scientist familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "News of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke scientists losing their jobs was previously reported by The Transmitter.",
      "The laid-off scientists include Richard Youle. Youle, who has served at the NIH since 1978, carries the title of distinguished investigator, a designation reserved for the agency's most preeminent researchers. He was the winner\u00a0of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2021 for his research into Parkinson's disease.",
      "A scientist familiar with Youle's work, who spoke anonymously fearing retaliation, praised his research as a \"fundamentally important\" breakthrough for the field. Youle's results had paved the way for researchers to find new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, the NIH said in its news release.",
      "One source at the NIH said Youle had received four job offers after news of the layoffs broke last month. Three were for positions outside the United States. While Youle has told others that he has no interest in leaving the U.S. for now, the source said it shows that \"the world is ready to pounce and take our top scientists if we don't fix this.\"",
      "Ten other senior investigators \u2013 Miguel Holmgren, Steve Jacobson, Dorian McGavern, Joseph Mindell, Katherine Roche, Zu-Hang Sheng, David R. Sibley, Kenton Swartz, Susan Wray and Ling-Gang Wu \u2013 were also laid off at NINDS, according to records shared with CBS News. A senior associate scientist at NINDS, Silvina Horowitz, got a layoff notice as well, the records show.",
      "Among the scientists who have received major recognition for their work in recent years include Wu, who was selected for a prestigious award in February from the Biophysical Society for his ongoing research on how neurons communicate and function. Sibley was recognized in 2023 by a pharmacology society for \"seminal contributions\" to understanding dopamine receptors in the brain.",
      "Kennedy had told a Senate health committee at a\u00a0hearing on May 14 that the only cuts they had made to date were \"administrative cuts.\"",
      "\"As far as I know, we have not fired any working scientists, the working scientists, the people who are actually doing science. There are some people who were scientists that were doing IT or administration, who did lose their jobs. But in terms of working scientists, our policy was to make sure none of them were lost and that that research continues,\" Kennedy said.",
      "NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and senior leaders within the department were made aware weeks ago about the layoffs, multiple sources told CBS News. Bhattacharya and others previously said that they were mistakes and would be reversed soon.",
      "Weeks have passed since those assurances were made to the scientists. Multiple sources said the scientists have yet to receive any letters revoking their \"reduction in force\" or \"RIF\" notices, or an explanation for why moves to reverse their layoffs never occurred.",
      "That is unlike similar layoffs that were revoked weeks ago at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the department, which officials completed in the days ahead of Kennedy's testimony to Capitol Hill.",
      "When asked about the employment status of NIH and NIOSH scientists who received reduction in forces notices, a spokesperson for the department pointed back to Kennedy's remarks at the Senate hearing about the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy's claim that no working scientists were fired has drawn disdain in recent days from other laid-off scientists at multiple health agencies beyond the NIH.",
      "For example, while some of the laid-off employees at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were restored ahead of Kennedy's hearing, researchers in the agency's Health Effects Laboratory Division remain off the job. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also lost many scientists in its National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for an array of work ranging from lead poisonings to illness outbreaks on cruise ships. CDC labs investigating outbreaks of viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases were also eliminated, after all the scientists were laid off.",
      "\"Perhaps he is unaware that his RIFs have gutted scientists and front-line public health workers at CDC, the very people he vowed to protect,\" one laid-off CDC official told CBS News.",
      "Some within the NIH said they believed that the scientists would be reinstated after the research agency faced a second round of layoffs, which employees had been told were to compensate for scientists that needed to be reinstated to their positions.",
      "Around 200 employees at the NIH were laid off, including staff at the National Cancer Institute and Office of Research Facilities. Officials said the cuts wiped out multiple teams responsible for contracting work to conduct emergency maintenance around the NIH's campuses and oversee laboratory safety.",

      "Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen's departure comes a week after the company downgraded its sales and profits forecast, and follows a more than 50% decline in the company's shares since mid-2024.",
      "The company said May 7 that Wegovy sales in the U.S. had been undercut by cheaper replica drugs produced by so-called compounding pharmacies using active ingredients of patented drugs. They are relied on as substitutes when name-brand drugs aren't available. The Food and Drug Administration, however, has said however that shortages have eased and the replicas will have to cease in the coming months.",
      "On Sunday, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that people lost more weight using Wegovy competitor Zepbound, made by pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Eli Lilly funded the study. Novo Nordisk's share price is down 54% from its peak in June 2024. Its U.S.-listed shares fell another 3% in premarket trading Friday.",
      "The company, headquartered in Bagsvaerd, Denmark, praised Jorgensen has having led Novo Nordisk through a \"significant growth journey and transformation\" during his eight-year tenure as CEO.",
      "\"The changes are, however, made in light of the recent market challenges Novo Nordisk has been facing, and the development of the company's share price since mid-2024,\" the company said in a statement. The board and Jorgensen \"have jointly concluded that initiating a CEO succession is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.\"",

    "summary": "Seniors are unlikely to get a break on paying taxes on their Social Security benefits, an issue that impacts more people each year.",
    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation approved Thursday morning by House lawmakers includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in President Trump's domestic policy bill that passed early Thursday following a dramatic all-night session.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition. The proposed legislation, which spans more than 1,000 pages and includes a 42-page amendment with last-minute changes, would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "\"Enhanced deduction for seniors\"",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "But the new deduction for seniors is a limited-time break: It would be effective starting in the current 2025 tax year, but expire starting in the 2029 tax year, according to the legislation.",
      "The tax break also has an income threshold, with the full $4,000 deduction available to single filers who earn $75,000 or less and for married couples with annual incomes below $150,000. The deduction would be phased out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

    "summary": "Federal judge strikes down government regulations requiring most U.S. employers to accommodate workers for abortions.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December 2022.",
      "The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers.",
      "Joseph, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \"It would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\"",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of a rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",
      "Bipartisan support for pregnant workers law",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women's right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.",
      "The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \"related medical condition\" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",
      "\"Victory! A federal court has granted Louisiana's request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees' purely elective abortions. This is a win for Louisiana and for life!\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.",
      "A Better Balance, the advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling.",
      "\"This court's decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,\" A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement.",
      "EEOC adrift",
      "Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.",
      "President Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. The president tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who voted against the regulations because of the abortion provision, has said she will work to change them.",
      "Similar lawsuits challenging the abortion provision are underway, including one filed by 17 states, led by Tennessee and Arkansas. In February, an appeals court ruled that lawsuit could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department had defended the EEOC against those lawsuits but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so under the Trump administration. The Justice Department did not reply to request for comment on Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Chettiar said the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the ruling, adding to its significance.",
      "\"The impact of this is huge,\" Chettiar said in an interview with The Associated Press, calling the decision \"symbolic and a big signal of where the right is when it comes to the rights of women.\"",
      "However, the Trump administration has continued defend the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act itself in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas that seeks to overturn the law in its entirety.",

      "Stocks are slumping amid signs of slowing consumer spending and investor concerns about the U.S. fiscal outlook.",
      "Target, one of the nation's largest retailers, on Wednesday reported weaker sales for the first quarter and warned of a potential downdraft over the rest of the year as Americans react to U.S. tariffs by pulling back on consumption.",
      "The company's sales fell 2.8% to $23.8 billion in the January-March period, down from $24.5 billion from the year-ago quarter, while Target said it expects a low-single digit decline in sales for 2025.",
      "Target \"faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence [and] uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs,\" CEO Brian Cornell said in a call with Wall Street analysts.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 96 points, or 1.5%, to close at 5,845. The Dow Jones Industrial Complex dropped 817 points, or 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4%.",
      "Target shares fell $5.11 on the day, or 5.2% to $93.01.",
      "Such weakness comes as more companies say that rising economic uncertainty is clouding their financial prospects. Other large retailers, including Walmart, have said they plan to hike prices to offset tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on China and other countries.",
      "\"We continue to feel there's too much complacency about two key (and related) sources of macro risk: tariffs and fiscal policy,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a note to investors. \"Despite a de-escalation of trade tensions, tariffs are still quite elevated on an absolute basis, and the full effects of these import taxes haven't been felt yet in the economy.\"",
      "Shrinking corporate sales and profits could eventually shackle job growth, which has remained resilient in recent months, experts note.",
      "\"Businesses expect growth in consumer demand to slow and view the outlook as unusually uncertain, so they are pausing hiring,\" analysts with Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Some retailers are benefiting from the current environment as some consumers tighten their belts. Discount giant TJX Companies, whose brands include HomeGoods, Marshall's and TJ Maxx, on Wednesday reported a 5% rise in net sales for its fiscal 2026 first quarter from a year ago.",
      "Tax bill overhang",
      "Investors are also assessing how a Republican-backed tax and spending bill\u00a0now being negotiated in the House could impact the nation's finances. Moody's on Friday highlighted the government's growing debt pile in its decision to\u00a0downgrade the U.S. credit rating. A weaker credit rating raises borrowing costs for the U.S.",
      "\"We do not think that the downgrade matters by itself,\" Bank of America strategists wrote in a report, \"but it has served as a wake up call for those investors who had been ignoring the ongoing fiscal discussion.\"",
      "Stocks were also feeling pressure from higher Treasury yields in the bond market, which can weigh on other types of investments. Bond prices have dipped because of concerns that a move in Congress to extend tax cuts could add trillions to the federal debt.",
      "\"The bulk of the bill simply extends existing [tax] rates rather than lowering them incrementally,\" Crisafulli said. \"In addition, there are some offsets that could financially harm lower-income Americans. Most important, the legislation is massively expensive and will add further to the debt/deficit at a time when both are already extremely unbalanced.\"",

      "\"What all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Pichai told the crowd yesterday at an amphitheater near the company's \u00a0headquarters in Mountain View, California, according to the Associated Press.",
      "A\u00a0video teasing the technology showcases how it works. In response to lengthy, detailed questions typed into Google search, AI Mode displays how many searches Google is performing and how many sites it's scanning as the technology quickly generates a summarized response at the top of the search platform. It also provides a side bar with links to relevant sites.",
      "Google said it's also testing a \"Search Live\" feature that will enable the search engine to respond to questions based on video content, as well as voice searches, or to questions verbalized by the user, rather than typed.",
      "As an example, Google's\u00a0teaser\u00a0shows a person recording a video of themselves holding a bridge made of Popsicle sticks while asking the search engine what can be done to strengthen the structure. \"To make it stronger, consider adding more triangles to the design,\" an automated voice responds.",

      "Some argue that AI Overviews, which provides an AI-generated summary of information online, at times eliminating the need to click directly on source links for further information, has undercut traffic to their sites. According to a\u00a0study by Ahrefs, AI Overviews led to a 35% lower average click-through rates for top-ranking pages on search engine results pages.",
      "Concerns over accuracy",
      "\"By making AI Mode a core part of the experience, Google is betting it can cater to the demand for AI without alienating its massive base,\" Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst for research firm eMarketer, wrote in a blog\u00a0post. \"But there are risks for hallucinations and factual errors which could drive users towards competitors,\" he added.",
      "Such factual errors were spotted with AI Overviews soon after its release, prompting Google to admit in a statement at the time that the technology produced \"some odd and erroneous overviews.\" In one instance, AI Overviews suggested that users add glue to pizza or eat at least one small rock a day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the MIT Technology Review.",
      "As for AI Mode, Google has indicated that its new AI search tech is performing well and serving its intended purpose.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 07:14:07 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Department of Education this month resuming collections on student loans, millions of Americans are at risk of having their wages garnished.",
    "story": [
      "Americans with student loans who are behind on their payments could face having their wages garnished and other serious financial consequences now that the Trump administration restarted collections\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Repayments on student debt had been paused for five years since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the U.S. economy and caused unemployment to soar. Nearly 43 million borrowers owe a total of more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the Department of Education.",
      "Of that number, more than 5 million are in default on their loans, meaning they haven't made a monthly payment in more than 360 days, the agency says. An additional 4 million borrowers are in late-stage delinquency, having not made a payment in at least 91 days. The DOE expects that 10 million, or 25% of student borrowers, could be in default on their loans in a matter of months.",
      "In the first three months of the year, the delinquency rate for student loans jumped from less than 1% to nearly 8%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Older Americans are in worse shape when it comes to repaying student debt than younger borrowers. Although Americans over 50 years of age make up just 20% of those with outstanding college loans, they account for 33% of delinquencies, according to Oxford Economics which notes that younger borrowers are in relatively better shape.",
      "Student loans differ from other types of consumer debt in that there is no statute of limitations on collections, meaning the government can pursue punitive actions for defaulted loans indefinitely, noted Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "\"It's so much worse than just about any other financial product,\" Yu told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's a really small universe of things that have these harsh penalties.\"",
      "And because collections were paused for five years due to the pandemic, some student loan borrowers may have forgotten about the severe financial consequences of defaulting. \"It's left the collective consciousness,\" she said.",
      "Here's what to know about the potential repercussions of defaulting on student debt, including when your wages can be garnished.",
      "When can a lender garnish your wages?",
      "The Trump administration announced\u00a0on April 21 that the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) would resume collections on defaulted federal student loans starting May 5. The DOE said at the time that it would email notices to borrowers in default over the following two weeks to make \"them aware of these developments.\"",
      "Notices from the FSA informing borrowers that their wages could be garnished will come \"later this summer,\" the DOE said.",
      "Under the law, a lender can garnish borrowers' pay without going to court provided it has given them at least 60 days notice, generally by email, before initiating the collection action.",
      "\"All they have to do is send borrowers a notice that they are going to take your money, and you have 60 days to respond,\" Yu said.",
      "Given that collections on student loans resumed earlier this month, people could begin to see their wages garnished in the fall, according to experts.",
      "The government notice informs people how to start making payments, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation to avoid having a portion of their paychecks seized. It doesn't, however, instruct borrowers how they can stop wage garnishment.",
      "\"The notices the Trump administration is sending out do not lay out defenses and don't lay out the right to appeal wage garnishment on basis of financial hardship, and that's really important for borrowers to understand,\" Yu said.",
      "How much can be withheld from your paycheck?",
      "A lender may garnish up to 15% of your disposable pay, but must leave borrowers with the equivalent of 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25, or $217.50 per week. That applies even if a borrower resides in a state where the minimum wage is higher than the federal level.",
      "Can other assets be garnished?",
      "Yes. In addition to wages, the federal government may also seize tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits when loans are in default.",
      "If you've already filed your taxes and received a refund, it's protected, Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But you'd be on notice if you asked for an extension,\" she explained.",
      "The government or a lender would likely have to take a borrower to court in order to target other assets.",
      "\"That would entail getting a judgment and doing some kind of court intervention, and those are relatively rare,\" Nierman said.",
      "How can you get out of default?",
      "Beyond possibly leading to wage garnishment, defaulting on a student loan hurts in other ways. It damages your credit, which raises borrowing costs or limits access to credit like mortgages and car loans.",
      "In some cases, student loan borrowers have the right to contest their default status. First, the debt might not be their own. Second, they might not owe the amount of debt the government claims they do. Third, they can claim that wage garnishment would cause them financial hardship.",
      "\"There are legitimate reasons why they can stop wage garnishment from occurring,\" Yu said. \"But I am very worried these notices aren't telling people about the full scope of the relief.\"",
      "Borrowers can also get current on their loans through other methods. For example, consider requesting loan rehabilitation to get out of default by making nine on-time payments in full over a 10-month period.",
      "You can also avoid entering default and having wages garnished through loan consolidation. Essentially, this process replaces your old debt with a new loan that's in good standing and on which you can start making payments. If you're able to repay your loans in full, that's another way to exit default.",

Such growth could have a significant impact on both the reliability and affordability of electricity, the report said. Retail costs are also expected to rise; by 2050, costs passed onto the consumer could double, ICF found.",
      "\"This is a pivotal moment as rising demand creates urgent challenges for the grid,\" said Anne Choate, ICF executive vice president for energy, environment and infrastructure in a statement.",
      "The U.S. could struggle with increased electricity demand due to rising temperatures and the growing use of emerging technologies, bearing down on an overloaded system. The report found that in Texas, nearly one-third of the expected increase is attributable to large load sources, such as cryptocurrency mining operations.

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 20:19:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Late last year, South Carolina Medicaid approved GLP-1s to treat obesity, placing it among the few state programs covering the drugs. But access remains limited.",
    "story": [
      "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Page Campbell's doctor recommended that she try an injectable prescription drug called Wegovy to lose weight before scheduling bariatric surgery, she readily agreed.",
      "\"I've struggled with my weight for so long,\" said Campbell, 40, a single mother of two. \"I'm not opposed to trying anything.\"",
      "In early April, about four weeks after she'd started taking Wegovy, Campbell said she hadn't experienced any side effects, such as nausea or bowel irritation. But she doesn't use a scale at home, so she said she didn't know whether she'd lost any weight since her most recent medical appointment earlier this year, when she weighed 314 pounds. Still, she was confident about achieving weight loss.",
      "\"It's going to work because I'm putting in the work. I'm changing my eating habits. I'm exercising,\" said Campbell, a shipping manager at a Michaels store. \"I'm not going to second-guess myself.\"",
      "Wegovy belongs to a pricey class of drugs called GLP-1s (short for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists) that have upended the treatment of obesity in recent years, offering hope to patients who have tried and failed to lose weight in myriad other ways.",
      "Campbell gained access to Wegovy through South Carolina Medicaid's decision in late 2024 to cover these weight loss drugs. But the medications remain out of reach for millions of patients across the country who could benefit from them, because many public and private health insurers have deemed the drugs too expensive.",
      "A report published in November by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, found only 13 states were covering GLP-1s for the treatment of obesity for Medicaid beneficiaries as of August 2024. South Carolina became the 14th in November.",
      "Liz Williams, one of the report's authors and a senior policy manager for the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, said she was not aware of any other state Medicaid programs joining the list since then. Looking ahead, the remaining states may be reluctant to add a new, expensive drug benefit while they brace for potential federal cuts coming from Congress, she said.",
      "\"As the budget debate, federally, is developing, that may impact how states are thinking about this,\" Williams said.",
      "The federal government won't be helping anytime soon, either. Medicare covers GLP-1s to treat diabetes and some other health conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but not obesity. In early April, the Trump administration announced it will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is poised to force less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs off the market.",
      "And the barrier to entry remains high, even for Medicaid patients in those few states that have agreed to cover the drugs without a federal mandate.",
      "Case in point: In South Carolina, where more than one-third of all adults, and nearly half of the African American population, qualify as obese, the state Medicaid agency estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the stringent prerequisites for GLP-1 coverage.",
      "Under one of those requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to access these drugs to lose weight must attest to \"increased exercise activity,\" said Jeff Leieritz, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Campbell, who is insured by Medicaid, was granted coverage for Wegovy based on her body mass index. First, though, she was required to submit six months' worth of documentation proving that she'd tried and failed to lose weight after receiving nutrition counseling and going on a 1,200-calorie-a day diet, said Kenneth Mitchell, one of Campbell's doctors and the medical director for bariatric surgery and obesity medicine at Roper St. Francis Healthcare.",
      "Campbell's Wegovy prescription was approved for six months, Mitchell said. When that authorization expires, Campbell and her health care team will need to submit more documentation, including proof that she has lost at least 5% of her body weight and has kept up with nutrition counseling.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Send a prescription in and they cover it.' It's rather arduous,\" Mitchell said. \"Not a lot of folks are going to do this.\"",
      "Mitchell said South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover these drugs was met with excitement among those working in his medical specialty. But he wasn't surprised that the state anticipates relatively few people will access this benefit annually, since the approval process is so rigorous and the cost high. \"The problem is the medicines are so expensive,\" Mitchell said.",
      "Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Wegovy, announced in March that it was cutting the monthly price for the drug from $650 to $499 for cash-paying customers. The price that health insurance plans and beneficiaries pay for these drugs varies, but some GLP-1s cost more than $1,000 per patient per month, Mitchell said, and many people will need to take them for the rest of their lives to maintain weight loss.",
      "\"That is a tremendous price tag that someone has to foot the bill for,\" Mitchell said.",
      "That's the reason the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees voted last year to end coverage of GLP-1s for state employees, after then-North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell's office estimated in 2023 that the drugs were projected to cost the State Health Plan $1 billion over the next six years. The decision came only a few months after a separate North Carolina agency announced it would start covering these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. North Carolina Medicaid has estimated it will spend $16 million a year on GLP-1s.",
      "South Carolina Medicaid, which insures fewer than half the number of people enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid, anticipates spending less. Leieritz estimated GLP-1s and nutrition counseling offered to Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina will cost $10 million a year. State funding will cover $3.3 million of the expense; the remainder will be paid for by matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "In a recent interview, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.",
      "They're \"extraordinary drugs\" and \"we're going to reduce the cost,\" Kennedy told CBS News in early April. He said he would like GLP-1s to eventually be made available to Medicare and Medicaid patients who are seeking obesity treatment after they have tried other ways to lose weight. \"That is the framework that we're now debating.\"",
      "Meanwhile, public health experts have applauded South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s. Yet the new benefit won't help the vast majority of the 1.5 million adults in South Carolina who are classified as obese, according to data published by the South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "\"We still have some work to do,\" acknowledged Brannon Traxler, the public health department's chief medical officer.",
      "But the state's new \"Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living,\" written by a coalition of groups in South Carolina, including the Department of Public Health, makes no mention of GLP-1s or the role they might play in lowering obesity rates in the state.",
      "The action plan, underwritten by a $1.5 million federal grant, isn't meant to lay out an overarching approach for lowering obesity in South Carolina, Traxler said. Instead, it promotes physical activity in schools, nutrition, and the expansion of outdoor walking trails, among other strategies. A more comprehensive obesity plan might address the benefits of surgical intervention and GLP-1s, but those also carry risk, expense, and side effects, Traxler said.",
      "\"Certainly, I think, there is a need to bring it all together,\" she said.",
      "Campbell, for one, is taking the comprehensive approach. On top of injecting Wegovy once weekly, she said, she is prioritizing protein intake and moving her body. She also underwent weight loss surgery in late April.",
      "\"Weight loss is my biggest goal,\" said Campbell, who expressed appreciation for Medicaid's coverage of Wegovy. \"It's one more thing that's going to help me get to my goal.\"",

      "What is the $TRUMP meme coin \u2014 and why is it controversial?",
      "The meme coin was launched in January, days before Mr. Trump's inauguration. An affiliate of the Trump organization and a firm called Fight Fight Fight LLC control 80% of the coin's total supply.",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is driven mostly by online buzz, especially on social media. They typically do not have intrinsic value and are not used for transactions.

      "But late last month, the price surged after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced. Buyers spent more than $140 million to buy the $TRUMP coins in hopes of securing an invitation to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Mr. Trump previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" The president and his two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and crypto makes up some $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth according to a recent report.",

      "The $TRUMP private dinner marketing promotion \u2014 and the president's links to World Liberty \u2014 have raised concerns among government watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest.",
      "The Senate on Monday advanced a bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, that would regulate so-called stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. The bill faced some pushback from Democrats who pushed for anti-corruption rules, often citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings.",

      "\"The President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public \u2013 which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement Tuesday.",

    "summary": "High temperatures and rising electricity costs could boost home energy bills by 6% this summer, a new report says.",
    "story": [
      "High temperatures projected across the U.S. summer could take a toll on Americans' budgets by driving up the price of keeping homes cool.",
      "Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, up more than 6% from $737 in 2024 and marking a 12-year record, according a new analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "The growing expense comes on the heels of a cold winter that drove up heating costs for many Americans, and as consumers continue to grapple with higher prices on everyday goods. Consumers are also increasingly expressing concerns about how tariffs\u00a0could affect their day-to-day costs, Gallup polling has found.",
      "\"We found that it's going to be another expensive summer for air conditioning because temperatures will stay high, and electricity prices have been rising faster than inflation,\" energy economist Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures, NEADA said. Those trends mean that households are not only expected to pay higher prices for electricity, but will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling.",
      "\"It's not just temperatures that are going up, but the cost of cooling is going up,\" Wolfe said. \"And when electricity prices go up, they tend to stay high. So even if temperatures moderate, your bill might go up because of the cost of electricity.\"",
      "Unpaid bills",
      "Energy costs eat up a larger share of low-income families' budgets compared to higher-earners. Low-income households spend roughly 8.6% of their incomes on energy costs, compared to 3% for those that are higher up the income ladder, according to NEADA.",
      "Worryingly, the lowest earners could struggle to afford to keep their homes cool, Wolfe noted. The most recent Census Household Pulse Survey found that 37% of low- and moderate-income households could not afford their energy bills for at least one month between April 2023 and April 2024.",
      "If those households find themselves in a financial crunch this summer, they may opt to turn off their air conditioning, which could pose serious health risks, noted Wolfe.",
      "\"Last winter was cold, so they're just getting over paying their heating bills, and are now facing higher summer cooling costs,\" Wolfe explained. \"And while people understand that if you don't use heat in the winter, your pipes will freeze, that won't happen in the summer.\"",
      "Reluctance to turn on one's air conditioning can have adverse health effects like heat stroke. \"While this won't do damage to your building, it will do damage to you,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Extreme heat and health",
      "Public assistance programs haven't kept pace with the evolving climate, according to Wolfe. \"We're having heat waves that are lasting longer, and the systems in place to protect families have not kept up,\" he said.",
      "This summer's cooling cost forecast should be taken as a sign that state and federal assistance programs require modernization, according to Wolfe.

      "The U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Ratings on Friday, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "The downgrade from the top rating of Aaa to Aa1 \"reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\" the credit rating firm said in a statement on Friday.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" Moody's added.",
      "Moody's also highlighted the environment of heightened policy uncertainty driven by Mr. Trump's evolving trade priorities.",
      "Moody's is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade U.S. government debt. In August 2011, Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+, and in August 2023\u00a0Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating a notch from AAA to AA+.",
      "Moody's said it expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by \"increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.''",
      "\"Even Obama economists warned the Biden administration and congressional Democrats against recklessly wasting trillions on COVID 'stimulus' bills \u2013 spending that piled on our national debt, fueled runaway inflation, and forced the Fed to raise interest rates for everyday Americans,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement Friday to CBS News in response to the downgrade. \"The Trump administration and Republicans are focused on fixing Biden's mess by slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse in government and passing The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to get our house back in order. If Moody's had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 06:48:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimated\u00a0in a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill on Monday night after Democratic opposition\u00a0tanked an initial attempt to advance the measure earlier this month amid concern over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family.",
      "The first-of-its-kind legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. After the measure advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in March, Senate GOP leadership first brought the measure to the floor earlier this month. But the measure had lost Democratic support in the intervening weeks amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The measure moved forward in a 66-32 vote after gaining the support of some Democratic holdouts.",
      "Monday's vote was to limit debate on the bill, allowing the Senate to move forward to final passage.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats for blocking the measure from advancing earlier this month, saying Monday, \"this bill reflects the bipartisan consensus on this issue, and it's had an open and bipartisan process since the very beginning.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, argued that Senate Democrats \"inexplicably chose to block this legislation\" earlier this month.",
      "Since the failed vote earlier this month, negotiators returned to the table. And ahead of the procedural vote Monday, the measure saw backing from at least one Democrat as Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia advocated for the measure, calling it a \"meaningful step forward,\" though he added that it's \"not perfect.\"",
      "\"The stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can't afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\" Warner said in a statement. \"We need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\"",
      "Still, Warner pointed to concerns he said are shared among many senators about the Trump family's \"use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,\" after it was announced earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.",
      "Warner said senators \"have a duty to shine a light on these abuses,\" but he argued \"we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has been among the leading voices advocating for adding anti-corruption reforms to the legislation. Warren has outlined a handful of issues with the bill, saying that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Warren said her concerns have not been addressed and urged her colleagues to vote against the updated version.",
      "\"While a strong stablecoin bill is the best possible outcome, this weak bill is worse than no bill at all,\" Warren said. \"A bill that meaningfully strengthens oversight of the stablecoin market is worth enacting. A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the president's corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.\"",
      "The measure fell short of the 60 votes necessary to move forward earlier this month, with all Senate Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 opposing. Paul has reservations about overregulation, while Hawley voted against the bill in part because it doesn't prohibit big tech companies from creating their own stablecoins.",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sponsored the legislation, defended the measure on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday. He outlined that a lack of regulatory framework, which the bill would provide, makes for uncertainty \u2014 and results in innovative technology moving offshore. The Tennessee Republicans urged that \"this will fix it,\" while arguing that the bill has strong bipartisan support.",
      "\"We have broad policy agreement, Democrats and Republicans,\" Hagerty said. \"The question is can we get past the partisan politics and allow us to actually have a victory.\"",

      "Despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts last year, mortgage rates have remained near their 25-year peak because they tend to track the 10-year Treasury bond, which is sensitive to economic conditions.

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 06:53:37 -0400",
    "summary": "About half of states have broadened Medicaid, the state-federal low-income health care program, to pay for social services such as housing and nutritional support.",
    "story": [
      "During his first administration, President Trump's top health officials gave North Carolina permission to use Medicaid money for social services not traditionally covered by health insurance. It was a first-in-the-nation experiment to funnel health care money into housing, nutrition, and other social services.",
      "Some poor and disabled Medicaid patients became eligible for benefits, including security deposits and first month's rent for housing, rides to medical appointments, wheelchair ramps, and even prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Such experimental initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable Americans while saving taxpayers on costly medical procedures and expensive emergency room care are booming nationally. Without homes or healthy food, people risk getting sicker, becoming homeless, and experiencing even more trouble controlling chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Former President Joe Biden encouraged states to go big on new benefits, and the availability of social services exploded in states red and blue. Since North Carolina's launch, at least 24 other states have followed by expanding social service benefits covered by Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 a national shift that's turning a system focused on sick care into one that prioritizes prevention. And though Mr. Trump was pivotal to the expansion, he's now reversing course regardless of whether evidence shows it works.",
      "In Mr. Trump's second term, his administration is throwing participating states from California to Arkansas into disarray, arguing that social services should not be paid for by government health insurance. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants states permission to experiment, have rescinded its previous broad directive, arguing that the Biden administration went too far.",
      "\"This administration believes that the health-related social needs guidance distracted the Medicaid program from its core mission: providing excellent health outcomes for vulnerable Americans,\" CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a statement.",
      "\"This decision prevents the draining of resources from Medicaid for potentially duplicative services that are already provided by other well-established federal programs, including those that have historically focused on food insecurity and affordable housing,\" Howden added, referring to food stamps and low-income housing vouchers provided through other government agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, has also proposed axing funding for low-income housing and food programs administered by agencies including the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture \u2014 on top of Republican proposals for broader Medicaid cuts.",
      "The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with both liberal and conservative leaders worried that the shift will upend multibillion-dollar investments already underway. Social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can cause \u2014 or worsen \u2014 physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to sky-high health care spending. Medical care delivered in hospitals and clinics, for instance, accounts for only roughly 15% of a person's overall health, while a staggering 85% is influenced by social factors such as access to healthy food and shelter for sleep, said Anthony Iton, a policy expert on social determinants of health.",
      "Health care experts warn the disinvestment will come at a price.",
      "\"It will just lead to more death, more suffering, and higher health care costs,\" said Margot Kushel, a primary care doctor in San Francisco and a leading researcher on homelessness and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced in a March 4 memo that it was rescinding Biden-era guidance dramatically expanding experimental benefits known as health-related social needs. Federal waivers are required for states to use Medicaid funds for most nontraditional social services outside of hospitals and clinics.",
      "Last month, the administration told states that these services, which can also include high-speed internet and storage units, should not be part of Medicaid.",
      "Future waiver requests allowing Medicaid to provide social services \u2014 a liberal philosophy \u2014 will be considered on a \"case-by-case basis,\" the administration said. Rather, it has signaled a conservative shift toward requiring most Medicaid beneficiaries to prove that they're working or trying to find jobs, which puts an estimated 36 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage.",
      "\"What they're arguing is Medicaid has been expanded far beyond basic health care and it needs to be cut back to provide only basic coverage to those most desperately in need,\" said Mark Peterson, a health policy expert at UCLA. \"They're making the case, which is not widely shared by specialists in the health care field, that it's not the job of taxpayers and Medicaid to pay for all this stuff outside the traditional heath care system.\"",
      "Although states have not received formal guidance to end their social experiments, Peterson and other health policy researchers expect the administration not to renew waivers, which typically run in five-year intervals. Worse, legal experts say programs underway could be halted early.",
      "Evidence supporting social investments by Medicaid is still nascent. An expansion in Massachusetts that provided food benefits reduced ER visits and hospitalizations, for instance. But often, it's a mixed bag.",
      "California is going the biggest, investing $12 billion over five years to provide a slew of new services, from intensive case management to help people with severe behavioral health conditions to housing and food assistance through a pair of federal waivers. The most popular benefits provided by health insurers are those that help homeless people on Medicaid by placing them in apartments or securing beds in recovery homes, covering up to $5,000 for security deposits, and preventing eviction.",
      "Since the CalAIM program launched in 2022, it has served only a small fraction of the state's nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries, with roughly 577,000 referrals for benefits. Yet it has improved and even saved the lives of some of those lucky enough to get help, including Eric Jones, a 65-year-old Los Angeles resident.",
      "\"When I got diabetes, I didn't know what to do and I had a hard time getting to my medical appointments,\" said Jones, who lost his housing this year when his mom died but received services through his Medi-Cal insurer, L.A. Care. \"My case manager got me rides to my appointments and also helped me get into an apartment.\"",
      "California is considering making some of its social services permanent after the CalAIM waivers expire at the end of 2026. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration is adding more housing services, including up to six months of free rent under a third waiver approved by the Biden administration. Medi-Cal officials contended early evidence shows CalAIM has led to better care coordination and fewer hospital and ER visits.",
      "\"We are fully committed,\" said Susan Philip, a deputy director for the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program. \"We have invested so much.\"",
      "Health insurers, which deliver Medicaid coverage and receive greater funding to cover these additional benefits, say they're worried the Trump administration will end or curtail the programs. \"If we do things the same old way, we're just going to generate the same old results \u2014 people getting sicker and health care costs continuing to rise,\" said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers.",
      "Industry leaders say the expansion is already changing lives.",
      "\"We believe wholeheartedly that housing is health, food is health, so seeing these programs disappear would be devastating,\" said Kelly Bruno-Nelson, executive director of Medi-Cal for CalOptima Health, a health insurance provider in Orange County.",
      "Oregon is also providing low-income Medicaid patients with a range of new services, including home-delivered healthy meals and rental payment assistance. Residents can even qualify for air conditioners, heaters, air filters, power generators, and mini fridges. State Medicaid officials say they remain committed to providing the benefits but worry about federal cuts.",
      "\"Climate change and housing instability are huge indicators of poor health,\" said Josh Balloch, vice president of health policy and communications at AllCare Health, a Medicaid insurer in Oregon. \"We hope to prove to the federal government that this is a good return on their investment.\"",
      "But even as the Trump administration curtails waivers, it is retaining discretion to provide social services in Medicaid, just on a smaller scale. Supporters say it's fair to scrutinize where to draw the line on taxpayer spending, arguing that there isn't always a direct health connection.",
      "\"We're seeing these things increase, with the free rent, and we're seeing some states pay for free internet, paying for furniture,\" said Kody Kinsley, who previously served as North Carolina's top health official. \"We know there's evidence for food and housing, but with all of these new benefits, we need to look closely at the evidence and the linkage to what actually drives health.\"",
      "Current North Carolina officials say they're confident the new social services Medicaid provides in their state have resulted in better health and lower overall spending on expensive and acute care. Medicaid recipients there can even use the program to buy farm-fresh produce.",
      "While it's too soon to know whether these experiments have been effective elsewhere in the United States, early evidence in North Carolina shows promise: The state had saved $1,020 per participant a year into its experiment \u2014 operating in mostly rural counties \u2014 by reducing ER trips and hospitalizations.",
      "State health officials also touted the economic benefits of driving business to family farms, home improvement contractors, and community-based organizations providing housing and social services.",
      "\"I welcome the challenge of demonstrating the effectiveness of our programs. It's making for healthier people and healthier budgets,\" said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina's Medicaid program. \"Family farms that were on the verge of collapse after Hurricane Helene are now benefiting from a steady income while they also serve their community.\"",

      "\"Sneakerheads\" continue to line up for Nike's Air Jordans, the most successful basketball shoe in history. The first Air Jordan shoe \u2013 the iconic black and red with a Nike swoosh \u2013 was released to the public 40 years ago for $65.",
      "The shoe revolutionized the sneaker industry, but it almost didn't happen.",
      "Michael Jordan's game-changing sneaker",
      "Howard White, a Nike veteran and founding father of the Jordan Brand now serving as its senior vice president, was in the room in 1984 with untested NBA rookie Michael Jordan to meet with Nike at its headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. Jordan was practically dragged into the meeting by his parents, Deloris and James Jordan.",
      "The stakes were high for Nike, then a relatively small sneaker company.",
      "\"This was bigger than anything that we'd done. You know, typically a great player would get like a hundred thousand dollars. But this was so unique in terms of just doing it, I mean, just having the guts to make something like this happen,\" White explained to \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" while wearing Christian Dior Jordans, which retail up to $17,000 dollars.",
      "The offer: $2.5 million for Jordan to wear their shoes. That was triple what anyone else in the league was making at the time.",
      "Jordan ended up taking the deal \u2013 and the rest is sneaker history. He went on to lead the Chicago Bulls to six championships, while sporting his shoe brand.",
      "Nike hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years. Instead, they sold $126 million in year one.",
      "Much of that success is thanks to Jordan's ability to seemingly defy gravity with his \"hang time,\" soaring across the paint for legendary dunks. He solidified his nickname \"Air Jordan\" when he\u00a0got a perfect score with his free throw line dunk in the 1987 NBA All-Star Slam Dunk Contest.",
      "Jordan still \"very integral to the operation\"",
      "Nike's marketing approach for the Air Jordan was groundbreaking, joining the cultural conversation in ways few ads had before.",
      "\"In order to translate what he did as a man into what we do as a brand, you have to start with the series of principles we call them ethos,\" Jason Mayden, chief design officer for the Jordan Brand, told \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "\"So you first start with connectivity, why this product has relevance and reverence. Then you put that into a very strict process that we call visionary. And so what's interesting is we have a playbook. I can't show you what's in it but you can see by the outside,\" he joked.",
      "The Jordan Brand, a standalone division within Nike, generates some $7 billion for Nike annually. They've released a new design every year for the past four decades. Next up: the top secret \"Jordan 40.\"",
      "Forty years later, Mayden says Jordan is still involved with the Air Jordan brand.",
      "\"He's very integral to the operation. He sees everything. He trusts us a lot. He has opinions on things that are near and dear to him,\" he said.",
      "Bigger than basketball",
      "Sean Williams runs the SOLEcial Studies CommUNITY Academy, a Brooklyn-based program dedicated to studying, promoting and collecting shoes \u2013 some 40,000 pairs, he says, since the first Air Jordans came out. He says it has given him his life's purpose.",
      "\"Sneakers are wearable art. So if you take the artistic approach to interpreting a story through certain features on the shoes, certain colorways going behind the design often, and talking to the people who actually design and make these shoes, you're giving the sneakers a level of depth in AKA storytelling that convinces them, that they're making the right purchase when they buy these secrets,\" Williams explained.",
      "For the Jordan Brand, Air Jordans are bigger than basketball. It's about empowering people to believe more in themselves.",
      "White, who still talks to Jordan, says he often reminds the basketball legend that Air Jordan's success is because it's not actually the story of a shoe.",

      "A federal judge in Massachusetts on Thursday blocked the Trump administration's attempted dismantling of the Department of Education.",
      "Judge Myong Joun, a Biden appointee, blocked the Trump administration from carrying out its reduction-in-force, or RIF, at the Education Department, which was announced on March 11. Joun also blocked transferring the management of federal student loans and special education functions out of the Education Department.",

      "Two lawsuits were brought against the Education Department and were consolidated in this case: a number of states who had sued and some local school districts from around the country.",
      "\"Indeed, prior to the RIF, the Department was already struggling to meet its goals, so it is only reasonable to expect that an RIF of this magnitude will likely cripple the Department. The idea that Defendants' actions are merely a 'reorganization' is plainly not true,\" Joun wrote in his decision.",
      "\"Defendants do acknowledge, as they must, that the Department cannot be shut down without Congress's approval, yet they simultaneously claim that their legislative goals (obtaining Congressional approval to shut down the Department) are distinct from their administrative goals (improving efficiency),\" Joun wrote.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4, blocking the attempt to establish the nation's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An evenly divided Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a lower court decision that invalidated a contract approved by the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board that established the nation's first religious charter school, blocking the effort in a closely watched case that posed a test for the separation of church and state.",
      "The high court split 4-4, which leaves in place the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate in the case. The high court issued a one line, unsigned decision stating \"the judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court.\"",
      "Argued at the end of April, the legal fight could have opened the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools. But following the arguments, it appeared that the outcome of the case would hinge on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program. The issue of whether religious institutions must be permitted to participate in state charter school systems is likely to land before the Supreme Court again in a case likely to involve all nine justices.",
      "The legal battle over the attempt to create St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma came on the heels of a trio of recent rulings in which the Supreme Court sided with religious families and institutions challenging state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violating the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause.",
      "In 2017, the high court ruled that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court said that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said\u00a0Maine cannot limit\u00a0a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Nicole Stelle Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who authored a\u00a0paper\u00a0that suggested states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause, said she was disappointed with the decision but noted that it does not set precedent.",
      "\"The question whether barring religious charter schools violates the Constitution remains live, and I remain confident that the Court will eventually rule that it does,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Garnett is friends with Barrett, who also taught at Notre Dame Law School before she became a judge. The university's Religious Liberty Clinic represented St. Isidore.",
      "A decision in favor of the school could have led to the country's first religious charter school. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican who argued against establishment of the school, had warned that a decision allowing its contract to stand would upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a\u00a02023 report\u00a0from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation,\u00a0according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond\u00a0warned\u00a0against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an\u00a0earlier analysis\u00a0from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "Oklahoma's charter school board and St. Isidore's appealed the state court ruling to the Supreme Court, and it said in January it would review that decision.",

      "The California Air Resources Board, a state body that designed the vehicle emissions regulations and requested the waivers, measures and sets pollution standards in California to comply with the Clean Air Act. It claims that the state has applied for over 100 waivers that have resulted in vehicles being 99% cleaner in terms of pollution, compared to vehicles from 1970. The board says they have never had a waiver revoked in the 50 years it has had the ability to enact them.",
      "\"The law is that the Clean Air Act says California can set its own standards if they are more stringent, more environmentally protective than whatever the federal government standard is,\" said Mary Nichols, who was the California Air Resources Board chairwoman from 1975-1982 and then from 2007-2020. Nichols told CBS News that if Congress uses Congressional Review to revoke the waivers, the state of California will sue the federal government.",
      "California state Attorney General Rob Bonta told Politico in March that his office is prepared for a legal fight and said, \"We don't think it's an appropriate use of the Congressional Review Act, and we're prepared to defend ourselves if it's wrongfully weaponized.\"",
      "Voting down California's waivers is expected to impact cities and states around the country, as 16 additional states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards.",

      "The auto industry has been pushing for Republicans to revoke California's waivers. The Speciality Equipment Market Association represents the automotive aftermarket industry where a third of its businesses are dependent on internal combustion engines and see the waivers and expansion of electric vehicles as a threat to business.",

      "The president on Tuesday said his administration had \"selected an architecture\" for the \"state-of-the-art system,\" which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars and put U.S. weapons in space for the first time in history.",
      "What is the Golden Dome and how will it work?",
      "The Golden Dome is a multilayered defense system that the president, speaking in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said will deploy \"next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors.\"",
      "\"The Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" the president said, adding that he wants it to be operational before his term ends.",
      "The concept includes both ground- and space-based capabilities that would defend against missiles by: detecting and destroying them ahead of launch, intercepting them early in flight, halting them midcourse and stopping them in the last few moments of approaching a target.",
      "The initiative would have multiple layers that expand on what the U.S. already has and build new programs to counter the full range of aerial threats, according to Gen. Gregory Guillot, the head of U.S. Northern Command, who testified in front of Congress in April.",
      "He described a domain awareness layer to track threats and then two other layers: \"the first being an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) defeat layer, which largely exists today with the GBIs (ground-based interceptors) that can defeat a North Korean threat and then an air layer that would defeat cruise missiles and air threats.\"",
      "\"The time to intercept a missile is when it launches,\" retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, a CBS News contributor and former commander of the U.S. Central Command, said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" Thursday. He said that early in a missile's flight, it is on \"a highly predictable\" path, can't maneuver and can't deploy systems to spoof radars, making that the ideal time to disable it.",
      "\"And to do that, you really have to go into space. You have to have a space-based system to do that,\" McKenzie said. \"That's very possible. We've looked at this at different times.\"",
      "McKenzie added he hopes \"that's where our thinking and our science is going to take us.\"",
      "\"This is not going to be off the cuff,\" Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS News in an interview.",
      "\"This is going to be well-rooted in the systems engineering and the understanding of the threat and in the overall architecture plans that have been in the works for a long time,\" Karako said.",
      "How much will the Golden Dome cost?",
      "The new initiative, which will encompass many programs, will be built in states including Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Alaska, according to Mr. Trump, and involve multiple American defense and technology companies that have not yet been selected.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a cost of $542 billion for the space-based components alone.",
      "\"The cost is certainly a daunting thing,\" McKenzie said. \"But on the other hand, the ability to defend the United States against a nuclear attack, not necessarily a massive Russian attack, but, you know, an attack from North Korea, an attack from Iran, a potential attack from a country like Pakistan, who's working to develop an ICBM. Those are all things that I think are feasible, and I think certainly are worth the cost that would be necessary to work the system.\"",
      "Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, which said on X it is ready to support the dome mission, describes it as a \"revolutionary concept.\"",
      "\"This is a Manhattan Project-scale mission, one that is both urgent and crucial to America's security,\" the company says.",
      "Lockheed Martin COO Frank St. John said it would protect against nuclear missiles, as well as intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles, and other threats.",
      "Mr. Trump said U.S. Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein would be responsible for overseeing the dome's progress.",
      "However, there is no funding yet to match the plan, which is \"still in the conceptual stage,\" Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told senators on Tuesday at a hearing. The Pentagon is also still developing the requirements that the dome will have to meet, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Israel's Iron Dome",
      "The Golden Dome idea first came to public light during Mr. Trump's joint address to Congress in March, when he asked for funding for it. He said, \"Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it, too.\"",
      "The president was referring to Israel's Iron Dome, which at least partially inspired the Golden Dome concept. Israel's system, installed in 2011 to defend against incoming projectiles, largely addresses shorter-range threats like rockets, while two other air defense systems work to defend against missiles.",
      "The Iron Dome, developed with U.S. backing, has intercepted thousands of rockets and has a success rate topping 90%, according to Israel.",
      "China responds",
      "Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said her country urges the U.S. \"to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself,\" she said at a Wednesday briefing in Beijing, according to news agencies. \"This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this.\"",
      "She also said the Golden Dome plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield\" and \"fuels an arms race.\"",
      "\"It's kind of humorous that the Chinese would talk about militarizing space, since I would guess they've done more work on militarizing space than any other nation in the world,\" McKenzie said. \"I would argue this is an inherently defensive system, and it's designed to protect the United States from attack.\"",
      "A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment shows that the U.S. military expects, over the coming decade, to contend with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication.\" It also said that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "China has been rapidly developing missile and other military capabilities, while deepening ties with Russia. The two nations said in a statement earlier this month that the dome project was \"deeply destabilizing in nature\" and would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",
      "Karako said that the Golden Dome initiative is \"a belated realignment of U.S. missile defense policy\" to counter both China and Russia, countries that the last two administrations in their national defense strategies have pointed to as strategic competitors.",
      "\"Could [the Golden Dome] launch another spiral of offensive developments to try to break through?\" McKenzie said. \"Certainly that's possible. And I recognize that's a possibility. Having said that, I still think it's an objective worth pursuing.\"",

      "The Treasury Department said it plans to stop manufacturing the penny, calling time one one of the first coins minted by the U.S. government.",
      "The federal agency placed its final order for penny blanks this month, with the United States Mint slated to end manufacturing of the penny when that runs out, a Treasury official told CBS MoneyWatch. The blanks \u2014 flat, metal discs that the Mint turns into coins \u2014 will run out in early 2026, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.",
      "The penny, which dates from the early days of the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. The 1-cent coin cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "Ending production of the penny will save the Mint about $56 million in annual savings, the Treasury said on Thursday.",
      "Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "The Trump administration had recently signaled it was out to stop making the 1-cent coin, with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency saying in January that the penny was too costly\u00a0to produce.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House narrowly passed President Trump's domestic policy bill Thursday following a dramatic all-night session and days of negotiations.",
      "In a 215 to 214 vote, all but two House Republicans supported the massive budget package \u2014 the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda \u2014 in a vote that came hours after unveiling an updated version of the legislation that GOP leaders hoped would satisfy enough holdouts. GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio opposed the bill. House Freedom Caucus chairman Andy Harris of Maryland voted present.",
      "The measure cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the wee hours of the morning, teeing up the vote on final passage after days of consternation among the House Republican conference.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition.",
      "\"We look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this once-in-a-generation legislation,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said after the vote Thursday, pledging to get the package to the president's desk in the coming weeks. \"We're going to get it there by Independence Day on July 4, and we are going to celebrate a new golden age in America.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt posted on social media that the bill's passage \"would not have happened without President Trump's leadership.\"",
      "The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities, and has overcome several setbacks since the beginning of the year after GOP leadership made repeated assurances to holdouts that their concerns would be addressed later if they kept the legislation moving forward.",
      "But Johnson's self-imposed deadline to get the measure across the finish line in the House by Memorial Day quickly approached, the Louisiana Republican was facing increasing opposition from several factions of his party to parts of the bill involving Medicaid, the state and local tax deduction and other provisions.",
      "A 42-page manager's amendment released by House GOP leaders late Wednesday included changes to win over both the budget hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus and blue-state Republicans pressing to ease the tax burden on their constituents. The new version would, among other things, move up the implementation of Medicaid work requirements from the beginning of 2029 to the end of 2026, a change sought by hardliners.",
      "Another change to the bill would more quickly end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "Johnson could only afford three defections on the bill, with all members present and voting, given his slim majority. Massie was the sole Republican to oppose the key procedural vote on the measure earlier Thursday.",
      "\"If something is beautiful, you don't do it after midnight,\" Massie said on the House floor.",
      "Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, delivered his final pitch to House Republicans ahead of the vote, urging that the bill will deliver on GOP promises.",
      "\"If you vote no, you're voting against American energy, you're voting against securing America's border, you're voting against helping those middle class families,\" Scalise said.",
      "Johnson touted the legislation on the House floor, saying it \"gets Americans back to winning again.\"",
      "\"This one big beautiful bill is the most consequential legislation that any, any party has passed, certainly under a majority this thin,\" the speaker said.",
      "All Democrats opposed the package. And after House Democrats threw up procedural roadblocks overnight to delay a vote on the measure, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries railed against the bill in a speech from the House floor early Thursday, calling it a \"reckless, regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam.\"",
      "\"This is one big, ugly bill that House Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people under the cover of darkness,\" Jeffries said.",
      "The New York Democrat, alluding to the midterm elections next year, warned that \"this day might very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.\"",
      "The vote came after right-wing holdouts met Wednesday afternoon with Mr. Trump and Johnson at the White House. After the meeting, Johnson huddled with other members of the Republican conference to brief them on the changes while House Freedom Caucus members met separately.",
      "Before the White House meeting Wednesday, Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he wasn't optimistic the bill could pass this week, though he was \"pretty confident\" it could be passed within 10 days.",
      "But other budget hardliners said after the meeting that negotiations were headed in the right direction.",
      "During a visit to the Capitol Tuesday, Mr. Trump pressured Republicans to fall in line behind the legislation \u2014 which House GOP leaders have named \"The Big, Beautiful Bill\" \u2014 and suggested that those who don't could face primary challenges.",
      "In a statement of administrative policy issued Wednesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget urged House Republicans to pass the measure, saying it \"reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration,\" adding, \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "The details of the updated version of the legislation came together in the final hours before the vote.",
      "Johnson also negotiated with Republicans from blue states over a provision on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The moderates advocated for an increase to the SALT cap, currently set at $10,000, but argued that the $30,000 cap outlined in the package remained too low. An agreement was reached to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, according to the managers amendment.",
      "The vote marks a key victory for Johnson, after days of shepherding his conference through difficult disagreement over the legislation. But even with the victory, the legislation is expected to face resistance in the Senate \u2014 where numerous Republicans have said they'll seek changes to the bill.",
      "Johnson met with Senate Republicans to discuss the budget process Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the speaker would \"like to see as little change to the product as possible, because they cobble together a very delicate balance over there.\" But Thune said \"the Senate will have its imprint on it.\"",

When he arrived on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump suggested that any GOP member who doesn't back what he and Republicans have deemed the \"big, beautiful bill\" would be \"knocked out so fast,\" a warning to a handful of \"grandstanders.\"",
      "\"It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Johnson can only afford three defections in a floor vote, if all members are present and voting, given his slim majority. All Democrats are expected to oppose it.",
      "\"I would say that if the vote were held right now, it dies a painful death,\" Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee said Tuesday evening.",
      "But a day later, on Wednesday evening, Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota expressed confidence in the outcome: \"I believe we'll have the votes.\"",
      "Rules committee meets overnight \u2014 as conservatives push for more spending cuts",
      "When the Rules Committee began meeting early Wednesday, Democrats chastised Republicans over the timing.",
      "\"If you guys think this ugly bill is so damn beautiful, like Trump keeps saying, you should have the courage to debate it in primetime,\" Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said.",
      "Republicans, however, rejected the request to adjourn the meeting until daylight hours. And the committee's chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said the Rules Committee \"has a long tradition of meeting late into the evening and reporting legislation long after most of America has gone to bed.\"",
      "The committee's rare overnight meeting took place as Republican leadership races to pass the budget package before its self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Johnson has been meeting with the different factions in recent days to hear the demands and build a consensus around a modified version of the legislation that was produced by nearly a dozen House committees.",
      "More conservative members, who are upset that that bill does not make steep enough spending cuts to significantly bring down the deficit, have pushed for Medicaid work requirements to kick in much sooner than a 2029 deadline. They also want to eliminate all the clean energy subsidies that were implemented under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden.",
      "After right-wing opposition appeared to remain firm overnight, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday morning the White House offered a proposal that would enable these holdouts to back the budget bill, if it were to be included in the package.",
      "\"I don't think it can be done today,\" Harris said. \"I think that there is a pathway forward that we can see.\"",
      "Within the manager's amendment released late Wednesday was a provision that would move up the timeline for Medicaid work requirements to kick in from the beginning of 2029 to the end of 2026, while also phasing out some of the clean energy subsidies earlier than previously outlined in the package.",
      "Conservatives have also been pushing to change the rate by which the federal government pays states for Medicaid, a point of contention with moderates, who have warned against larger cuts to the program.",
      "Johnson reiterated earlier this week that the change has \"been off the table for quite some time,\" however. And Mr. Trump said ahead of the meeting Tuesday morning that \"we're not doing anything cutting of anything meaningful,\" adding that on Medicaid, \"the only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Before the manager's amendment's release, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the original version of the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. And a new preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found it would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion.",
      "SALT conflict may be resolved",
      "Right-wing Republicans weren't the only ones with objections to the legislation, though. Blue-state Republicans opposed a provision on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and they threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands were met.",
      "Prior to the SALT deduction cap, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits\u00a0wealthy homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But others also pointed out that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Republicans who represent blue states balked at the $30,000 cap outlined in the package and reached an agreement to further increase it to $40,000. The manager's amendment included a provision that increases the SALT deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said Wednesday night that with the increase he believed all those opposed to that provision were now on board.",
      "Mr. Trump weighed in on the SALT issue Tuesday, suggesting that he opposes raising the cap because he claimed Democratic governors from states like New York, Illinois and California would benefit, calling them the \"biggest\" beneficiaries. But after the group of moderates met with the speaker Tuesday evening, Johnson indicated that they had \"found a point of compromise.\"",
      "According to a senior White House official, Mr. Trump told the House GOP conference during the meeting that they should not let division over the SALT cap get in the way of the bill, and said they should not touch Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud and abuse, along with cutting benefits for noncitizens and imposing work requirements. The official said Mr. Trump also made clear he wants every Republican to vote \"yes\" on the bill, while saying he's losing patience with the remaining holdouts.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday said it placed eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records on a deportation flight that lawyers alleged was destined for the violence-plagued African country of South Sudan, in its latest attempt to deport migrants to countries that are not their own.",
      "The administration has not publicly disclosed the whereabouts of the flight, which a federal judge on Wednesday said \"unquestionably\" violated a court ruling blocking deportations to third countries without allowing detainees to contest their removal.",
      "Top Department of Homeland Security officials said the eight men were in the U.S. illegally and hailed from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam. The department shared case information indicating all the would-be deportees had criminal convictions, including for homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "In a statement Wednesday evening, DHS released the names of the eight men. They were identified as Dian Peter Domach of South Sudan, Enrique Arias-Hierro of Cuba, Jose Manuel Rodriguez-Quinones of Cuba, Thongxay Nilakout of Laos, Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez of Mexico, Kyaw Mya of Myanmar, Nyo Myint of Myanmar and Tuan Thanh Phan of Vietnam.",
      "On Tuesday, immigration lawyers told the federal district court in Massachusetts that at least two men from Myanmar and Vietnam were likely being deported to South Sudan, saying the reported deportation flight would violate an order by federal judge Brian Murphy that blocked deportations to third countries unless detainees were provided certain due process rights.",
      "During a briefing in Washington on Wednesday to discuss a migrant flight to South Sudan, top DHS officials confirmed a deportation flight had left Texas on Tuesday, saying the eight detainees from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam were being transported as part of \"a diplomatic and military security operation.\"",
      "The officials, however, declined to confirm the final destination of the flight or any formal arrangement with South Sudan's government, citing operational and safety concerns. The officials also said they could not disclose the exact whereabouts of the detainees.",
      "Following an emergency motion by the lawyers who alerted him of the potential deportation flight to South Sudan, Murphy, the federal judge in Massachusetts, ordered the Trump administration late Tuesday to retain \"custody and control\" of the would-be deportees.",
      "In a written order Wednesday, the judge also ordered the government to give six deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews, which usually assess whether a migrant is legally entitled to stay in the U.S. because of a risk of persecution or torture. If they express a fear that falls short of that standard, they must get at least 15 days to \"reopen immigration proceedings to challenge the potential third-party removal,\" the judge said.",
      "The Trump administration was also ordered to provide status reports every seven days, and to maintain custody over the deportees.",
      "On Wednesday, top DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the eight men who had been placed on the deportation flight that departed Texas remained in U.S. custody.",
      "McLaughlin also sharply criticized Murphy's ruling. \"It is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try and dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America,\" McLaughlin said, accusing Murphy of \"trying to force\" officials to bring back dangerous individuals to the U.S.",
      "During a hearing Wednesday, a Justice Department lawyer told Murphy the flight in question had landed somewhere and also confirmed the men remained in U.S. custody but said the current location of the flight could only be discussed in private, out of earshot of the press.",
      "The Justice Department said the situation was dangerous for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees on the flight because of the severity of the detainees' criminal records.",
      "After a private conversation with both parties, Murphy said that the government's attempted deportations \"are unquestionably violative of this court's order.\" He noted that the detainees were put on the deportation flight less than 24 hours after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "\"I don't see how anybody could say that these individuals had a meaningful opportunity to object\" to their removal, Murphy said. \"They did not offer any opportunity to object.\" Murphy noted the detainees were put on a deportation flight less than a day after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "The Justice Department attorneys arguing the case said Murphy's orders in the case were \"not specific enough,\" which gave rise to \"misunderstanding.\"",
      "Murphy did not rule out holding the Trump administration in contempt of court for violating his order, but said that issue would be \"left for another day.\"",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, President Trump's administration has staged an intense diplomatic effort to convince nations around the world to accept migrants who are not their own citizens, approaching nations like Libya and Rwanda to take in third-country deportees.",
      "Early on in Mr. Trump's second term, U.S. officials deported African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, and Venezuelan deportees accused of being gang members to El Salvador, where they remain detained at a notorious mega prison.",

    "story": [
      "Refugee admissions to the United States have all but ground to a halt \u2014 except for one group, or a \"small subset,\" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them on Tuesday: Afrikaners. They are members of the White ethnic minority that once led South Africa's brutal, four-decade apartheid regime, which ended in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president.",
      "The Trump administration has already welcomed the first group of Afrikaner asylum applicants, who were given expedited refugee status after claiming they were the victims of violence and discrimination in South Africa.",
      "Other Afrikaners are waiting, keen to take advantage of the offer of special treatment from the Trump administration to gain protected status and the right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "Those hopefuls have been meeting to share information on the process, including Dolf Grobler, who has already applied. The professional hunter told CBS News he has $2.5 million to help make America great again.",
      "\"I'm worried that the genocide, which is currently mainly focused on White farmers, is going to spread,\" he said. The claim of a White genocide is one that President Trump's adviser Elon Musk, whose family are Afrikaners, has backed.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday as the U.S. leader hosted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa for an official visit. The Afrikaner refugee program was a topic of discussion, along with trade and other matters. In the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted.",
      "\"Those people in many cases, are being executed, being executed, and they happen to be White, and most happen to be farmers,\" Mr. Trump said, calling the situation \"sort of the opposite of apartheid.\"",
      "\"People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people,\" Ramaphosa said.",
      "According to South African police, in the last three months of 2024, 12 people were murdered on farms there; one was a White farmer, while the others were Black laborers or security workers.  Asked if he believed life for him and his family was better under apartheid \u2014 an overtly racist minority-rule system that denied equal rights to South Africa's vast majority Black population \u2014 Grobler didn't hesitate.",
      "\"Yes,\" he told CBS News. \"I can't say in my heart that we are better off now.\" Although he did concede apartheid was wrong.",
      "Claims of a White genocide are often circulated by right-wing groups, but the view is not held widely within the Afrikaner community.",
      "Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, an academic at North-West University in South Africa, says the claims are simply untrue.",
      "\"There's no sign of it, never has been. In fact, Whites are economically the strongest group\" in South Africa, Croucamp told CBS News. \"64% of all boardrooms in South Africa are still White. The average incomes of White South Africans are vastly higher than Black South Africans ... they have better schools, they have better education, private health care. This is the land of milk and honey if you're White.\"",
      "Croucamp suspects the South African government's strong stance against Israel's actions in Gaza, and its relations with China, could have played some part in Mr. Trump's decision to embrace the controversial amnesty program for Afrikaners, but he believes there's more to it.",
      "\"In South Africa, right-wing groups, so-called civil society groups, we know that they have access to the Trump administration because they claim that. And just over the last few days, they have, several times, they said that they will speak to the American government, as if they have access to them. And if you listen to what Trump has said, it corresponds exactly with the genocide narrative that they sell and that they market,\" Croucamp said. \"So, I'm afraid I have to believe them when they say they have direct access to the Trump administration, and we see what Trump has been doing.\"",
      "Grilled about the refugee program Tuesday on Capitol Hill, in a testy exchange with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Secretary of State Rubio insisted that U.S. foreign policy \"doesn't require even-handedness, it involves prioritizing the interests of the United States. ... The United States has a right to pick and choose who they allow into the United States.\"",
      "White South Africans make up only about 7% of the country's population, but they still own more than half of all its farmland. And while the country has a staggeringly high crime rate, racial motives are not generally a factor, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein.",
      "He acknowledged that violent attacks on farmers do occur, especially in agricultural land near big cities, where there are often large, impoverished populations, but he said overall, \"I feel safe. I sleep with my doors open here on the farm.\"",
      "There have also been allegations that White farmers are the victims of land expropriation, with the government seizing farms without providing compensation. In January, Ramaphosa signed into law measures to expropriate mostly unused land for public use,  which his government said was necessary to address the consequences of decades of apartheid. While the law provides for fair compensation in most cases, it also allows for expropriation without compensation under limited  circumstances. And any measures can be challenged in court.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that it unfairly targets White landowners, though the law does not mention the race of anyone who could be affected under the legislation.",
      "And more importantly, there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended.",
      "Serfontein argues the problem isn't a deliberate effort by the government to seize White-owned land without compensation, but rather \"because of a dysfunctional government. The model is wrong.\"",
      "He said that for decades, land has been handed over to a Black population with compensation for former owners under established rules, but without any support for the new owners. So, almost a decade ago, Serfontein helped to launch a project aimed at training new Black farmers to work the land.",
      "To date, he says he's personally helped train more than 700 young Black farmers \u2014 the country's next generation of agricultural workers.",
      "\"I'm extremely positive, and so are the young people, the young farmers, they are positive,\" he said.",
      "As for a white genocide, he agreed with Croucamp, saying bluntly: \"It's not happening.\"",
      "Serfontein said he didn't know the histories of the Afrikaners who had already left for the U.S., and he didn't doubt they \"probably had some unhappy experiences in South Africa, about a number of things. But let me tell you that if you went to NAMPO last week \u2014 NAMPO is the biggest agricultural show in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 you would have found a vibe there between the farmers, young farmers, old farmers, Black farmers, White farmers, that you've never experienced before. They are so excited about the future of South Africa.\"",

      "In a fact sheet for the Community Policing Development microgrant program, the Trump administration eliminated language that encouraged police agencies to seek federal money for initiatives to help \"underserved populations,\" build trust in police, boost diversity in police departments and support community violence intervention.",
      "Instead, the administration lists \"immigration and border security,\" \"violent crime prevention\" and \"uplifting the image of the law enforcement profession\" as programs that are priorities for the highly sought-after grants, which are administered by the Justice Department's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) division.",
      "The instructions to local police departments for funding in 2025 mark a noticeable shift from the guidance issued by the Justice Department during the Biden administration a year earlier.",
      "The 2024 guidance prioritized efforts at \"building trust and legitimacy with the community\" and \"community violence intervention\" initiatives, which include efforts to combat racism, trauma, poverty and other triggers to violence.",
      "The Trump administration has shifted the grant instructions for 2025 to invite police to make a compelling argument that the money will help stiffen border security, reduce violent crime, improve police departments' public image, support \"opioids and drug market interruption\" and other priorities.",
      "Both the 2024 and 2025 instructions have an \"Open Topic Area\" for grant applications that don't fit into any of the listed categories.",
      "The change of language raises the prospect of a dramatic shift in which police agencies are granted money and what programs are approved for federal help.",
      "The Justice Department's COPS community policing development grants program has awarded more than $67 million to dozens of police agencies since 2023, including for some cities as large as New York, Boston and Los Angeles, and those as small as Bluefield, W.Va., and Bellevue, Neb., according to a review by CBS News.",
      "The shift could imperil money from some projects that have been highly touted in small and large U.S. cities.",
      "\"These are some significant changes,\" said Chiraag Baines, a former Justice Department attorney and Biden administration aide. \"There's a broader impact to this than just grant money. It's a statement about priorities and it could encourage police to give less priority to certain programs and initiatives if they think the Administration is going to be hostile to them.\"",
      "Baines said the newly-listed priorities for projects combatting violent crime and opioid abuse are important. But he added the new language encouraging police to apply for money for projects that \"uplift the image of law enforcement\" is a change \"that really confuses the issue. Police should be working to build trust and cooperation.\"",
      "Communities have proudly announced their grant awards for \"community violence interventions\" during the Biden administration.",
      "Cleveland Heights, Ohio, touted a program that got a 2023 grant as a successful initiative to reach at-risk youths. The city's announcement of the grant said the $175,000 award would be used for \"foot patrols in violence-impacted areas and forming a new outreach and mentorship program for Cleveland Heights.\"",
      "St. Petersburg, Fla., police are among the dozens of departments and cities to receive grants for initiatives to build \"trust and legitimacy with the community\" since 2021, including an approximately $174,000 grant in 2022.",
      "The agency told CBS News it used the grant to \"support 20 non-profit youth sports leagues.\" The police department also \"collaborated with the Tampa Bay Rays Baseball team to offer softball programs for at-risk girls, increasing access and participation.\"",
      "St. Petersburg won another $175,000 COPS grant, for police to help \"underserved populations\" in 2023. The department told CBS News it used the money for \"arts and educational mentorship\" for youth.",
      "The changes mark a paradigm shift, and have inflamed criticism from congressional Democrats. Rep. Glenn Ivey, a Democrat who was once a state prosecutor in Maryland, told CBS News, \"It is really a marked change in priorities from the last administration. Local communities count on these funds to augment their community policing efforts. Safer communities start with trust and security not fear and distrust. COPS grants should build up the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve, not tear them apart.\"",
      "A former Justice Department official who served in prior administrations told CBS News the shifting of grant criteria is common when the department changes leadership. But the official said the shift away from community violence intervention programs is a \"recipe for depriving law enforcement of the leads and witnesses that can solve cases and prevent crime. Community police cuts crime because people trust the police enough to work with them.\"",
      "Justice Department officials declined to answer specific questions about the changes in grant application language.",
      "A spokeswoman told CBS News in a written statement, \"Under the direction of Attorney General Bondi, the COPS office is committed to highlighting the important work that our law enforcement partners do and to supporting law enforcement through hiring and grant assistance.\"",
      "A review of prior COPS grants announcements shows a shift of language after then-President Joe Biden took office. The language in the 2022 COPS hiring grant fact sheet for police departments eliminated references from the first Trump administration that specified money was available for initiatives that focused on homeland security and school-based policing, and added language prioritizing \"diversity training\" projects.",
      "Even in a distinctively polarized political climate, federal COPS grants remain overwhelmingly popular and highly pursued by local police agencies. Grant awards are regularly touted by members of congress from both parties and publicly announced by local officials as victories for the community.",
      "A bipartisan group of federal legislators has introduced a bill to beef up funding for overall COPS grants. Rep. Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat whose district includes smaller communities in the Hudson Valley, co-sponsored the bill and said, \"Far too often, small and midsized police departments like ours lack the resources they need.\"",
      "Rep. Zach Nunn, an Iowa Republican who co-sponsored the measure, wrote, \"Every Iowa town deserves strong public safety, regardless of size or geography, and I'm proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to boost hiring and resources for law enforcement in our small and rural communities.\" Nunn's announcement said the proposal would \"reauthorize the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program with double the amount of federal funding.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Alexandria, Va., police department, which received a $175,000 grant last year to help serve \"underserved populations,\" told CBS News, \"The Department of Justice COPS Office plays a vital role in supporting law enforcement agencies across the country. Their funding and technical assistance have been instrumental in helping departments build long-standing relationships between police and the communities they serve.\"",
      "Some city officials and police departments declined to comment on their federal COPS grant awards, including Dearborn, Mich., which received an $88,816 grant for \"building trust\" in police in 2023.",

    "summary": "A dramatic standoff between the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Trump administration ended this week, with a federal judge ruling the government's efforts to dismantle the think tank were illegal.",
    "story": [
      "The leaders of the United States Institute for Peace regained control of their offices Wednesday, weeks after they were ejected from their positions by the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency in March.",
      "The dramatic turn of events happened in the wake of U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell's ruling on Monday that the takeover of USIP was \"unlawful\" and conducted by \"illegitimately-installed leaders.\" Howell further ruled that the action was \"null and void.\" The judge ruled after USIP's leaders sued the government.",
      "The Justice Department indicated Wednesday it plans to appeal Howell's ruling, and asked the judge to pause her order while an appellate court considers the case.",
      "At an impromptu press briefing on the steps of the USIP building Wednesday, acting President George Moose addressed reporters.",
      "\"We are now back in the building and we intend to resume our stewardship and custodianship,\" Moose said. \"It is not just the platform from which we've been doing our work. It is a symbol of the aspirations and the intent of the American people to be seen and to be peacemaker in the world.\"",
      "Howell's ruling was the culmination of a two-month legal battle that began after USIP employees were forcibly removed from the organization's building in downtown Washington with the help of Washington, D.C., Metropolitan police.",
      "The chain of events started on Feb. 19, when President Trump issued Executive Order 14217 declaring USIP \"unnecessary\" and terminating its leadership, most of its 300 staff members and its entire board. The organization was created by Congress as an \"independent nonprofit corporation.\"",
      "That set the stage for the dramatic standoff between the USIP leadership and DOGE \u2014 the cost-cutting team run by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 a month later. Representatives of DOGE gained access to the building with the help of a private security company, USIP spokesperson Liz Callihan said. During the standoff, Moose issued a statement saying \"DOGE has broken into our building.\"",
      "On March 17, DOGE seized control of the institute's headquarters and a newly installed president transferred ownership of the building to the Government Services Administration, which oversees contracting for the federal government and acts effectively as its landlord. The building was built specifically to house USIP and was paid for through a mix of public and privately donated money.",
      "USIP counsel George Foote also spoke at Wednesday's press conference. \"The Institute is the rightful possessor of this building, that George [Moose] is the rightful acting president\u2026 The effect of the judge's order was to outlaw everything that happened beginning with the president's dismissal of our board of directors\u2026so it never happened\" Foote said.",
      "USIP was established 41 years ago by Congress. Its mission is to provide analysis, education, and resources to those working for peace around the world and to reduce the chance that the U.S. government will be pulled into foreign conflict. In recent years, USIP staff have increasingly been deployed to hot zones overseas where they have taken part in conflict resolution between warring parties, including in Iraq and Papua New Guinea.",
      "A White House spokeswoman said in response to Howell's decision, \"President Trump is right to reduce failed, useless entities like USIP to their statutory minimum, and this rogue judge's attempt to impede on the separation of powers will not be the last say on this matter.\"",

    "summary": "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify medical exceptions under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.,",
    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department said it will bring an end to investigations launched during the Biden administration after the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department said Wednesday that it is starting the process of dismissing lawsuits against police departments in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, bringing an end to investigations launched during former President Joe Biden's administration. It will also put an end to proposed accountability agreements with the departments.",
      "The Trump administration said the consent decrees proposed by the Biden administration sought to subject the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments to sweeping terms that went beyond accusations of unconstitutional conduct and would have led to \"years of micromanagement\" of local departments.",
      "The federal involvement began following the deaths of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police and Breonna Taylor in a Louisville police shooting in 2020.",
      "\"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. \"Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division's failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees.\"",
      "In addition to taking steps to dismiss the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, the Trump administration also said it is closing investigations into police departments in Phoenix; Trenton, New Jersey; Memphis; Mount Vernon, New York; Oklahoma City and the Louisiana State Police. The Trump administration said it is retracting the Biden administration's findings of unconstitutional violations by all of the eight named departments, and is looking into potentially dismissing over a dozen other consent decrees across the country.",
      "The Justice Department's decision to drop the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis departments comes just days before the five-year mark since Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted in state court\u00a0on murder and manslaughter charges for Floyd's killing and went on to plead guilty in a federal civil rights case.",
      "In a filing with the federal court in Minnesota in the case against the city of Minneapolis, Justice Department lawyers said that the government \"will no longer prosecute this matter.\"",
      "\"After an extensive review by current Department of Justice and Civil Rights Division leadership, the United States no longer believes that the proposed consent decree would be in the public interest,\" the filing, signed by Dhillon and others, reads.",
      "Consent decrees were used in federal investigations of law enforcement agencies during the Obama administration as part of a renewed commitment to civil rights issues and accountability in policing. But the Justice Department during the first Trump administration restricted their use. That policy was rescinded during the Biden administration. Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland subsequently opened the investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department.",
      "Dhillon, the assistant attorney general, told reporters that consent decrees often set \"unrealistic, idealistic expectations that are simply a recipe for non-compliance and perpetual consent decree hell for jurisdictions.\" But she said if there was a \"case of widespread, systemic racist or otherwise excessive-force situations happening despite training, despite litigation, despite local law enforcement taking these issues on,\" consent decrees \"might be an appropriate vehicle.\"",
      "\"Theoretically, we are not ruling it out,\" she added.",
      "The yearslong examination by the Justice Department into the Minneapolis Police Department was launched in 2021, in the wake of Floyd's death, and found that the Minneapolis Police Department disproportionately targeted Black and Native American people in law enforcement activity and used unjustified force in many instances.",
      "The probe was undertaken to determine whether the department engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of unconstitutional or unlawful policing. That civil investigation was separate from a federal criminal probe into Floyd's death, which led to convictions of three Minneapolis police officers who were found to have failed to step in to stop Chauvin's use of force against Floyd.",
      "Investigators had recommended nearly 30 remedial measures and improvements for Minneapolis to implement to combat racial disparities and excessive use of force by the department, such as enhanced training and accountability measures, and improved data collection of police activity.",
      "The city of Minneapolis and the Justice Department had entered into an agreement in principle to reach a court-authorized consent decree, which would have formalized the federal findings and recommendations, and appointed an independent monitor for the police department.",
      "The Minneapolis City Council and Mayor Jacob Frey approved the terms of a court-enforceable consent decree in early January, which had to be approved by a federal judge before taking effect. The city has begun implementing the reforms laid out in the agreement and said it will continue to do so despite the Trump administration's decision to dismiss the consent decree case.",
      "\"We're doing it anyway,\" Frey said in a statement. \"We will implement every reform outlined in the consent decree\u2014because accountability isn't optional. Our independent monitor has lauded the meaningful progress we've made under the state settlement agreement, and the public can count on clear, measurable proof that our reforms are moving forward.\"",
      "As for the Louisville Police Department, the Justice Department's investigation found that it, too, likely engaged in a pattern of conduct that violated citizens' civil and constitutional rights. The Justice Department, city of Louisville and its police department reached an agreement in principle toward a consent decree.",
      "Four Louisville Metro Police Department officers faced federal charges in connection with Taylor's death in March 2020. Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot when officers stormed into her apartment while she was asleep with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend, who thought the officers were intruders, fired a handgun as they entered. The officers in response fired 22 shots into the apartment, and one struck Taylor in the chest.",
      "But in announcing the decision to dismiss the lawsuits against the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments, the Justice Department under President Trump claimed they accused the agencies of engaging in patterns of unconstitutional policing by \"wrongly equating statistical disparities with intentional discrimination and heavily relying on flawed methodologies and incomplete data.\"",
      "The Trump administration also said the consent decrees went too far and would have subjected the police departments to sweeping oversight.",
      "\"In short, these sweeping consent decrees would have imposed years of micromanagement of local police departments by federal courts and expensive independent monitors, and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of compliance costs, without a legally or factually adequate basis for doing so,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Dhillon said the agreements cost an average of $10 million a year and \"should be a rare exception and not the norm.\" She said \"specifics of policing, policy, hiring, training, management, promotion and internal policies are best made at a local level, where there's local accountability, and local control over funding and policy issues.\"",
      "Both Minneapolis and Louisville either already have consent decrees at the state level or are hiring their own monitors and taking actions on their own to ensure constitutional policing, Dhillon said, adding that the cities should save money thanks to the Justice Department's decision.",
      "\"You can actually use that money, tens of millions of dollars, to hire more cops for your communities that will keep you safer than a partner at a big law firm in D.C. getting paid to monitor you,\" Dhillon said.",

    "story": [
      "Differences between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa came to a head Wednesday afternoon in a tense exchange in the Oval Office, as Mr. Trump confronted him over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
      "Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa met for a critical conversation \u2014 with South African-born billionaire Elon Musk in the room \u2014 amid tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, after the U.S.\u00a0accepted\u00a059 White Afrikaners last week and granted them status as refugees.",
      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Ramaphosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans.",
      "The president said white crosses seen in the video showed burial sites of White farmers. In fact, they were part of a\u00a0protest, filmed near Normandien, South Africa, on Sept. 5, 2020, after the killing of Glen and Vida Rafferty, a White farming couple. Participants\u00a0said\u00a0the demonstration aimed to draw attention to all farm murders in the region, not solely those involving White farmers. Elon Musk previously shared the same video on X, posting it on\u00a0March 8\u00a0and\u00a0May 13\u00a0with the claim that the crosses represented White farmers.",
      "The video also included footage of a crowd at a rally being led in a chant against White farmers. After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Less than two weeks until the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season, Federal Emergency Management Agency acting Administrator David Richardson has rescinded the agency's strategic plan, a comprehensive policy document that outlines the disaster relief agency's priorities.",
      "In a short memo sent to FEMA employees on Wednesday and obtained by CBS News, Richardson wrote, \"The 2022-2026 FEMA Strategic Plan is hereby rescinded. The Strategic Plan contains goals and objectives that bear no connection to FEMA accomplishing its mission. This summer, a new 2026-2030 strategy will be developed. The strategy will tie directly to FEMA executing its Mission Essential Tasks.\"",
      "The memo authored by Richardson was brief \u2014 the new agency head now requires that all FEMA memos to, from or for his office be no longer than one page in length, according to multiple current FEMA employees.",
      "FEMA did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for comment.",
      "Wired was the first to report that the plan had been rescinded.",
      "One FEMA official described the strategic plan to CBS News as the agency's \"organizational backbone.\"",
      "\"Without it, there are just a bunch of offices doing whatever they feel like doing,\" the official said.",
      "The strategic plan, which was published in December 2021 under former administrator Deanne Criswell, was set to expire in 2026. The plan no longer appears on FEMA's website.",
      "Criswell, in a news release at the time the plan was published, laid out three main goals for the agency: \"Instill Equity as a Foundation of Emergency Management,\" \"Lead Whole of Community in Climate Resilience\" and \"Promote and Sustain a Ready FEMA and Prepared Nation.\"",
      "The official told CBS News Richardson is now trying to figure out how to operate FEMA so that it does nothing more or less than what the law requires. Part of that includes nixing the agency's Office of Resilience Strategy.",
      "\"That office exists to figure out how to maximize efficacy of publicly spent money on projects that build a resilient infrastructure that can withstand disaster events,\" the official said. \"Without that guiding star, FEMA will operate as triage instead of actually trying to mitigate future damage before it happens.\"",
      "The official compared the removal of the ORS to people relying solely on emergency rooms for health care rather than also getting preventative care.",
      "\"A primary care physician would've been able to tell you that you have a disease that makes your blood not clot properly. Pulling the Office of Resilience Strategy out of the equation means that you'll bleed out and die from a paper cut because nobody was around to tell you that your life was at risk in the first place,\" the said.",
      "The move to rescind the strategic plan comes a little over a week after an internal agency presentation featured a slide that noted, \"As FEMA transforms to a smaller footprint, the intent for this hurricane season is not well understood, thus FEMA is not ready.\"",

      "\"It is with immense sadness that we share that our devoted and loving father, husband, brother, friend, and public servant, Congressman Gerald E. Connolly, passed away peacefully at his home this morning surrounded by family,\" Connolly's family announced in a statement.",
      "Connolly, a Democrat, has represented Virginia's 11th Congressional District, which covers parts of the region outside of Washington, D.C., since 2009. He announced in November that he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and would be undergoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",
      "But the Virginia Democrat said in an open letter to his constituents last month that while the cancer was initially beaten back after treatments, it had returned. He said at the time that his \"sun is setting on my time in public service.\"",
      "In announcing his death, Connolly's family praised his years in public service, saying \"his legacy now colors our region.\"",
      "\"We were fortunate to share Gerry with Northern Virginia for nearly 40 years because that was his joy, his purpose, and his passion,\" they said. \"His absence will leave a hole in our hearts, but we are proud that his life's work will endure for future generations. We thank you for your love of Gerry, and know he loved you all so much.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden, who recently announced he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, said Connelly was a man of \"deep integrity, principle, and purpose.\"",
      "\"He was a dear friend, a fierce leader for working families, and someone I was proud to partner with throughout our careers,\" Biden wrote in a post on X. \"When I served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Gerry was a key member of our team for a decade starting in 1979. Later, he was elected to Congress himself, and when I was president, Gerry and I worked together to pass consequential legislation, including the American Rescue Plan and efforts to prevent veteran suicide and support our nation's first responders.\"",

      "\"I'm deeply saddened by the passing of Ranking Member Gerry Connolly. He was a dedicated public servant who represented Virginia's 11th Congressional District with honor and integrity,\" he said. \"We mourn the loss of our friend and colleague, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.\"",
      "Before he was elected to Congress, Connolly served for 14 years on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, including five years as its chairman. The county is the largest jurisdiction in the Washington, D.C., region, with more than 1 million residents. While in Congress, he served on the Oversight panel and the Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "House Democrats elected Connolly to serve as the ranking member of the Oversight Committee following the November elections. His decision last month to step down from the top position on the panel set off an internal race among Democrats to succeed him.",

It is deliberate violence, the calculated cruelty of a government that tears families apart without remorse.\"",
      "The ACLU said the refusal by ICE and the prison contractor GEO Group came after multiple requests from Khalil's legal team pointing to federal policies that encourage contact visits between children and their detained parents. Officials, they said, cited \"a blanket no-contact visitation policy at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center (CLIPC) and unspecified 'security concerns' relating to the presence of a mother and newborn baby in an unsecure part of the facility.\"",

      "A Georgia teen who was detained by federal deportation officers following local traffic charges that have since been dismissed was granted bond on Wednesday, paving the way for her to be released from immigration detention, her mother and attorney told CBS News.",
      "Ximena Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 4, has been in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody since earlier this month, when she was stopped by local police in Dalton, Georgia, over allegations that she had made an improper turn while driving.",
      "Arias Cristobal, 19, was charged with driving without a license and making an improper turn and booked into the county jail in Dalton, where she lives with her family. ICE then took custody of Arias Cristobal, who is in the U.S. illegally, at the county jail, which has an agreement to work with federal immigration authorities.",
      "She has been held at the Stewart ICE detention facility in Lumpkin, Georgia, since then. Initially, that facility was also housing her father, who had been taken into ICE custody in April, also after a traffic stop. But he was granted bond last week and released.",
      "Given her time in the U.S. and lack of a criminal record, local community members, including the Republican lawmaker representing Dalton in the Georgia legislature, expressed support for Arias Cristobal and called for her release. Community outrage intensified once Dalton authorities dismissed the traffic charges against Arias Cristobal after revealing she had been mistakenly stopped by the police officer who arrested her.",
      "Dustin Baxter, Arias Cristobal's immigration attorney, said an immigration judge on Wednesday granted his client a $1,500 bond, the lowest amount allowed by law.",
      "\"The judge had reviewed Ximena's case in detail and determined that Ximena is in fact not a flight risk or a danger to the community in the least,\" Baxter said. \"The Department of Homeland Security indicated that it would not appeal the judge's decision.\"",

The Department of Homeland Security has previously said she and her father should face \"consequences\" for being in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Under the Biden administration, it would've been unlikely for someone like Arias Cristobal \u2014 an undocumented immigrant without a criminal history who came to the U.S. as a young child \u2014 to be arrested by ICE.",
      "But as part of its sweeping immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has vastly broadened who ICE officers can target for arrest and deportation, revoking Biden-era policies that generally ensured the agency would only target serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals in the country illegally.",
      "Even though Arias Cristobal is an undocumented immigrant who came to the U.S. as a child \u2014 a group commonly known as \"Dreamers\" \u2014 she did not qualify for an Obama-era program that protects half a million of those individuals from deportation.",
      "That Obama administration policy, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, requires beneficiaries to have arrived in the U.S. before June 2007. Arias Cristobal came to the country in 2010. DACA has also been closed to new applicants due to federal litigation.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Defense Department said Wednesday it has accepted a Boeing jet from Qatar that will be retrofitted and used to transport President Trump.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth accepted the Boeing 747 \"in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.\"",
      "\"The Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the President of the United States,\" Parnell said.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the Pentagon had accepted the jetliner from the government of Qatar.",
      "\"As directed by the Secretary of Defense, the Air Force is preparing to award a contract to modify a Boeing 747 aircraft for executive airlift. Details related to the contract are classified,\" a spokesperson for the Air Force said in a statement.",
      "Hegseth's acceptance of the plane comes days after sources confirmed to CBS News that the Qatari royal family would be donating aircraft for Mr. Trump's use. The gift was first reported by ABC News. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet will be donated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library just before he leaves office.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters last week that the Qataris are \"giving us a gift\" and lamented that the current plane used for Air Force One is nearly four decades old. When the president is aboard either of the two Boeing aircrafts that are part of the presidential air transport fleet, its call sign is \"Air Force One,\" according to the Air Force.",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",
      "The president has continued to defend the notion of receiving the plane from Qatar, writing on social media that the Boeing jet is being given to the Defense Department, and is a gift that will be used as a \"temporary Air Force One\" until new Boeing planes arrive.",
      "\"Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a\u00a0 country that wants to reward us for a job well done. This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,\" he wrote last week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also reiterated Monday that the plane is a donation to the nation and the Air Force.",
      "\"The government of Qatar, Qatari family, has offered to donate this plane to the United States Air Force, where that donation will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations,\" she said. \"It will be retrofitted to the highest of standards by the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force. This plane is not a personal donation or a gift to the president of the United States.\"",
      "Still, news of the gift raised concerns among members of Congress and questions of whether the transaction complied with federal ethics rules.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York sent a letter last week to three internal government watchdogs asking them to conduct an ethics review of the gift and issue an advisory opinion on whether it violates federal ethics regulations and the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign nations.",
      "\"The American presidency is not a personal inheritance. It does not exist to enrich Donald Trump,\" he wrote. \"It belongs to 'We the People.' If we fail to draw the line here, there may soon be no line left to draw.\"",
      "Some Republicans, too, have expressed unease with the gift from the Qatari government. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that there are \"lots of issues associated with that offer,\" which he said should be discussed further.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said that while he understands the need for a new Air Force One, \"I'd love to have a big, beautiful jet that's built in the United States of America.\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina warned \"everybody needs to know that Air Force One is not like every other Boeing.\"",
      "\"It's going to have to be put through a lot of paces and probably every square inch analyzed before I think the president should consider it as a primary means of transportation,\" he said.",
      "The secretary of the Air Force, Troy Meink, who was only confirmed last week, told Congress on Tuesday that the Air Force had already started looking into what modifications would be required to retrofit the jet.",
      "\"The secretary of defense has directed the Air Force to basically start planning to modify the aircraft. We are postured to do that,\" Meink told Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who asked about the potential security concerns of such a transfer.",

    "summary": "A federal district judge ordered DOGE to turn over information to a government watchdog group that filed a FOIA request for its records.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to halt a lower court order that required the White House's Department of Government Efficiency to turn over information to a government watchdog group in a lawsuit that tests whether the task force is subject to the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "The request from Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose out of a public records request made by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington that sought information about DOGE, its operations and personnel. The watchdog group went on to file a federal lawsuit based on that FOIA request, and, as part of the suit, sought categories of information through the discovery process about DOGE's activities since President Trump took office.",
      "Among the information CREW is seeking is a deposition with Amy Gleason, who the White House has said is the acting administrator of DOGE; a list of federal contracts or grants that DOGE personnel recommended for cancellation; and the names of all current and former DOGE employees, as well as details of their employment and who oversees them.",
      "The district court granted most of CREW's request for information, including to depose Gleason. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper found that DOGE is likely subject to FOIA and said that the task force's actions demonstrate that it has \"substantial authority over vast swathes of the federal government.\"",
      "\"Canceling any government contract would seem to require substantial authority \u2014 and canceling them on this scale certainly does. Again, USDS reportedly is leading the charge on these actions, not merely advising others to carry them out,\" Cooper wrote in a March decision.",
      "He noted that DOGE likely has some independent authority to terminate federal employees, programs and contracts.",
      "\"Doing any of those three things would appear to require substantial independent authority; to do all three surely does,\" Cooper said.",
      "The Trump administration asked the federal appeals court in Washington to halt the order, which it agreed to do temporarily. Then, last week, a panel of judges on the appeals court lifted its stay, which clears the way for DOGE to hand over the documents sought by CREW. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that the discovery ordered by the district court is \"narrow\" and appropriate.",
      "DOGE now has until June 3 to turn over documents, and Gleason's deposition must be completed by June 13.",
      "The dispute over the efforts to learn more about DOGE, its work and employees turns on whether the task force is subject to FOIA, the federal law that allows members of the public to request access to records and information from federal agencies. FOIA does not apply to Congress, the federal courts and entities within the Executive Office of the President.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that DOGE is a presidential advisory body housed within the Executive Office of the President tasked with providing recommendations to Mr. Trump and federal agencies on policy matters that are important to the president's agenda. Sauer said that as a result of those functions, DOGE is exempt from FOIA.",
      "Sauer claimed that the district court's order requiring DOGE to hand over information through the discovery process to determine if it is covered by FOIA turns the public records law \"on its head\" and violates the separation of powers by subjecting it to \"intrusive discovery.\"",
      "He warned that if it is allowed to stand, several components of the White House like the offices of the chief of staff, national security adviser, and other advisers to the president would be subject to FOIA.",
      "\"That untenable result would compromise the provision of candid, confidential advice to the president and disrupt the inner workings of the Executive Branch,\" Sauer wrote. \"Yet, in the decisions below, the court of appeals and district court treated a presidential advisory body as a potential 'agency' based on the persuasive force of its recommendations \u2014 threatening opening season for FOIA requests on the president's advisors.\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE when he returned White House as part of an effort to shrink the size of the federal government. The president has repeatedly said that Elon Musk is the head of DOGE, though Justice Department lawyers have said in court filings that he is not an employee of the entity and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "Questions about Musk's role with DOGE eventually led the White House to declare Gleason as its acting administrator. Gleason worked as a senior adviser to the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE.",
      "Still, since its establishment, DOGE employees have fanned out across federal agencies to implement cost-cutting measures and were behind steep reductions in the federal workforce, as well as the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Many of DOGE's efforts, as well as Musk's role within the task force have been subject to legal challenges.",
      "The Supreme Court is currently weighing an emergency appeal involving DOGE's attempts to gain access to sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration and was asked to intervene in a legal battle over reductions in force at 21 agencies.",

    "summary": "Trump's plans to build a \"Golden Dome\" U.S. missile defense system undermine \"global strategic balance and stability,\" and should be abandoned, China says.",
    "story": [
      "China said Wednesday that the Trump administration's plan to construct a so-called \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the U.S. from missile attacks carries \"strong offensive implications\" and will increase the risks of a global arms race and militarizing outer space. President Trump said Tuesday that his administration had \"officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system,\" and that a budget package currently being deliberated by Congress would provide an initial $25 billion in funding for the project.",
      "An unclassified assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency shows the military expects to be contending with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" noting specifically that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "\"North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability,\" the DIA assessment said, warning that already, \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\"",
      "But China, which has been deepening its ties with Russia while rapidly developing its missile and other military capabilities, including its nuclear weapons, accused the Trump administration of obsessing over U.S. defense at the risk of endangering global security.",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself. This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Wednesday during a regular briefing in Beijing, according to multiple international news agencies.",
      "The White House plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield, fuels an arms race, and undermines international security,\" she said. \"We urge the United States to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has said for years that China and Russia are already deploying weapons in space, with reports suggesting everything from laser weapons to Chinese satellites with the ability to disable or even capture American satellites. Last year, the U.S. warned Russia against deploying a\u00a0nuclear-capable anti-satellite weapon that analysts believe could loiter in space for long periods of time before emitting a burst that would disable all satellites around it.",
      "In Russia's capital, meanwhile, the Kremlin said Wednesday that Mr. Trump's plans would require consultations between Moscow and Washington, but a spokesperson said it was largely a \"sovereign matter\" for the U.S.",
      "It was a softer stance than taken previously by the regime of President Vladimir Putin, which had recently published a statement saying the new American missile defense system would explicitly give Moscow an impetus \"for a significant strengthening of the arsenal for conducting combat operations in space.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, as he made his announcement, that he'd not yet spoken with Putin about his plans, but he said he would, \"at the right time.\"",
      "China and Russia, in a joint statement issued earlier in the month, called the Golden Dome project, \"deeply destabilizing in nature,\" and the two U.S. adversaries said it would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday announced his administration has selected the architectural design for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the United States from foreign threats.",
      "The president also said the budget package Republicans are currently ironing out on Capitol Hill will include an initial $25 billion to begin construction on the missile defense system. Mr. Trump said the project's total cost will be about $175 billion, although it could be much more. Congress hasn't yet funded any of the project, although Mr. Trump told reporters he thinks it'll be easy to fund on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies.",
      "Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can.",
      "\"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\"",
      "The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around.",
      "\"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\"",
      "The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In his March joint address to Congress, the president requested funding for the system.",
      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/noaa-hurricane-season-forecast-2025/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 11:45:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With the 2025 hurricane season starting June 1, NOAA forecasters are announcing their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ten days before start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have announced their forecast for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year. The current outlook predicts a 60% chance of an \"above-normal\" hurricane season, with between 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes, forecasters said.",
      "They estimated there's a 30% chance of a \"near-normal\" season and a 10% chance of a \"below-normal\" season.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, releases its seasonal hurricane outlook each spring. It incorporates research from the Climate Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, all branches of the agency.",
      "Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham presented the findings during a news conference Thursday morning at the Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center in Gretna, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans. They chose that location to commemorate the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, 20 years since that storm devastated the area.",
      "In their remarks, Grimm and Graham each emphasized the technological developments that have allowed NOAA and the weather service to produce forecasts that are more accurate with each passing year.",
      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning form current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral condition of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

    "story": [
      "A new study casts doubt on a phenomenon that was previously believed to show water flowing on the surface of Mars.",
      "Since the 1970s, scientists have studied dark streaks seen on Mars' cliff sides and crater walls. The streaks tend to be hundreds of meters long. Some can last for a long time, while others are more short-lived. Those more short-lived slope streaks, called recurring slope lineae, or RSLS, tend to recur in the same areas from year to year, according to a news release announcing the study.",
      "Some scientists believe the streaks are proof of flowing water on the planet and could suggest the Red Planet is home to habitable environments. Others believe the streaks are caused by dry processes, like rock falls or wind gusts, and said the streaks only appear like liquid remnants because scientists are studying orbital images.",
      "Adomas Valantinas, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, and Valentin Bickel, a researcher at Switzerland's University of Bern, used machine learning to study the streaks. The process cataloged more than 86,00 high-resolution satellite images of the slope streaks and RSLs. That created a first-of-its-kind global Martian map showing more than half a million such features.",
      "\"Once we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors.\" Bickel said. \"Then we could look for correlations over hundreds of thousands of cases to better understand the conditions under which these features form.\"",
      "The analysis, published in Nature on Monday, found that the slope streaks were not \"generally associated with factors that suggest a liquid or frost origin,\" according to the news release. Such factors would include a specific orientation of slopes, high humidity or surface temperature fluctuations.",
      "What the study did find was that the slopes were more likely to form in places that had above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, likely pointing to a dry origin. The slope streaks were more often found near recent-impact craters and could be caused when shockwaves shake surface dust. RSLs are more common in areas with frequent rockfalls or dust devils.",
      "\"Our study reviewed these features but found no evidence of water. Our model favors dry formation processes,\" Valantinas said.",
      "The results of the study cast doubt on claims that slope streaks could be signs of habitable regions. That means that researchers could send rovers or other spacecraft to explore the areas without contaminating the sites.",
      "\"That's the advantage of this big data approach,\" Valantinas said. \"It helps us to rule out some hypotheses from orbit before we send spacecraft to explore.\"",

    "summary": "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
    "story": [
      "Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023. Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place \u2014 with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Last week, Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly's Education Committee, called phones \"a cancer on our kids\" that are \"driving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\"",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\"This is a not just an academic bill,\" Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \"This is a mental health bill. It's a public safety bill.\"",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "Teachers and administrators have long known cellphones were major distractions in learning: A\u00a02023 Pew survey showed 72%\u00a0 of high school teachers\u00a0view cellphones as a major problem in their classrooms. And U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has\u00a0issued an advisory\u00a0on the effects of social media on youth mental health.",
      "Aside from academic benefits, cellphone restrictions can assist with social development and creating community at the school, Kim Whitman a parent-turned-advocate told CBS News last year. Whitman, a co-founder of Phone Free, said if schools \"allow phones to be present it's hard for students to connect and create a sense of belonging.\"",
      "More focus on bans throughout school day",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \"a huge win.\"",
      "\"Teachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \"bell-to-bell\" bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group's political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\"That's often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\" Hoffman said.",
      "Some states want districts to set rules",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "Opposition from some parents, students",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\"It was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\"It is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\" Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "Most states provide no funding for laws",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",

      "Rodriguez allegedly shot and killed the victims \u2014 a couple about to become engaged, according to Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the U.S. \u2014 as they were leaving the museum, which is located in the heart of the U.S. capital. According to police and video from the scene, he shouted \"free, free Palestine\" as he was being taken into custody.",

      "The suspect had been seen \"pacing back and forth outside of the museum\" before he approached a group of four people, \"produced a handgun\" and fatally shot the two victims, Smith said at a news conference. He entered the museum right after the shooting and museum security arrested him, according to Smith.",
      "\"The suspect identified where he discarded the weapon, and that weapon has been recovered,\" Smith said, adding that he \"implied that he committed the offense.\"",

He asked, 'Do you think that's why they did this attack' \u2026 referring to the rounds that we heard.\"",
      "She said she told him she didn't think so and asked if he was OK. Then, she said, \"He reaches into his bag and pulls out a keffiyeh and says, 'I did it. I did it for Gaza.' And, just starts shouting, 'Free Palestine.'\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4, blocking the attempt to establish the nation's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An evenly divided Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a lower court decision that invalidated a contract approved by the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board that established the nation's first religious charter school, blocking the effort in a closely watched case that posed a test for the separation of church and state.",
      "The high court split 4-4, which leaves in place the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate in the case. The high court issued a one line, unsigned decision stating \"the judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court.\"",
      "Argued at the end of April, the legal fight could have opened the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools. But following the arguments, it appeared that the outcome of the case would hinge on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program. The issue of whether religious institutions must be permitted to participate in state charter school systems is likely to land before the Supreme Court again in a case likely to involve all nine justices.",
      "The legal battle over the attempt to create St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma came on the heels of a trio of recent rulings in which the Supreme Court sided with religious families and institutions challenging state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violating the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause.",
      "In 2017, the high court ruled that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court said that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said\u00a0Maine cannot limit\u00a0a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Nicole Stelle Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who authored a\u00a0paper\u00a0that suggested states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause, said she was disappointed with the decision but noted that it does not set precedent.",
      "\"The question whether barring religious charter schools violates the Constitution remains live, and I remain confident that the Court will eventually rule that it does,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Garnett is friends with Barrett, who also taught at Notre Dame Law School before she became a judge. The university's Religious Liberty Clinic represented St. Isidore.",
      "A decision in favor of the school could have led to the country's first religious charter school. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican who argued against establishment of the school, had warned that a decision allowing its contract to stand would upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a\u00a02023 report\u00a0from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation,\u00a0according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond\u00a0warned\u00a0against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an\u00a0earlier analysis\u00a0from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "Oklahoma's charter school board and St. Isidore's appealed the state court ruling to the Supreme Court, and it said in January it would review that decision.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 12:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The \"Make America Healthy Again\" report outlines what it says are four leading drivers of childhood disease, but it is facing criticism from some health officials.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's \"Make America Healthy Again\" or \"MAHA\" commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has published its first report on what it says are four leading drivers of childhood chronic disease.",
      "\"The report is the product of a consensual process, and it represents a collaborative effort of all the agencies and the White House. And it represents a consensus that is probably the strongest and most radical consensus by a government agency in history about the state of America's health,\" Kennedy told reporters in a call ahead of its release.",
      "Thursday's release is the first in a process laid out by President Trump's executive order in February. By August, the commission is due to follow up with a policy strategy to address the findings raised in this report.",
      "The \"chronic disease crisis\" in children is described in the report as growing rates of a number of issues including childhood obesity, diabetes, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, cancer, allergies and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that the Trump administration was not seeking \"a European, mandate-driven regulatory system that stifles growth\" as a result of the process.",
      "\"It will happen through a renewed focus on improved science throughout the federal government and our partners. And through unleashing private sector innovation to produce better solutions for our children,\" Zeldin said.",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials criticized the report, which they said misrepresented several facts and left out other well-known drivers of childhood chronic disease.",
      "\"They're looking for specific causes and silver bullets to draw attention to. However, prevention is all about making it easier for people to make healthy choices,\" said one current federal health official in a message, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "What does the MAHA report say is causing childhood chronic disease?",
      "The wide-ranging report is organized around four topics that it describes as the \"potential drivers behind the rise in childhood chronic disease that present the clearest opportunities for progress\":",
      "Poor diet, driven primarily by ultra-processed foods",
      "Cumulative exposure to chemicals like food additives and pesticides",
      "Lack of physical activity and chronic stress",
      "\"Overmedicalization\" with too many prescriptions and vaccines",
      "These largely reflect many of the themes that Kennedy has long spoken about, including as a longshot presidential candidate last year and as the head of the nation's public health agencies in recent months.",
      "\"It is very strong, it's very frank, and it is a clarion call to do something with utmost urgency to end this crisis. And that's what we wanted,\" Kennedy said of the report.",
      "For example, under the heading of ultra-processed foods, the report echoes Kennedy's criticism of the shift from using \"minimally processed animal-based sources like butter and lard\" to seed oils like corn and canola. And it takes aim at the federal dietary guidelines process, which is due to release a major update later this year.",
      "Others reflect past Kennedy priorities that stop short of his previous calls. For example, the report criticizes the \"corporate capture of media\" through advertising campaigns paid for by drugmakers, but does not call for a ban as he did in the past, acknowledging the pharmaceutical industry \"has the First Amendment right to have these\" ads.",
      "Some parts of the report mirror public health advice championed under the Biden administration, like around the \"epidemic of loneliness and isolation,\" which then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned in 2023 was driven by factors like social media and technology.",
      "It also often points to other countries as examples of how things could be done better. A section criticizing U.S. school nutrition programs cites examples from France, Japan and Nordic countries that prepare meals using healthier ingredients.",
      "What does the MAHA report say about pesticides?",
      "The report warns that no \"country in the world has fully accounted for the fact that children are often exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals,\" saying that evaluations of chemicals individually may be neglecting the \"cumulative burdens\" of multiple exposures.",
      "Pesticides are named as a potential risk to be studied alongside a list that includes PFAS, microplastics, fluoride, electromagnetic radiation and chemicals used to make plastics.",
      "\"For example, a selection of research studies on a herbicide (glyphosate) have noted a range of possible health effects, ranging from reproductive and developmental disorders as well as cancers, liver inflammation and metabolic disturbances,\" the report says.",
      "Kennedy has previously spoken out vocally against glyphosate, dating back to court battles with the manufacturer of the Roundup pesticide made from the chemical. That had worried some Republicans and the agriculture industry ahead of the report's release.",
      "The report says that an updated government assessment of common herbicides will be released in 2026 and criticizes pesticide manufacturers for having \"spent billions on research initiatives\" that may have biased studies on the topic.",
      "But the report also pledges to support U.S. farmers, acknowledging that \"precipitous changes in agriculture practices could have an adverse impact\" on the food supply and says that past federal reviews of herbicides \"did not establish a direct link\" to bad health outcomes.",
      "\"We know that the American food system is the safest in the world. It is the safest, most reliable, most robust in the world. But now we talk about how to make it even better and healthier,\" said Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.",
      "What does the MAHA report say about vaccines and medications?",
      "The report lists a number of medications that it says raise \"important questions\" about its long-term impact for use on children. The list includes antidepressants, stimulant medications for ADHD, weight loss drugs, antibiotics and acid suppressants.",
      "\"Increasingly common, these popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs with complicated metabolic effects lack neurodevelopmental and other long term safety data, raising the specter of unforeseen problems that interrupt, damage, or impair metabolism and growth development,\" the report says of GLP-1 agonist medications.",
      "It calls out the \"growth of the childhood vaccine schedule,\" which Kennedy has long denounced, often with misleading claims about how vaccines were not sufficiently vetted for safety and efficacy.",
      "\"The number of vaccinations on the American vaccine schedule exceeds the number of vaccinations on many European schedules, including Denmark, which has nearly half as many,\" the report says.",
      "The report also reiterates Kennedy's criticism of the CDC's vaccine safety monitoring efforts, like in the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System and Vaccine Safety Datalink, as well as the federal approach to compensating childhood vaccine injury.",
      "It also criticizes groups like the American Medical Association for efforts to address disinformation about vaccines, saying it \"undermines the open dialogue essential to protecting and improving children's health.\"",
      "Kennedy's approach to vaccines has put him at odds with groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, which has urged him to do more to foster confidence in the \"rigorous safety system\" for vaccines needed to protect children.",
      "\"FDA and the CDC work together to ensure that years of vaccine clinical trials and safety studies are exhaustively examined, with rigorous, respected, and accepted scientific evidence,\" the group said in a letter in March.",
      "What does the MAHA report get wrong?",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials raised a number of issues with the report, which they said misstated several facts and left out several already well-documented drivers known to be causing chronic disease in children that health authorities are already working to address.",
      "Those efforts, they warned, such as work to avert lead poisoning in children, are now under-resourced in the wake of massive layoffs and further proposed budget cuts.",
      "\"This document makes it seem like we don't know what makes people sick,\" one federal health official said in a message, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Two officials pointed out maternal health and preterm birth was left out of the report, which is known to lead to a number of health problems and can be prevented through steps like quitting smoking, avoiding alcohol and getting early prenatal care. Smoking, and the need for broader efforts to prevent youth use of nicotine products, was also not mentioned in the report.",
      "Multiple officials said that scientific research and federal data had been selectively misrepresented in the report.",
      "One official pointed out that what the report highlights as a dramatic rise in childhood cancer ignores improvements in early diagnosis driving the higher rates, as well as declines in deaths.",
      "Another section of the report criticizes the federal dietary guidelines for focusing on limiting sodium instead of focusing on minimizing ultra-processed foods, which a former top FDA official said was \"very puzzling.\"",
      "\"Reducing sodium in the diet is likely the most impactful step they could take to reduce chronic disease risk, and they ignore the totality of the science, including large randomized trials of salt interventions and salt substitutes, that demonstrate important reductions in chronic diseases,\" Dr. Susan Mayne, the FDA's former top nutrition official, said in an email.",

    "summary": "With the 2025 hurricane season starting June 1, NOAA forecasters are announcing their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ten days before start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have announced their forecast for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year. The current outlook predicts a 60% chance of an \"above-normal\" hurricane season, with between 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes, forecasters said.",
      "They estimated there's a 30% chance of a \"near-normal\" season and a 10% chance of a \"below-normal\" season.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, releases its seasonal hurricane outlook each spring. It incorporates research from the Climate Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, all branches of the agency.",
      "Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham presented the findings during a news conference Thursday morning at the Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center in Gretna, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans. They chose that location to commemorate the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, 20 years since that storm devastated the area.",
      "In their remarks, Grimm and Graham each emphasized the technological developments that have allowed NOAA and the weather service to produce forecasts that are more accurate with each passing year.",
      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning form current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral condition of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

    "summary": "President Trump's missile defense project, called the \"Golden Dome for America,\" could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's missile defense project, called the \"Golden Dome for America,\" aims to protect the U.S. from foreign threats. But it has a steep price and has been criticized by China as threatening to increase the risks of militarizing space and a global arms race.",
      "The president on Tuesday said his administration had \"selected an architecture\" for the \"state-of-the-art system,\" which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars and put U.S. weapons in space for the first time in history.",
      "What is the Golden Dome and how will it work?",
      "The Golden Dome is a multilayered defense system that the president, speaking in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said will deploy \"next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors.\"",
      "\"The Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" the president said, adding that he wants it to be operational before his term ends.",
      "The concept includes both ground- and space-based capabilities that would defend against missiles by: detecting and destroying them ahead of launch, intercepting them early in flight, halting them midcourse and stopping them in the last few moments of approaching a target.",
      "The initiative would have multiple layers that expand on what the U.S. already has and build new programs to counter the full range of aerial threats, according to Gen. Gregory Guillot, the head of U.S. Northern Command, who testified in front of Congress in April.",
      "He described a domain awareness layer to track threats and then two other layers: \"the first being an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) defeat layer, which largely exists today with the GBIs (ground-based interceptors) that can defeat a North Korean threat and then an air layer that would defeat cruise missiles and air threats.\"",
      "\"The time to intercept a missile is when it launches,\" retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, a CBS News contributor and former commander of the U.S. Central Command, said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" Thursday. He said that early in a missile's flight, it is on \"a highly predictable\" path, can't maneuver and can't deploy systems to spoof radars, making that the ideal time to disable it.",
      "\"And to do that, you really have to go into space. You have to have a space-based system to do that,\" McKenzie said. \"That's very possible. We've looked at this at different times.\"",
      "McKenzie added he hopes \"that's where our thinking and our science is going to take us.\"",
      "\"This is not going to be off the cuff,\" Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS News in an interview.",
      "\"This is going to be well-rooted in the systems engineering and the understanding of the threat and in the overall architecture plans that have been in the works for a long time,\" Karako said.",
      "How much will the Golden Dome cost?",
      "The new initiative, which will encompass many programs, will be built in states including Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Alaska, according to Mr. Trump, and involve multiple American defense and technology companies that have not yet been selected.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a cost of $542 billion for the space-based components alone.",
      "\"The cost is certainly a daunting thing,\" McKenzie said. \"But on the other hand, the ability to defend the United States against a nuclear attack, not necessarily a massive Russian attack, but, you know, an attack from North Korea, an attack from Iran, a potential attack from a country like Pakistan, who's working to develop an ICBM. Those are all things that I think are feasible, and I think certainly are worth the cost that would be necessary to work the system.\"",
      "Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, which said on X it is ready to support the dome mission, describes it as a \"revolutionary concept.\"",
      "\"This is a Manhattan Project-scale mission, one that is both urgent and crucial to America's security,\" the company says.",
      "Lockheed Martin COO Frank St. John said it would protect against nuclear missiles, as well as intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles, and other threats.",
      "Mr. Trump said U.S. Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein would be responsible for overseeing the dome's progress.",
      "However, there is no funding yet to match the plan, which is \"still in the conceptual stage,\" Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told senators on Tuesday at a hearing. The Pentagon is also still developing the requirements that the dome will have to meet, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Israel's Iron Dome",
      "The Golden Dome idea first came to public light during Mr. Trump's joint address to Congress in March, when he asked for funding for it. He said, \"Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it, too.\"",
      "The president was referring to Israel's Iron Dome, which at least partially inspired the Golden Dome concept. Israel's system, installed in 2011 to defend against incoming projectiles, largely addresses shorter-range threats like rockets, while two other air defense systems work to defend against missiles.",
      "The Iron Dome, developed with U.S. backing, has intercepted thousands of rockets and has a success rate topping 90%, according to Israel.",
      "China responds",
      "Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said her country urges the U.S. \"to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself,\" she said at a Wednesday briefing in Beijing, according to news agencies. \"This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this.\"",
      "She also said the Golden Dome plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield\" and \"fuels an arms race.\"",
      "\"It's kind of humorous that the Chinese would talk about militarizing space, since I would guess they've done more work on militarizing space than any other nation in the world,\" McKenzie said. \"I would argue this is an inherently defensive system, and it's designed to protect the United States from attack.\"",
      "A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment shows that the U.S. military expects, over the coming decade, to contend with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication.\" It also said that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "China has been rapidly developing missile and other military capabilities, while deepening ties with Russia. The two nations said in a statement earlier this month that the dome project was \"deeply destabilizing in nature\" and would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",
      "Karako said that the Golden Dome initiative is \"a belated realignment of U.S. missile defense policy\" to counter both China and Russia, countries that the last two administrations in their national defense strategies have pointed to as strategic competitors.",
      "\"Could [the Golden Dome] launch another spiral of offensive developments to try to break through?\" McKenzie said. \"Certainly that's possible. And I recognize that's a possibility. Having said that, I still think it's an objective worth pursuing.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 10:11:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Seniors are unlikely to get a break on paying taxes on their Social Security benefits, an issue that impacts more people each year.",
    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation approved Thursday morning by House lawmakers includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in President Trump's domestic policy bill that passed early Thursday following a dramatic all-night session.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition. The proposed legislation, which spans more than 1,000 pages and includes a 42-page amendment with last-minute changes, would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "\"Enhanced deduction for seniors\"",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "But the new deduction for seniors is a limited-time break: It would be effective starting in the current 2025 tax year, but expire starting in the 2029 tax year, according to the legislation.",
      "The tax break also has an income threshold, with the full $4,000 deduction available to single filers who earn $75,000 or less and for married couples with annual incomes below $150,000. The deduction would be phased out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio opposed the bill. House Freedom Caucus chairman Andy Harris of Maryland voted present.",

      "The New York Democrat, alluding to the midterm elections next year, warned that \"this day might very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.\"",
      "The vote came after right-wing holdouts met Wednesday afternoon with Mr. Trump and Johnson at the White House. After the meeting, Johnson huddled with other members of the Republican conference to brief them on the changes while House Freedom Caucus members met separately.",
      "Before the White House meeting Wednesday, Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he wasn't optimistic the bill could pass this week, though he was \"pretty confident\" it could be passed within 10 days.",
      "But other budget hardliners said after the meeting that negotiations were headed in the right direction.",
      "During a visit to the Capitol Tuesday, Mr. Trump pressured Republicans to fall in line behind the legislation \u2014 which House GOP leaders have named \"The Big, Beautiful Bill\" \u2014 and suggested that those who don't could face primary challenges.",
      "In a statement of administrative policy issued Wednesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget urged House Republicans to pass the measure, saying it \"reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration,\" adding, \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "The details of the updated version of the legislation came together in the final hours before the vote.",
      "Johnson also negotiated with Republicans from blue states over a provision on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The moderates advocated for an increase to the SALT cap, currently set at $10,000, but argued that the $30,000 cap outlined in the package remained too low. An agreement was reached to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, according to the managers amendment.",
      "The vote marks a key victory for Johnson, after days of shepherding his conference through difficult disagreement over the legislation. But even with the victory, the legislation is expected to face resistance in the Senate \u2014 where numerous Republicans have said they'll seek changes to the bill.",
      "Johnson met with Senate Republicans to discuss the budget process Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the speaker would \"like to see as little change to the product as possible, because they cobble together a very delicate balance over there.\" But Thune said \"the Senate will have its imprint on it.\"",

    "summary": "Jim Irsay, the owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts, died Wednesday at the age of 65, the team said in a statement.",
    "story": [
      "Jim Irsay, the owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts, died on Wednesday, the team said in a statement. He was 65.",
      "\"Jim's dedication to and passion for the Indianapolis Colts in addition to his generosity, commitment to the community, and most importantly, his love for his family were unsurpassed,\" the team said.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately given, but the team said Irsay died \"peacefully in his sleep\" on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Irsay, the son of former Baltimore Colts owner Robert Irsay, spent much of his young life around the team, including serving as a ball boy during games.",
      "\"Some of Jim's fondest memories came from his youth working training camps in Baltimore and growing relationships with players, coaches, and staff whom he considered his extended family,\" the Colts said. \"He worked in every department before he was named the youngest general manager in team history in 1984 when the Colts arrived in Indianapolis.\"",
      "That move from Baltimore to Indianapolis, carried out suddenly by Robert Irsay in March 1984 to avoid having the team be seized by the city of Baltimore, would remain a lingering sore spot for former fans in Maryland.",
      "\"Jim's love and appreciation for the NFL in addition to its history, tradition, and principles influenced him to become a steward of the game throughout his 50-plus years in the League,\" the team said.",
      "Jim Irsay took over sole ownership of the team after his father's death in 1997. Under his leadership, the team drafted Peyton Manning No. 1 overall in 1998. Widely considered one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play the game, he helped deliver the Indianapolis Colts their first and thus far only Super Bowl title in 2006.",
      "\"I am heartbroken to hear about Jim Irsay's passing,\" Manning wrote on Instagram Wednesday. \"He was an incredibly generous and passionate owner and I will always be indebted to him for giving me my start in the NFL. His love for the Colts and the city of Indy was unmatched. His impact on the players who played for him will not be forgotten.\"",
      "Irsay was arrested in 2014 on suspicion of driving under the influence, with police saying he had several bottles of prescription medication on him at the time. Prosecutors alleged at the time he had tested positive for multiple opioids. He would eventually plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of\u00a0operating a vehicle while intoxicated. He was subsequently suspended by the NFL for six games and fined $500,000.",
      "Irsay had recently been in a wheelchair following two separate surgeries. One was to fix an issue that affected his left leg, quadriceps and back that stemmed from a fall in his bathroom that impacted his nerves, leading to lingering numbness, CBS affiliate WTTV reported. He then had surgery in mid-May to take care of a serious hematoma, according to WTTV.",
      "Irsay did not speak to reporters during the recent NFL Draft as he usually did.",
      "His story is one of a kind. As a teenager, he tossed footballs with MVP quarterbacks Johnny Unitas and Bert Jones. He relied frequently on the lessons he learned from rubbing elbows with some of the game's most important owners \u2014 Al Davis, Lamar Hunt, Wellington Mara and Art Rooney \u2014 as they worked through the 1982 players' strike and the implementation of a salary cap.",
      "And he presided over the greatest quarter-century of Colts football thanks to Manning, quarterback Andrew Luck, Hall of Fame general manager Bill Polian and Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy.",
      "Irsay handled everything from ticket sales to public relations as he rose through the organization even watching No. 1 overall pick John Elway force a trade to Denver in 1983.",
      "When he took over as owner following his father's death in 1997, things were different. The arrival of Manning helped Irsay \u2014 and the Colts \u2014 create a passionate local following that hadn't previously existed but still remains strong today.",
      "It wasn't always easy, either. When a 55% inheritance tax threatened his hold on the team, the younger Irsay found enough cash to keep the family business. And when his most prominent players were about to cash in during free agency, Irsay often ponied up top dollar to keep them.",
      "But football was only part of Irsay's story.",
      "He spent millions buying the original manuscripts to Jack Kerouac's generation-defining novel \"On The Road\" and Alcoholics Anonymous' \"Big Book\" and routinely made them available to the public.",
      "His ever-expanding musical collection included instruments and items from The Beatles, James Brown, Prince, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Elton John, Johnny Cash and Jerry Garcia; signed Presidential documents; an original \"wanted\" poster for John Wilkes Booth; a 1953 Jackie Robinson bat; Muhammad Ali's title belt from the 1974 \"Rumble in the Jungle;\" even the saddle from Secretariat's triple crown wins.",
      "Irsay also befriended singers such as Stephen Stills and John Mellencamp, took inspiration from the lyrics of Bob Dylan and revered the writings of Hunter S. Thompson, the self-described \"Gonzo journalist.\"",
      "\"It's a lot of fun to have these pieces, and guitars are always kind of the most interesting, in some ways, because you can play them, unlike a book, a manuscript or a painting,\" Irsay said during the summer of 2016. \"You can play them, and they can become four-dimensional.\"",
      "But Irsay also had his struggles.",
      "He was a recovering alcoholic and his professional successes couldn't insulate him from a constant battle with painkillers. In a November 2023 interview with HBO Sports, he acknowledged he had been to rehab at least 15 times and once accidentally overdosed.",
      "The low point may have come in March 2014 when he was arrested near his home in Carmel while driving erratically. When officers searched the car, they found nearly $30,000 in cash and numerous bottles of prescription pills. Five and a half months later, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Irsay for six games and fined him $500,000.",
      "Irsay described the absence as heartbreaking.",
      "\"I couldn't even imagine how hard that was,\" former Colts punter and now talk-show host Pat McAfee said after the suspension ended. \"You're talking about a guy who's been around the Colts his entire life, who personifies the Horseshoe.\"",
      "Still, he was wise enough to allow Polian almost free rein to construct a team that won a then-record number of regular-season games in a decade (115).",
      "Aside from the images of Irsay wearing a tie wrapped around his forehead on a magazine cover, tossing footballs in a suit, or his utterances on Twitter, he was a shrewd businessman with a big heart.",
      "When the Colts won the Super Bowl, he even sent a ring to two-time rushing champ Edgerrin James, who had left in free agency before the championship season.",
      "\"The guy grew up with this team,\" then-coach Chuck Pagano said in January 2015. \"He's got so much insight and so much knowledge. He's a football man through and through. It runs through his veins and he's got so much wisdom to share with all of us. He makes a huge impact.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Southern California police officer was caught partying at the Stagecoach Music Festival while collecting more than $600,000 in workers' compensation for a head injury that prosecutors allege was faked.",
      "Westminster officer Nicole Brown, 39, was charged Monday with 15 felonies of workers' compensation and insurance fraud, the Orange County District Attorney's office said in a news release. She faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted.",
      "Brown was on the job March 21, 2022, when she received a \"minor abrasion\" to her forehead while trying to arrest an uncooperative suspect, according to prosecutors. She told her watch commander that she had a headache and was feeling dizzy.",
      "Though an emergency room doctor who examined her that day released her back to work without restrictions, she called out sick for several days and was diagnosed with a severe concussion about a week after the initial injury. She was placed on Total Temporary Disability, which made her eligible to receive her full salary for up to a year and two-thirds of her salary after that.",
      "Later, investigators would find out that during the three days she called out sick after her injury, Brown went to several soccer conferences in San Diego. In the following year while collecting disability, she also ran in two 5K races, went snowboarding or skiing in Big Bear and Mammoth, attended baseball games, played golf, went to Disneyland and took online courses with a local university, prosecutors allege.",
      "\"Mrs. Brown suffered a significant head injury when she was on duty,\" her attorney Brian Gurwitz said, \"and she intends to vigorously fight these allegations.\"",
      "According to prosecutors, \"Brown's ongoing complaints were headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light and noise, problems processing thoughts and words, and an inability to work on the computer or do any screentime.\"",
      "The district attorney's office began their investigation into potential fraud after she was seen by several people \"dancing and drinking\" in April 2023 at the Stagecoach Music Festival, an annual country music festival held in the Coachella Valley with \"loud music and bright lights everywhere.\" This was reported to the Westminster Police Department.",
      "Three days after the festival, Brown and her stepfather attended a Zoom meeting where she sat in a dark room and said she was unable to look at the screen. Her stepfather said she still could not do paperwork or take phone calls. After the meeting, she was admitted to an inpatient center for traumatic brain injury.",
      "Prosecutors say Brown collected more than $600,000 from the city of Westminster, which includes her full salary and medical expenses.",
      "Her stepfather Peter Schuman, 57, of Buena Park, has also been charged with two felonies related to insurance fraud and helping commit a crime. He is a licensed attorney in California and faces discipline from the state bar, prosecutors said. Schuman does not have an attorney listed and could not be reached for comment.",
      "Brown was sworn into the Westminster Police Department in February 2019, according to Behind the Badge, a publication reporting on law enforcement news in California.",
      "Kimberly Edds, the public information officer for the Orange County District Attorney's Office, told ABC that Brown was also pursuing an online master's degree in organizational leadership.",
      "\"For a police officer to engage in that kind of behavior, it's absolutely disgusting,\" Edds told ABC.",
      "In 2021, the Westminster Police Department shared a post on social media featuring Brown to mark Women's History Month. The department said Brown's advice to women and young girls was: \"Reflect, accept and learn from all situations. A person's differences can be utilized to accomplish tasks and challenges that at one time seemed impossible.\"",

    "summary": "Federal judge strikes down government regulations requiring most U.S. employers to accommodate workers for abortions.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December 2022.",
      "The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers.",
      "Joseph, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \"It would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\"",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of a rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",
      "Bipartisan support for pregnant workers law",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women's right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.",
      "The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \"related medical condition\" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",
      "\"Victory! A federal court has granted Louisiana's request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees' purely elective abortions. This is a win for Louisiana and for life!\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.",
      "A Better Balance, the advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling.",
      "\"This court's decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,\" A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement.",
      "EEOC adrift",
      "Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.",
      "President Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. The president tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who voted against the regulations because of the abortion provision, has said she will work to change them.",
      "Similar lawsuits challenging the abortion provision are underway, including one filed by 17 states, led by Tennessee and Arkansas. In February, an appeals court ruled that lawsuit could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department had defended the EEOC against those lawsuits but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so under the Trump administration. The Justice Department did not reply to request for comment on Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Chettiar said the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the ruling, adding to its significance.",
      "\"The impact of this is huge,\" Chettiar said in an interview with The Associated Press, calling the decision \"symbolic and a big signal of where the right is when it comes to the rights of women.\"",
      "However, the Trump administration has continued defend the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act itself in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas that seeks to overturn the law in its entirety.",

Her degrees focused on international studies and policy, Robert Milgrim said.

    "summary": "North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un said a new naval destroyer was damaged in a \"serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness.\"",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vented fury at his own military and other officials Wednesday after his country's second naval destroyer was damaged in a failed launch that he was there to witness, state media reported Thursday. Kim wants bigger warships to deal with what he calls escalating U.S.-led threats against his country, amid a long-simmering standoff over his nuclear weapons.",
      "It is uncommon for North Korea to acknowledge military-related setbacks or accidents, and observers say the disclosure of the failed ship launch suggests Kim is serious about his naval advancement program and confident of ultimately achieving that objective.",
      "During a launching event at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, the newly built 5,000-ton-class destroyer became unbalanced and was punctured in its bottom sections after a transport cradle on the stern section slid off first and became stuck, according to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. KCNA didn't provide details on what caused the problem, the severity of the damage or whether anyone was injured.",
      "According to KCNA, Kim, who was present at the ceremony, blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators for a \"serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism.\" Kim called for a ruling Workers' Party meeting slated for late June to address their \"irresponsible errors.\"",
      "\"It's a shameful thing. But the reason why North Korea disclosed the incident is it wants to show it's speeding up the modernization of its navy forces and expresses its confidence that it can eventually build\" a greater navy, said Moon Keun-sik, a navy expert who teaches at Seoul's Hanyang University.",
      "Moon suspected the incident likely happened because North Korean workers aren't yet familiar with such a large warship and were rushed to put it in the water.",
      "The damaged vessel was likely the same class as the country's first destroyer unveiled last month, which experts assessed as North Korea's largest and most advanced warship to date. Kim called the first vessel, named Choe Hyon \u2014 a famed Korean guerilla fighter during the Japanese colonial period \u2014 a significant asset for advancing his goal of expanding the military's operational range and nuclear strike capabilities.",
      "State media described that ship as designed to carry weapons systems including nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. Kim said the ship was expected to enter active duty early next year and later supervised test-firings of missiles from the warship.",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the damaged vessel was likely equipped with similar systems and remains toppled over in the sea. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC appeared to show the vessel rolled onto its side, positioned diagonally from the dock, with most of its hull submerged and draped in blue covers.",
      "Earlier commercial satellite images indicated that the country was building its second destroyer at a shipyard in Chongjin.",
      "Beyond Parallel, a website run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the satellite imagery of Chongjin's Hambuk shipyard on May 12 showed that a second vessel in the Choe Hyon-class of guided missile destroyers was under construction.",
      "A report by the North Korea-focused 38 North website assessed last week that the destroyer in Chongjin was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, a method that has been rarely used in North Korea. The report said the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo, in contrast, used a floating dry dock.",
      "South Korean officials and experts say the Choe Hyon destroyer was likely built with Russian assistance as the two countries' military partnerships are booming. North Korea has provided Russia's Vladimir Putin with equipment and even soldiers to aid in his ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine.",
      "While North Korea's naval forces are considered far inferior to those of its rivals, analysts say the destroyer with nuclear-capable missiles and an advanced radar system would still enhance the North's offensive and defensive capabilities.",
      "Kim has framed the arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the United States and South Korea, which have been expanding joint military exercises in response to the North's advancing nuclear program. In April, the U.S. military flew long-range B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula in joint exercise with the South, in a show of force against North Korea days after Kim's powerful sister vowed to resist a U.S.-led push to eliminate the Pyongyang's nuclear program",
      "He says the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening the North Korean navy.",
      "Hours after releasing the report on the damaged destroyer, North Korea test-fired multiple cruise missiles from an area about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Chongjin, according to South Korea's military. The launches were a continuation of a streak of weapons-testing activities by North Korea in recent years. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the launches were being analyzed by South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities.",

      "The Palestinian Authority, which partially administers the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory, accused Israeli troops of \"deliberately\" shooting at the delegation near the flashpoint city of Jenin.

      "Britain's minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Hamish Falconer, said Wednesday that he'd spoken directly with U.K. diplomats affected by the incident, and he called for an investigation.",

      "\"The Japanese government has protested to the Israeli side and requested an explanation and the prevention of a recurrence,\" government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said in Tokyo, confirming that diplomatic staff from the country had taken part in the delegation.",
      "Israel-Europe ties increasingly strained over Gaza, D.C. murders",
      "The incident came as anger mounted over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Palestinians are scrambling for basic supplies after weeks of near-total isolation. A two-month Israeli aid blockade on Gaza was partially eased this week, but not enough to alleviate the hunger crisis facing the enclave's roughly 2 million inhabitants, according to the U.N. and humanitarian agencies.",

      "Refugee admissions to the United States have all but ground to a halt \u2014 except for one group, or a \"small subset,\" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them on Tuesday: Afrikaners. They are members of the White ethnic minority that once led South Africa's brutal, four-decade apartheid regime, which ended in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president.",
      "The Trump administration has already welcomed the first group of Afrikaner asylum applicants, who were given expedited refugee status after claiming they were the victims of violence and discrimination in South Africa.",
      "Other Afrikaners are waiting, keen to take advantage of the offer of special treatment from the Trump administration to gain protected status and the right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "Those hopefuls have been meeting to share information on the process, including Dolf Grobler, who has already applied. The professional hunter told CBS News he has $2.5 million to help make America great again.",
      "\"I'm worried that the genocide, which is currently mainly focused on White farmers, is going to spread,\" he said. The claim of a White genocide is one that President Trump's adviser Elon Musk, whose family are Afrikaners, has backed.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday as the U.S. leader hosted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa for an official visit. The Afrikaner refugee program was a topic of discussion, along with trade and other matters. In the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted.",
      "\"Those people in many cases, are being executed, being executed, and they happen to be White, and most happen to be farmers,\" Mr. Trump said, calling the situation \"sort of the opposite of apartheid.\"",
      "\"People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people,\" Ramaphosa said.",
      "According to South African police, in the last three months of 2024, 12 people were murdered on farms there; one was a White farmer, while the others were Black laborers or security workers.  Asked if he believed life for him and his family was better under apartheid \u2014 an overtly racist minority-rule system that denied equal rights to South Africa's vast majority Black population \u2014 Grobler didn't hesitate.",
      "\"Yes,\" he told CBS News. \"I can't say in my heart that we are better off now.\" Although he did concede apartheid was wrong.",
      "Claims of a White genocide are often circulated by right-wing groups, but the view is not held widely within the Afrikaner community.",
      "Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, an academic at North-West University in South Africa, says the claims are simply untrue.",
      "\"There's no sign of it, never has been. In fact, Whites are economically the strongest group\" in South Africa, Croucamp told CBS News. \"64% of all boardrooms in South Africa are still White. The average incomes of White South Africans are vastly higher than Black South Africans ... they have better schools, they have better education, private health care. This is the land of milk and honey if you're White.\"",
      "Croucamp suspects the South African government's strong stance against Israel's actions in Gaza, and its relations with China, could have played some part in Mr. Trump's decision to embrace the controversial amnesty program for Afrikaners, but he believes there's more to it.",
      "\"In South Africa, right-wing groups, so-called civil society groups, we know that they have access to the Trump administration because they claim that. And just over the last few days, they have, several times, they said that they will speak to the American government, as if they have access to them. And if you listen to what Trump has said, it corresponds exactly with the genocide narrative that they sell and that they market,\" Croucamp said. \"So, I'm afraid I have to believe them when they say they have direct access to the Trump administration, and we see what Trump has been doing.\"",
      "Grilled about the refugee program Tuesday on Capitol Hill, in a testy exchange with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Secretary of State Rubio insisted that U.S. foreign policy \"doesn't require even-handedness, it involves prioritizing the interests of the United States. ... The United States has a right to pick and choose who they allow into the United States.\"",
      "White South Africans make up only about 7% of the country's population, but they still own more than half of all its farmland. And while the country has a staggeringly high crime rate, racial motives are not generally a factor, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein.",
      "He acknowledged that violent attacks on farmers do occur, especially in agricultural land near big cities, where there are often large, impoverished populations, but he said overall, \"I feel safe. I sleep with my doors open here on the farm.\"",
      "There have also been allegations that White farmers are the victims of land expropriation, with the government seizing farms without providing compensation. In January, Ramaphosa signed into law measures to expropriate mostly unused land for public use,  which his government said was necessary to address the consequences of decades of apartheid. While the law provides for fair compensation in most cases, it also allows for expropriation without compensation under limited  circumstances. And any measures can be challenged in court.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that it unfairly targets White landowners, though the law does not mention the race of anyone who could be affected under the legislation.",
      "And more importantly, there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended.",
      "Serfontein argues the problem isn't a deliberate effort by the government to seize White-owned land without compensation, but rather \"because of a dysfunctional government. The model is wrong.\"",
      "He said that for decades, land has been handed over to a Black population with compensation for former owners under established rules, but without any support for the new owners. So, almost a decade ago, Serfontein helped to launch a project aimed at training new Black farmers to work the land.",
      "To date, he says he's personally helped train more than 700 young Black farmers \u2014 the country's next generation of agricultural workers.",
      "\"I'm extremely positive, and so are the young people, the young farmers, they are positive,\" he said.",

      "Serfontein said he didn't know the histories of the Afrikaners who had already left for the U.S., and he didn't doubt they \"probably had some unhappy experiences in South Africa, about a number of things. But let me tell you that if you went to NAMPO last week \u2014 NAMPO is the biggest agricultural show in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 you would have found a vibe there between the farmers, young farmers, old farmers, Black farmers, White farmers, that you've never experienced before.

Participants\u00a0said\u00a0the demonstration aimed to draw attention to all farm murders in the region, not solely those involving White farmers. Elon Musk previously shared the same video on X, posting it on\u00a0March 8\u00a0and\u00a0May 13\u00a0with the claim that the crosses represented White farmers.",
      "The video also included footage of a crowd at a rally being led in a chant against White farmers. After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Defense Department said Wednesday it has accepted a Boeing jet from Qatar that will be retrofitted and used to transport President Trump.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth accepted the Boeing 747 \"in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.\"",
      "\"The Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the President of the United States,\" Parnell said.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the Pentagon had accepted the jetliner from the government of Qatar.",
      "\"As directed by the Secretary of Defense, the Air Force is preparing to award a contract to modify a Boeing 747 aircraft for executive airlift. Details related to the contract are classified,\" a spokesperson for the Air Force said in a statement.",
      "Hegseth's acceptance of the plane comes days after sources confirmed to CBS News that the Qatari royal family would be donating aircraft for Mr. Trump's use. The gift was first reported by ABC News. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet will be donated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library just before he leaves office.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters last week that the Qataris are \"giving us a gift\" and lamented that the current plane used for Air Force One is nearly four decades old. When the president is aboard either of the two Boeing aircrafts that are part of the presidential air transport fleet, its call sign is \"Air Force One,\" according to the Air Force.",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",
      "The president has continued to defend the notion of receiving the plane from Qatar, writing on social media that the Boeing jet is being given to the Defense Department, and is a gift that will be used as a \"temporary Air Force One\" until new Boeing planes arrive.",
      "\"Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a\u00a0 country that wants to reward us for a job well done. This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,\" he wrote last week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also reiterated Monday that the plane is a donation to the nation and the Air Force.",
      "\"The government of Qatar, Qatari family, has offered to donate this plane to the United States Air Force, where that donation will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations,\" she said. \"It will be retrofitted to the highest of standards by the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force. This plane is not a personal donation or a gift to the president of the United States.\"",
      "Still, news of the gift raised concerns among members of Congress and questions of whether the transaction complied with federal ethics rules.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York sent a letter last week to three internal government watchdogs asking them to conduct an ethics review of the gift and issue an advisory opinion on whether it violates federal ethics regulations and the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign nations.",
      "\"The American presidency is not a personal inheritance. It does not exist to enrich Donald Trump,\" he wrote. \"It belongs to 'We the People.' If we fail to draw the line here, there may soon be no line left to draw.\"",
      "Some Republicans, too, have expressed unease with the gift from the Qatari government. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that there are \"lots of issues associated with that offer,\" which he said should be discussed further.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said that while he understands the need for a new Air Force One, \"I'd love to have a big, beautiful jet that's built in the United States of America.\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina warned \"everybody needs to know that Air Force One is not like every other Boeing.\"",
      "\"It's going to have to be put through a lot of paces and probably every square inch analyzed before I think the president should consider it as a primary means of transportation,\" he said.",
      "The secretary of the Air Force, Troy Meink, who was only confirmed last week, told Congress on Tuesday that the Air Force had already started looking into what modifications would be required to retrofit the jet.",
      "\"The secretary of defense has directed the Air Force to basically start planning to modify the aircraft. We are postured to do that,\" Meink told Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who asked about the potential security concerns of such a transfer.",
      "Meink said turning any civilian aircraft to Air Force One standards \"will take significant modifications.\"",

      "A pro-Russian former politician from Ukraine was fatally shot Wednesday morning outside his children's school in the Spanish capital Madrid, according to the Reuters news agency and multiple Spanish outlets. Andriy Portnov was killed outside the American School of Madrid by an unidentified gunman or gunmen, according to the reports.",
      "\"Several persons shot him in the back and the head and then fled toward a forested area,\" Reuters quoted an unnamed source at the Spanish Interior Ministry as saying.",
      "There was no immediate confirmation of the slain man's identity by Spain's National Police or other authorities, and no indication of a motive or any suspects who might have been identified. Witnesses told Spanish media that at least one possible suspect was seen running into a nearby wooded area.",
      "According to Spain's El Diario newspaper, citing witnesses, Portnov was shot right after dropping off his children at the American School. Photos from the scene showed a man's body lying motionless on the ground behind a Mercedes sedan.",
      "Portnov was a senior aid to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, a pro-Russian leader who was ousted during the Euromaidan Revolution in 2014. That ouster brought Ukraine's current, Western-backed government to power, and it infuriated Russia, which launched its first, initial invasion of Ukrainian territory that same year, quickly culminating in the unilateral annexation of Crimea.",
      "Portnov was a lawyer, and his political opponents in Ukraine had accused him of helping build a legal framework to enable the former government in Kyiv to crack down on protesters during the 2014 pro-democracy uprising.",
      "Portnov continued living in Ukraine after the 2014 revolution, despite his close ties with the Yanukovich administration, until he left the country in 2022, according to the Radio Freedom Ukraine network.",
      "In 2021, Portnov was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department under the Magnitsky Act, an American law designed to target foreign individuals implicated in corruption and human rights abuses.",
      "The U.S. government accused him of having \"cultivated extensive connections to Ukraine's judicial and law enforcement apparatus through bribery,\" and said he had been \"credibly accused of using his influence to buy access and decisions in Ukraine's courts and undermining reform efforts.\"",

    "summary": "Trump's plans to build a \"Golden Dome\" U.S. missile defense system undermine \"global strategic balance and stability,\" and should be abandoned, China says.",
    "story": [
      "China said Wednesday that the Trump administration's plan to construct a so-called \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the U.S. from missile attacks carries \"strong offensive implications\" and will increase the risks of a global arms race and militarizing outer space. President Trump said Tuesday that his administration had \"officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system,\" and that a budget package currently being deliberated by Congress would provide an initial $25 billion in funding for the project.",
      "An unclassified assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency shows the military expects to be contending with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" noting specifically that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "\"North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability,\" the DIA assessment said, warning that already, \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\"",
      "But China, which has been deepening its ties with Russia while rapidly developing its missile and other military capabilities, including its nuclear weapons, accused the Trump administration of obsessing over U.S. defense at the risk of endangering global security.",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself. This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Wednesday during a regular briefing in Beijing, according to multiple international news agencies.",
      "The White House plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield, fuels an arms race, and undermines international security,\" she said. \"We urge the United States to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has said for years that China and Russia are already deploying weapons in space, with reports suggesting everything from laser weapons to Chinese satellites with the ability to disable or even capture American satellites. Last year, the U.S. warned Russia against deploying a\u00a0nuclear-capable anti-satellite weapon that analysts believe could loiter in space for long periods of time before emitting a burst that would disable all satellites around it.",
      "In Russia's capital, meanwhile, the Kremlin said Wednesday that Mr. Trump's plans would require consultations between Moscow and Washington, but a spokesperson said it was largely a \"sovereign matter\" for the U.S.",
      "It was a softer stance than taken previously by the regime of President Vladimir Putin, which had recently published a statement saying the new American missile defense system would explicitly give Moscow an impetus \"for a significant strengthening of the arsenal for conducting combat operations in space.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, as he made his announcement, that he'd not yet spoken with Putin about his plans, but he said he would, \"at the right time.\"",
      "China and Russia, in a joint statement issued earlier in the month, called the Golden Dome project, \"deeply destabilizing in nature,\" and the two U.S. adversaries said it would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV called Wednesday for sufficient humanitarian aid to be allowed into war-ravaged Gaza, where humanitarian agencies say a total blockade has sparked critical food and medicine shortages. Israel has, under massive pressure from the U.S. and other allies, started to allow more aid into Gaza this week, but it has not eased its military operations, and aid agencies say the amount of humanitarian goods entering the strip is nowhere near enough to meet the urgent needs of a battered civilian population.",
      "The United Nations announced Monday that it had been cleared to send in aid for the first time since Israel imposed a total blockade on March 2, sparking severe shortages of food and medicine.",
      "\"The situation in the Gaza Strip is worrying and painful,\" the pope said during his first weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square. \"I renew my heartfelt appeal to allow the entry of sufficient humanitarian aid and to put an end to the hostilities, the heartbreaking price of which is paid by children, the elderly, the sick.\"",
      "Leo, who was elected on May 8 to be the Catholic Church's first U.S. pope, has made peace an early theme of his papacy, calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The Israeli army has stepped up its offensive in Gaza in recent days, with the enclave's Hamas-run Ministry of Health saying some 600 people have been killed over the last week alone. Israel says both the restrictions on aid and the stepped-up military campaign are aimed at pressuring Hamas \u2014 long designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel \u2014 to release the remaining 58 hostages held in Gaza and to accept a ceasefire on Israeli terms.",
      "Israel has vowed to carry on with its war until the hostages, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive, are free, Hamas is defeated and disarmed and its leaders are sent into exile. The war was sparked by the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 taken as hostages into Gaza.",
      "The health ministry, which does not differentiate between combatant and civilian casualties, says more than 53,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory war, many of them women and children.",
      "Charity calls Israeli easing of Gaza blockade \"a smokescreen\"",
      "The amount of aid Israel has started to allow into war-ravaged Gaza is not nearly enough and is \"a smokescreen to pretend the siege is over,\" the MSF aid group said Wednesday.",
      "\"The Israeli authorities' decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza, while in fact keeping them barely surviving,\" said Pascale Coissard, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) emergency coordinator in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. \"The current authorization for 100 [trucks] per day, when the situation is so dire, is woefully inadequate.\"",
      "\"Meanwhile, evacuation orders are continuing to uproot the population, while Israeli forces are still subjecting health facilities to intensive attacks,\" Coissard said.",
      "Israel said 93 trucks had entered Gaza from Israel on Tuesday, but the United Nations said the aid had been held up.",

      "Rubio said the U.S. was working with the U.N.'s World Food Program \"to walk through some of the ideas and plans they had for distribution\" of aid inside Gaza, but he stressed that in the administration's view, \"ultimately the answer here is for this [war] to end, hopefully with the elimination of Hamas, because the people of Gaza deserve a more prosperous, peaceful future, which they will never have as long as Hamas exists.\"",

    "story": [
      "A soaring death toll in the Gaza Strip and an increasingly vocal outcry over near-famine conditions in the Palestinian territory are piling pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a negotiated ceasefire with Hamas and drop his country's near-total blockade of the enclave. Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said Tuesday that at least 87 people were killed by Israeli military strikes over the last 24 hours alone.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces have ramped up operations in Gaza over the last week, killing hundreds of people, many of them women and children, in what Netanyahu's government insists is legitimate self-defense and aimed entirely at securing the return of 58 hostages still held by Hamas and its allies in Gaza, and destroying the group. Israel blames Hamas \u2014 long designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 for all casualties in Gaza, accusing the group of operating in and around civilian infrastructure.",
      "On Monday, for the first time in two and a half months, Netanyahu permitted a handful of trucks carrying aid to enter Gaza. He said he had been pressured into easing the total blockade by allies who could not tolerate \"images of mass famine.\"",
      "There were unconfirmed reports on Tuesday that as many as 100 trucks had been allowed to cross the Gaza border. But the United Nations' World Food Program said this week that a few trucks would be just a drop in the bucket given the vast and urgent need for food in Gaza, where more than 2 million Palestinians have been trapped for more than two years of blistering war.",
      "Thousands of trucks have been lined up for weeks just across the Gaza border, waiting to cross in. No food, fresh water or medicine had entered the territory for nearly 80 days under the Israeli blockade. Hunger is so rife that full-blown famine is once again stalking Gaza's population, according to the WFP's director for the Palestinian territories, Antoine Renard, who's just returned from the enclave.",
      "\"You have around an estimated 14,000 children that I know are facing what we call severe acute malnutrition,\" he told CBS News on Monday, meaning those children could die without rapid intervention. \"We always wait for when 'famine' is on. But when famine is on, it's already too late. That will be a failure of all the international community.\"",
      "Until this week, Israel's government had insisted there were no food shortages in Gaza. But for the first time, in a message posted Monday on social media, Netanyahu acknowledged that Gaza is nearing a hunger crisis.",
      "\"Our best friends in the world, senators that I know as enthusiastic Israel supporters, who I know for many years, are come to me and telling me, 'we give you all the support for a final victory \u2014 arms, support on your maneuvers to destroy Hamas, support at the U.N. Security Council. There is one thing we cannot endure \u2014 pictures of mass famine. This is something we are unable to witness. We will not be able to support you.'\"",
      "As a result of that pressure, he's allowing the limited amount of aid into Gaza.",
      "Renard said the WFP had sufficient food on standby, ready to enter, to feed the entire population of Gaza for a month.",
      "\"It must stop,\" he said of the Israeli blockade. \"The civilian population shouldn't be trapped. There's no reason, actually, to hold them accountable for what they are not part of.\"",
      "Netanyahu did not name any of the nations exerting pressure on his government to ease the blockade, and while Israel's closest and most vital ally the U.S. was almost certainly the country he referred to when mentioning long-friendly senators, it's not just the U.S. calling for a resolution to the crisis \u2014 and other countries have been doing so more assertively.",
      "In a strongly worded statement published Monday, the leaders of the U.K., France and Canada called the level of human suffering in Gaza intolerable, and they threatened to take action.",
      "\"The Israeli Government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We oppose any attempt to expand settlements in the West Bank ... We will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions.\"",
      "Netanyahu decried the threat, saying in a statement that by \"asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottowa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities.\"",
      "\"The war can end tomorrow if the remaining hostages are released, Hamas lays down its arms, its murderous leaders are exiled and Gaza is demilitarized,\" said the Israeli leader. \"No nation can be expected to accept anything less and Israel certainly won't. This is a war of civilization over barbarism. Israel will continue to defend itself by just means until total victory is achieved.\"",
      "Israel has escalated its war with a new offensive that has killed nearly 600 people over the last week, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.",
      "Doctors are running out of supplies \u2014 barely able to treat malnourished children, let alone the hundreds of people injured by the Israeli strikes who stream in day after day.",
      "The war in Gaza was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and left 251 others as hostages in Gaza. Israel's retaliatory war has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, displaced 90% of its population \u2014 most of them multiple times \u2014 and killed more than 53,500 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

    "story": [
      "A pack of veterinarians clambered over hefty metal crates on Tuesday morning, loading them one by one onto a fleet of semi-trucks. Among the cargo: tigers, monkeys, jaguars, elephants and lions \u2014 all fleeing the latest wave of cartel violence eclipsing the northern Mexican city of Culiacan.",
      "For years, exotic pets of cartel members and circus animals have been living in a small animal refuge on the outskirts of Sinaloa's capital. However, a bloody power struggle erupted last year between rival Sinaloa cartel factions, plunging the region into unprecedented violence and leaving the leaders of the Ostok Sanctuary reeling from armed attacks, constant death threats and a cutoff from essential supplies needed to keep their 700 animals alive.",
      "The aid organization is now leaving Culiacan and transporting the animals hours across the state in hopes that they'll escape the brunt of the violence. But fighting has grown so widespread in the region that many fear it will inevitably catch up.",
      "\"We've never seen violence this extreme,\" said Ernesto Zazueta, president of the Ostok Sanctuary. \"We're worried for the animals that come here to have a better future.\"",
      "Violence in the city exploded eight months ago when two rival Sinaloa Cartel factions began warring for territory after the dramatic kidnapping of Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the leader of one of the groups, by a son of notorious capo Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n who then delivered him to U.S. authorities via a private plane.",
      "Zambada and \"El Chapo's\" son Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez were arrested when they landed in Texas.",
      "Since then, intense fighting between the heavily armed factions has become the new normal for civilians in Culiacan, a city that for years avoided the worst of Mexico's violence in large part because the Sinaloa Cartel maintained such complete control.",
      "\"With the escalating war between the two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, they have begun to extort, kidnap and rob cars because they need funds to finance their war,\" said security analyst David Saucedo. \"And the civilians in Culiacan are the ones that suffer.\"",
      "Animals scared by cartel fighting",
      "Zazueta, the sanctuary director, said their flight from the city is another sign of just how far the warfare has seeped into daily life.",
      "This week, refuge staff loaded up roaring animals onto a convoy as some trainers attempted to sooth the animals. One murmured in a soft voice as he fed a bag of carrots to an elephant in a shipping container, \"I'm going to be right here, no one will do anything to you.\"",
      "Veterinarians and animals, accompanied by the Mexican National Guard, began traveling along the freeway to seaside Mazatlan, where they planned to release the animals into another wildlife reserve.",
      "The relocation came after months of planning and training the animals, a move made by the organization in an act of desperation. They said the sanctuary was caught in the crossfire of the warfare because of its proximity to the town of Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, a stronghold of Los Chapitos, one of the warring factions.",
      "During intense periods of violence, staff at the sanctuary can hear gunshots echoing nearby, the roar of cars and helicopters overhead, something they say scares the animals. Cartel fighting regularly blocks staff off from reaching the sanctuary, and some animals have gone days without eating. Many have started to lose fur and at least two animals have died due to the situation, Zazueta said.",
      "Complicating matters is the fact that an increasing number of the animals they rescue are former narco pets left abandoned in rural swathes of the state. In one case, a Bengal tiger was discovered chained in a plaza, caught in the center of shootouts. Urban legends circulate in Sinaloa that capos feed their enemies to pet lions. The U.S. Justice Department alleged in an indictment released in 2023 that the sons of \"El Chapo\" and their cartel associates fed some of their victims \"dead or alive to tigers.\"",
      "Diego Garc\u00eda, a refuge staff member, is among those who travel out to rescue those animals. He said he regularly receives anonymous threats, with callers claiming to know his address and how to find him. He worries he'll be targeted for taking away the former pets of capos. Zazueta said the refuge also receives calls threatening to burn the sanctuary to the ground and kill the animals if payment isn't made.",
      "\"There's no safe place left in this city these days,\" said Garc\u00eda.",
      "That's the feeling for many in the city of 1 million. When the sun rises, parents check for news of shootouts as if it were the weather, to determine if it's safe to send their kids to school. Burned houses sit riddled with bullets and occasionally bodies appear hanging from bridges outside the city. By night, Culiacan turns into a ghost town, leaving bars and clubs shuttered and many without work.",
      "\"My son, my son, I'm here. I'm not going to leave you alone,\" screamed one mother, sobbing on the side of the road and cursing officials as they inspected her son's dead body, splayed out and surrounded by bullet casings late Monday night. \"Why do the police do nothing?\" she cried out.",
      "\"What are we doing here?\"",
      "In February, while driving a refuge vehicle used for animal transport, Garc\u00eda said he was forced from the car by an armed, masked man in an SUV. At gunpoint, they stole the truck, animal medicine and tools used by the group for rescues and left him trembling on the side of the road.",
      "The breaking point for the Ostok Sanctuary came in March, when one of the two elephants in their care, Bireki, injured her foot. Veterinarians scrambled to find a specialist to treat her in Mexico, the United States and beyond. No one would brave the trip to Culiacan.",
      "\"We asked ourselves, 'what are we doing here?'\" Zazueta said. \"We can't risk this happening again. If we don't leave, who will treat them?\"",
      "The concern by many is that Mexico's crackdown on the cartels will be met with even more violent power moves by criminal organizations, as has happened in the past, said Saucedo, the security analyst.",
      "Zazueta blames local government and security forces for not doing more, and said their pleas for help in the past eight months have gone unanswered.",
      "Sinaloa's governor's office did not immediately respond to a request comment.",
      "The sanctuary made the move without any public announcement, worried that they might face repercussions from local officials or the same cartels forcing them to flee, but they hope the animals will find some relief in Mazatlan after years of conflict.",
      "Garc\u00eda, the sanctuary staff member, is not so sure. While he hopes for the best, he said he's also watched cartel violence spread like a cancer across the Latin American country. Mazatlan, too, is also facing bursts of violence, though nothing compared to the Sinaloan capital.",
      "\"It's at least more stable,\" he said. \"Because here, today, it's just suffocating.\"",
      "Cartel violence is also frequent in the central state of Guanajuato, Mexico's most deadly state. This week, gunmen opened fire and killed seven people, including some minors, in a plaza in the city of San Felipe, police said. The violent crime is believed to be linked to conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the most powerful in Mexico.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday announced his administration has selected the architectural design for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the United States from foreign threats.",
      "The president also said the budget package Republicans are currently ironing out on Capitol Hill will include an initial $25 billion to begin construction on the missile defense system. Mr. Trump said the project's total cost will be about $175 billion, although it could be much more. Congress hasn't yet funded any of the project, although Mr. Trump told reporters he thinks it'll be easy to fund on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies.",
      "Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can.",
      "\"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\"",
      "The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around.",
      "\"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\"",
      "The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In his March joint address to Congress, the president requested funding for the system.",
      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011.

If push comes to shove, they can then have the President weigh in and use his powers to coax those holdouts to vote yes.",
      "Here\u2019s the long-term outlook: If the House passes the bill, this goes to the Senate. This will be a project which will consume most of June. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) wants this done by July 4. But the question is what the Senate actually produces. The House and Senate must be on the same page. If the Senate crafts a different legislative product, then this must return to the House to sync up. Either the House eats what the Senate put together. Or the House and Senate must blend their differing versions together into a single, unified bill. That could take most of July. Remember that this bill includes an increase in the debt ceiling. The Treasury says Congress must lift the debt ceiling by early August.",

I\u2019m telling you, the Department of Education is one of the most important departments in this country. And you should feel shameful to be engaged with an administration that doesn\u2019t give a damn.\"",

      "\"Let\u2019s focus on literacy. What we\u2019re seeing in those scores is a failure of our students to learn to read,\" McMahon said. \"We\u2019ve lost the fundamentals.\"",

      "Staying safe online takes a little extra effort, but it's well worth it. Here are some steps you can follow to avoid falling victim to scam ads.",
      "1. Check the source and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Look for verified pages and official websites. Scammers often copy the names and logos of trusted brands, but the web address or page details may be off. Always double-check the URL for slight misspellings or extra characters and avoid clicking links in ads if you're unsure about their legitimacy.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true:\u00a0If an ad offers products at an unbelievable price or promises huge returns, pause and investigate before clicking. Scammers often use flashy discounts or urgent language to lure people in quickly. Take a moment to think before you act, and remember that if something sounds impossible, it probably is.",
      "3. Research the seller:\u00a0Search for reviews and complaints about the company or individual. If you can't find any credible information, it's best to avoid the offer. A quick online search can reveal if others have reported scams or had bad experiences, and legitimate businesses usually have a track record you can verify.",
      "4. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0There are companies that can help remove your personal info from data brokers and people-search sites. This means less of your data floating around for scammers to find and use. While these services usually charge a fee, they can save you a lot of time and hassle compared to doing it all yourself. Over time, you might notice fewer spam calls, emails and even a lower risk of identity theft.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5. Never share sensitive information:\u00a0Don't enter your credit card or bank details on unfamiliar sites. If you're asked for personal information, double-check the legitimacy of the request. Scammers may ask for sensitive data under the guise of \"verifying your identity\" or processing a payment, but reputable companies will never ask for this through insecure channels.",
      "6. Keep your devices updated: Keeping your\u00a0software updated adds an extra layer of protection against the latest threats. Updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers might try to exploit. By regularly updating your devices, you help close those security gaps and keep your personal information safer from scammers and malware.",
      "7. Report suspicious ads:\u00a0If you see a scam ad on Facebook or Instagram, report it using the platform's tools. This helps alert others and puts pressure on Meta to take action. Reporting is quick and anonymous, and it plays a crucial role in helping platforms identify patterns and remove harmful content.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts:\u00a0Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions, especially after making online purchases. Early detection can help you limit the damage if your information is compromised, and most banks have fraud protection services that can assist you if you spot something suspicious.",
      "By following these steps, you can better protect yourself and your finances from online scams. Staying alert and informed is your best defense in today's digital world.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The mess with scam ads on Meta's platforms shows why it's important to look out for yourself online. Meta says it's working on the problem, but many people think it's not moving fast enough. By staying careful, questioning suspicious offers and using good security tools, you can keep yourself safer. Until the platforms step up their game, protecting yourself is the smartest move you can make.",

      "Removing your personal information from people-search sites can feel pretty overwhelming. There are hundreds of these sites in the U.S. alone. In fact, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse says there are over 500 companies that collect and sell personal information.",
      "At first, it might seem impossible to get your details removed from all of them. But here's the good news: You don't need to tackle every single site. Your information isn't on all 500-plus sites.",

      "First, find which people-search sites have your info",
      "The process will be easier if you have a list of people-search sites that have your personal information. Not only can you check them off as you go, but you'll also need a list for the last step. The easiest place to start is with a\u00a0free scan that some data removal services provide. These scans automatically check a ton of people-search sites for your personal information and send you a report. You can also search for your full name on Google. This will probably bring up a mix of results, including your social media profiles.",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR DATA YOURSELF? HERE'S WHY YOU'RE PROBABLY WRONG",
      "The bigger your online presence, the more search results you'll likely have to sift through to find the people-search sites. I recommend searching for your name together with other personal details, like your email, phone number or home address. For some reason, this is more likely to bring up people-search sites, different ones depending on the combination of personal details you try. You may not be able to find all the people-search sites that have your info like this, though. You should also check any state-specific people-search sites, like\u00a0StateofFlorida.com, and search all of the most popular people-search sites like:",

      "Keep in mind that many smaller or niche sites exist, especially those that are state or region-specific. These sites can be harder to find but may still have your information. Using scanning tools or data removal services can help uncover these less obvious listings.",
      "Follow the opt-out process for each site",
      "Every people-search site has its own opt-out process, but most of them will require you to do something like this:",
      "Find your listing:\u00a0You'll usually need to search for your name, phone number, address or email on the site.Submit a removal request:\u00a0Most sites have an online form where you can request removal.

      "Pro tip: Use a separate email address for opt-out requests",
      "Many sites require email verification. Using your regular email can expose it to spam or further data collection. Creating a dedicated or alias email address just for these requests helps protect your primary inbox and keeps things organized. Also, using various email aliases makes it so you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone verification and a secondary number",
      "If a site requires phone verification, consider using a secondary number to avoid exposing your personal phone number. Services like\u00a0Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private. The process should take between five and 20 minutes for each site on your list, depending on how difficult they make it for you. But once you submit the request, removal is usually pretty quick. Your information should be off the site within 24 hours to a week, though it can sometimes take up to 30 days.",
      "Don't forget about Google search results",
      "People-search sites aren't the only places your info can pop up. Sometimes your personal info appears directly in Google search results, pulled from public records or other sites. If you find sensitive info in Google results, you can request removal through Google's own removal tools, especially if the info includes things like your Social Security number, bank account info or images you don't want to be public. This is a separate process, but it is worth doing alongside removing info from people-search sites.",
      "Google Search image (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Keep in mind, this isn't a one-and-done deal",
      "Even after you remove your info, there's a good chance it'll show up again. People-search sites constantly scrape public records and other databases to refresh their listings. Some sites offer \"suppression lists\" you can add your name to, but it's not a perfect system. Small changes, like a slightly different address, a new phone number or a missing middle name, can slip past their filters and pop up as a \"new\" profile.",
      "The best way to stay on top of it is to set a reminder to recheck the main people-search sites every few months and repeat the opt-out process when needed. Maintaining a detailed tracker or spreadsheet with the sites you've contacted, dates and confirmation info can make this easier and help you avoid missing any sites.",

Many of these laws require companies to honor requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal data, and some even require businesses to respect browser-based global opt-out signals. But even if you don't live in one of these states, you should still submit removal requests. Most people-search sites do not filter opt-out requests by state; they generally process any request they receive to avoid potential legal issues, regardless of your location.",
      "If this sounds like too much work, there's help",
      "Removing your data manually takes real time and commitment, especially since you have to keep doing it to stay off these sites. That's why many people turn to personal data removal services. Instead of going site by site yourself, a service can automatically send removal requests on your behalf, track the responses and re-request removals if your data reappears later.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Manual removal is free and gives you full control, but it takes time and requires ongoing effort. Automated services cost money but save you time, handle rechecks and can catch new listings faster. Choose what best fits your budget and privacy needs. If you follow these steps and stay consistent, you can take back control of your personal information online. It might take some work, but every removal counts toward protecting your privacy.",

And it's not just phone numbers, addresses or emails but also sensitive information like medical records, insurance details and more. This data is extremely valuable, which makes it a prime target for hackers.",
      "What's worse is that many healthcare institutions often neglect cybersecurity and treat it as an afterthought. In 2024 alone, an industry tracker recorded 1,160 healthcare breaches that exposed 305 million patient records. This marked a 26% increase compared to the previous year.",

In other words, patient records passed from Ascension into a third party's system and were then siphoned off by cybercriminals.",
      "The attackers gained a broad array of information. Impacted patients' demographic and financial details, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender and Social Security numbers were exposed. Even more worryingly, the breach included clinical data from hospital stays, including physician names, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical record numbers and insurance details.

By comparison, the company had earlier disclosed the impact in state filings. For example, 114,692 Texas patients and 96 Massachusetts residents were individually notified of exposure. In response, Ascension is offering those affected two years of free identity monitoring services (credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration).",
      "For scale, Ascension is a major nonprofit health system, one of the largest in the U.S., operating 142 hospitals across North America. The company has not named the third-party partner, but its description fits a vendor whose secure file-transfer software was breached.",
      "The timing aligns with a series of\u00a0recent Cl0p ransomware attacks. Cl0p has publicly claimed responsibility for exploiting a zero-day flaw in Cleo's secure file-transfer products, stealing data from dozens of organizations worldwide. While Ascension itself was not directly hit by ransomware, its data might have ended up in that same attack campaign.",
      "Ascension's patients and employees are no strangers to data breaches. In May 2024, a\u00a0Black Basta ransomware attack compromised Ascension's own network. That incident, traced back to a single employee opening a malicious file, resulted in the exfiltration of data belonging to nearly 5.6 million people.",
      "The fallout was severe. Hospitals lost access to digital records, forcing clinicians to record vitals, medications and orders on paper. Elective procedures and some appointments were paused, and emergency services were redirected to unaffected facilities to avoid delays in care.",

      "Ways to protect yourself after the Ascension data breach",
      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Ascension data breach.",
      "1) Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, Ascension attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Ascension breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Ascension breach, including Social Security numbers and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports: Regularly check your credit reports through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6) Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7) Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Attackers have frequently targeted Ascension, but the company does not seem to be learning its lesson. If it were a one-off incident, it might be understandable. But how do you fail to strengthen cybersecurity after experiencing a nationwide blackout? Rather than being an isolated event, this breach feels like part of a larger pattern. The industry relies on complex vendor networks and outdated IT systems, while cybercriminals continue to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.",

      "Scammers are always coming up with new tricks. Just when you start feeling confident about spotting phishing emails, suspicious links and fake banking apps, they find a new angle. Lately, they have been getting more creative, turning to the built-in features of our phones to pull off their schemes. One of the latest targets is NFC, the technology behind tap-to-pay.",
      "It might seem harmless, but a new scam is using it in ways most people would never expect. An Android malware called SuperCard goes beyond just stealing your card details. It gives attackers the ability to use your card remotely for real transactions. And the worst part is that it all begins with something as simple as a text message.",

      "An Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What makes SuperCard X different?",
      "SuperCard X stands out from other Android malware because of how it operates. As reported by\u00a0researchers at Cleafy, instead of stealing usernames, passwords or verification codes, it uses a method called NFC relay. This allows attackers to copy card data from a victim's device in real time and use it elsewhere to make payments or withdraw cash. The process does not require physical access to the card or knowledge of the PIN.",
      "The malware is offered through a Malware-as-a-Service model, which means different cybercriminals can use it in their own regions. This makes the threat more scalable and harder to contain. Unlike most banking trojans, SuperCard X is not focused on one specific institution. It targets any cardholder regardless of which bank issued their card.",
      "Another key difference is how stealthy the malware is. It uses minimal permissions and does not include extra features that would make it easier to detect. This lean approach helps it avoid detection by antivirus software and allows it to operate quietly on infected devices.",
      "SuperCardX fully undetectable (FUD | Cleafy) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How the scam works",
      "The fraud begins with a message sent through SMS or WhatsApp. It pretends to be from a bank and warns the recipient about a suspicious transaction. The message includes a phone number and urges the person to call to resolve the issue. This is the first step in gaining the victim's trust.",
      "Once on the phone, the attacker poses as a bank representative and walks the victim through a fake security process. This may include asking them to confirm personal details or adjust settings in their mobile banking app, such as removing spending limits on their card.",
      "Next, the attacker asks the victim to install a mobile app that is described as a tool to verify the account or enhance security. In reality, this app contains the SuperCard X malware. After the installation, the attacker instructs the victim to tap their card against the phone. The malware then captures the NFC data from the card and sends it to a second phone controlled by the attacker.",
      "Using the copied data, the attacker can make contactless payments or make ATM withdrawals almost instantly. This method allows them to steal funds quickly and leaves little opportunity for banks or victims to intervene in time.",
      "A woman scrolling on her phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "8 ways you can stay safe from SuperCard X malware",
      "1) Be cautious of suspicious texts and calls. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Fraudulent campaigns often begin with an SMS or call that seems to come from your bank. These messages usually claim there's suspicious activity on your account and urge you to click a link or dial a number to resolve the issue. However, this is a tactic used to gain access to your personal information. Always approach such messages with skepticism.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:\u00a0One of the key ways malware like SuperCard X spreads is through deceptive apps that victims are persuaded to install. These apps often look harmless, posing as tools for security or account verification. If you receive a link to download an app via SMS, email or messaging apps like WhatsApp, do not click on it. Instead, only download apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store. Additionally, carefully review app permissions and avoid granting unnecessary access, particularly to sensitive data like NFC, location or personal contacts.",
      "3) Turn off NFC when not in use:\u00a0NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a useful feature that allows contactless payments and data exchanges. However, it can be exploited by attackers to capture your card information without you even realizing it. To minimize your risk of falling victim to NFC-based malware like SuperCard X, turn off NFC when you're not actively using it.",
      "On most Android devices, you can do this by going to \"Settings,\" then \"Connected Devices\" or \"Connection Preferences,\" where you\u2019ll find the NFC toggle. By disabling NFC, your phone won't transmit data wirelessly, which helps protect your payment card information from being stolen by nearby attackers.",
      "4) Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and cards:\u00a0If your device has come into contact with the SuperCard or anything similar, it\u2019s possible your banking details are already compromised. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to regularly check your transaction history for anything odd, like a small payment you don\u2019t remember making or a charge from a strange location could be a sign of misuse. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your bank right away. It\u2019s also worth checking your credit reports every now and then to catch signs of identity theft before they snowball into bigger issues.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: If scammers have targeted you once, there's a higher chance they\u2019ll try again, especially if your personal details (like your phone number, address or email) are easily found online. Data removal services scan people-search sites and brokers, then request the removal of your info. This reduces your exposure and helps prevent future phishing or social engineering attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Contact your bank and freeze your cards:\u00a0If you think you\u2019ve tapped or handled a suspicious card, or if your phone acted strangely afterward, don\u2019t brush it off. Call your bank and let them know what happened. They can freeze your card to stop any unauthorized payments and issue a new one for added safety. You should also ask them to monitor your account more closely for a while. On top of that, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau so no one can easily open a new line of credit in your name.",
      "7) Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you've been targeted by a sophisticated scam like SuperCard X, there's a chance your personal information, not just your card data, may be at risk. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information, like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Report the scam to your national cybercrime authority: Whether or not you lost money, reporting the scam helps authorities track emerging threats and warn others. You can report such fraud to the FBI\u2019s\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center or the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. Your report could help catch the people behind the scam or at least shut down their infrastructure.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The SuperCard X malware campaign represents a significant shift in how cybercriminals are targeting individuals and financial institutions. By exploiting NFC technology and combining it with social engineering tactics, attackers have found a way to bypass traditional fraud detection systems. What's especially concerning is how quickly these attacks unfold, making them harder to detect before the damage is done. As this threat evolves, it's important for both consumers and institutions to recognize the potential risks of these multilayered fraud strategies.",

      "Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's so special about this flying machine?",
      "The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking.",

They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo.",
      "Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them.",
      "On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.",

      "Here are 14 essential protective measures to shield yourself from check washing scams.",
      "1. Use a black gel pen: When writing checks, always use a\u00a0black gel pen. The ink is much harder to remove compared to regular ballpoint pen ink.",
      "2. Bring checks directly to the post office when mailing them: If using a mailbox, make sure to drop off your mail before the final scheduled pickup so it is not left sitting overnight.",
      "3. Sign up for USPS Informed Delivery: Stay ahead by signing up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery. You will receive digital previews of incoming mail so you can monitor for any missing items early. Learn more about why it's important\u00a0here.",
      "4. Monitor your bank accounts: Set up real-time alerts for check clearing and review your statements weekly to catch any suspicious activity. Also, ask your bank about any other fraud-prevention tools they offer to protect your accounts.",
      "5. Switch to digital payments when possible: Use your bank\u2019s mobile app to deposit checks without mailing or physically delivering them, reducing the risk of theft or tampering.",
      "6. Use checks with built-in security features: Choose checks printed on paper with watermarks, chemical-sensitive coatings or other security features that make check washing much harder.",
      "7. Limit the information on checks: Avoid unnecessary personal details. Do not print your Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number or phone number on your checks. The less information available, the less a fraudster can use.",
      "HOW CYBERSCAMS ARE DRAINING AMERICANS WALLETS BY THE BILLIONS",
      "8. Store checks securely: Keep blank checks in a safe place. Store your checkbook in a locked drawer or safe, not in your purse, car or an easily accessible location at home.",
      "9. Check your mailbox security: Install a\u00a0locking mailbox. If possible, use a mailbox with a lock to prevent thieves from stealing outgoing or incoming mail.",
      "10. Be cautious with endorsements: When endorsing checks, write \"For Deposit Only\" along with your account number to prevent others from cashing the check.",
      "11. Enroll in identity theft protection with check fraud specialization: Choose services that specifically monitor for compromised check details on dark web marketplaces and alert you to suspicious check-cashing patterns.

      "12. Invest in personal data removal services: Minimize exposure of sensitive details (like addresses or banking affiliations) that fraudsters could exploit for check-washing scams. Removing your personal information from these sites can help reduce your risk of becoming a victim. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "13. Shred sensitive documents: Shred old checks and bank statements. Don\u2019t just throw them away. Shred any documents with sensitive banking information.",
      "14. Report suspicious activity immediately: If you suspect check fraud or missing mail, report it to your bank and the\u00a0U.S. Postal Inspection Service right away.",
      "15. Use Positive Pay if you are a business:\u00a0Positive Pay is a fraud prevention service offered by most banks to business customers. It works by matching the checks you issue with the ones presented for payment. If something doesn\u2019t add up, like a changed amount or payee, the bank flags it for your review before it\u2019s processed. You usually need to sign up through your bank, and there might be a fee, but it\u2019s a smart way to protect your business from check fraud, especially if you write a lot of checks.",

Even if the system still runs smoothly, it becomes more vulnerable to cyber threats like\u00a0malware,\u00a0ransomware,\u00a0phishing attacks and\u00a0data theft. An outdated operating system is like an unlocked door. Hackers and malicious software often target these systems specifically because of their weaknesses.

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

These services allow you to securely store your photos, videos and documents in the cloud, freeing up valuable storage on your device. One significant advantage of cloud storage is accessing files from any device with an internet connection, whether on your phone, tablet or another computer.",
      "Most cloud services provide a certain amount of free storage (typically between 2GB and 15GB) before upgrading to a paid plan. For instance,\u00a0Google Drive offers 15GB of free storage shared across Google services, while\u00a0Dropbox\u00a0provides 2GB for free with options to upgrade for more space.\u00a0OneDrive provides 5GB for free, but Microsoft users can get additional storage through Office 365 subscriptions, granting access to the Microsoft Office suite.",
      "Additionally, cloud storage services come with features like automatic syncing and backup, making it easier to organize and safeguard your files. This can be particularly helpful for large photo and video libraries, which can be set to upload automatically from your phone or computer. With features like file versioning and collaboration tools, cloud platforms offer more than just storage \u00a0\u2014 they enhance productivity and allow seamless file sharing with friends, family or colleagues.",

The following steps will help you protect your files and personal data from cyber threats and accidental loss.",
      "1. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Create unique, complex passwords for all your accounts and devices. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store secure passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

      "4.\u00a0Install and maintain strong antivirus software: Use a strong antivirus program and keep it updated to protect against malware and other security threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Regularly update your operating system and applications: Keep your devices and software\u00a0up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public networks, or use a VPN for added security. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Backup your data regularly: Create\u00a0multiple backups of your important files, including at least one offline copy.",
      "8. Use secure file transfer methods: When sharing files, use encrypted transfer methods or\u00a0password-protected links.",
      "By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your data and protect yourself from potential cyber threats.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Your PC\u2019s storage can fill up fast, but you can always free up some space. I personally prefer storing images and videos that take up too much space on an external drive. This way, I can access them whenever I need to while keeping my PC storage free. If an external drive feels like too much of a hassle, you can always opt for cloud storage. Windows supports a range of cloud storage options, including its own services like OneDrive.",

      "Parents vented their fury at a Virginia school board meeting after a trans girl used a boys locker room sparking a Title IX investigation",
      "Furious parents vented their anger at a Virginia county school board meeting on Tuesday following news that three male students are under investigation after they were recorded in a male locker room complaining about a biological female getting changed alongside them.",
      "The Loudoun County Public Schools -- which made national headlines in 2021 when a father was arrested and hauled out of a board meeting for speaking out about the sexual assault of his daughter by a trans student at a local school -- is investigating the boys for Title IX violations.",
      "The trans boy, a biological female, recorded them questioning why \"a girl\" was present, with one student expressing that he felt \"uncomfortable\" about the situation at Stone Bridge High School.",
      "Tensions flared at a school board meeting Tuesday over a policy that allows trans people to use the locker room that fits their gender. Boys who were recorded complaining are now under investigation. (Fox 5)",
      "TENSIONS FLARE AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETING AFTER TRANS ATHLETE WINS MULTIPLE TRACK EVENTS",
      "It is illegal to record inside locker rooms, but a Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) official confirmed to Fox 5 DC that none of the boys appeared in compromising positions in the video and, therefore, it was determined that no privacy laws were violated.",
      "Nevertheless, the boys are under investigation for allegedly violating policy 8040, a controversial guideline adopted in 2021 that permits students to use restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity rather than their biological sex.",
      "Scott Smith, the father arrested during that heated incident in 2021, took to the mic and blasted the board, accusing them of initially denying that his daughter had been raped and warning them that their policies could lead to similar consequences for other students.",
      "\"And now four years later you\u2019re doing the same damn thing,\" Smith said. \"You\u2019re victimizing innocent children over the priority of kids that don\u2019t know,\" he said before his mic appeared to be muted after his one-minute speaking slot had expired and he was told to hand step aside.",
      "CALIFORNIA TRACK MEET TURNS TO POLITICAL RALLY OVER TRANS ATHLETES AS SCHOOLS SPEAK OUT VS. STATE",
      "\"I\u2019m not done yet,\" Smith roared. \"You guys are sick and pathetic,\" he said to applause.",
      "Smith\u2019s words, and the words of some 130 parents who spoke, were not recorded on video, as the board voted last year to omit a video display during the public comment section of its board meetings.",
      "The decision was blasted by Smith at the time, who told \"America's Newsroom\" that the board was trying to shut down public dissent to their radical policies. Smith's daughter was sexually assaulted at Stone Bridge High School by a transgender student in 2021.",
      "Smith was convicted of disorderly conduct stemming from the 2021 school board meeting, but he was later pardoned by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",
      "Suzanne Satterfield also took aim at the board on Tuesday,\u00a0saying that children rely on adults to be truthful and protect them from harm.",
      "\"Every girl and boy has the right to feel secure using private spaces without being invaded by the opposite sex,\" Satterfield said. \"Every day that policy 8040 remains in play children are being lied to so that that they can be born in the wrong body can change their sex.\"",
      "A parent holds a sign reading: \"End 8040,\" pertaining to a policy that permits students to use restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity rather than their biological sex.\u00a0 (Fox 5)",
      "Speaker\u00a0Amy Paul\u00a0ripped the board and said that policy 8040 is \"insane.\"",
      "\"You all have helped facilitate this charade for long enough and it's time to put an end to the madness,\" Paul said. \"You're investigating three young men for having common sense enough to state the obvious, girls do not belong in boys locker rooms.\"",
      "WATCH: Pardoned father says he was used to \u2018silence\u2019 parents from protecting children: Scott Smith",
      "\"Please don't tell me that he or she is really a he, we're done playing that game, there is no such thing as a child born in the wrong body\u2026 You're taking kids who have serious issues and instead of trying to understand why they're rejecting their true selves, you encourage them to go down a path that could lead to irreparable harm to their bodies. It's time for you to act like the adults.\"",
      "Not everyone disagreed with policy 8040, with one female speaker saying that the policy was created with input from experts, data and community feedback to ensure that all students are safe, seen and supported. She said the uproar has conveniently come about because of the gubernatorial election later this year.",
      "\"Transgender people exist. They always have no executive order, sermon or headline or public comment can erase them,\" she said.",

      "The suspect shouted \u201cFree, free Palestine\u201d while in police custody and \u201cimplied\u201d that he committed the shooting, Washington Police Chief Pamela Smith said. He was identified as Elias Rodriguez, in his early 30s, of Chicago.",
      "In custody, he told authorities where he discarded the weapon, Smith added. Mayor Muriel Bowser said there was no active threat to the community following the arrest. There have so far been no charges.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "The victims were named by the embassy as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. Earlier, Yechiel Leiter, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States, said they were a couple on a night out and were about to get engaged.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has directed security increases for Israeli missions and representatives around the world.",
      "He offered his condolences to the victims, saying, \u201cMy heart grieves for the families of the young beloveds, whose lives were cut short in a moment by an abhorrent antisemitic murderer.\u201d",
      "The victims were leaving the museum, where an event was being held, when they were gunned down around 9 p.m., Leiter said. Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, confirmed in a statement that the group was hosting the gathering.",
      "The man had been pacing back and forth outside the museum when he approached a group of four and opened fire using a handgun, Smith said. He then entered the building, where he was detained by security, she said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, Tal Naim Cohen, described the victims as two staff members, adding that they \u201cwere shot this evening at close range while attending a Jewish event.\u201d",

      "Speaking to NBC News\u2019 international partner, Sky News, Jojo Drake Kalin said she mistook the suspected shooter for a bystander when he entered the building, offering him water because he seemed \u201cdistraught.\u201d",
      "\u201cI actually offered and gave him water, unbeknownst to me that I was actually looking evil in the eye,\u201d Kalin said. \u201cThere was commotion and a frenzy, but no one was aware of lives lost.\u201d",

      "The shooting comes more than 18 months after Israel launched a bombing campaign and ground invasion in Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas militants, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and hundreds more were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.",
      "Israel\u2019s counteroffensive has killed more than 53,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. International aid groups and governments have also warned of the risk of famine in the enclave. Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel would allow a limited amount of humanitarian aid to flow in following a three-month blockade.",

      "Other U.S. officials also decried the shooting.

      "Historically, these White House sit-downs were dull affairs, replete with grip-and-grin platitudes and geopolitical jargon. Not so during the second term of Trump, who has transformed his office into a gladiatorial arena.",
      "There was February\u2019s stunning bust-up by Vice President JD Vance against Zelenskyy. The same month, Abdullah could not hide his chagrin as Trump spoke at length about his plans to take control of the Gaza Strip.",
      "So, South Africa's Ramaphosa seemed unsurprised when Trump ambushed him Wednesday \u2014 the U.S. president even dimmed the lights for a screening of news clips alleging that white farmers are victims of a genocide in South Africa.",
      "Most experts agree this is a false, baseless claim, seized upon by Trump since employing as an adviser the South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, who was in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible sight \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Trump commentated while the footage played.",
      "Unlike other leaders, Ramaphosa \u2014 a former trade union leader and ally of Nelson Mandela who helped end apartheid \u2014 was clearly prepared. He spoke calmly and without interruption, politely but firmly disagreeing with Trump.",
      "\u201cIt will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends,\u201d he said, when asked what would convince the American leader he was mistaken.",
      "And there was a flourish of his own.",
      "Ramaphosa had brought with him Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, two white South African golfers who are both in the Hall of Fame and have won six U.S. Open titles between them.",
      "At a meeting alongside the golf-fanatic Trump, the intention behind the maneuver was unmistakable.",
      "\u201cIf there was Afrikaner farmer genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen would not be here,\u201d the South African leader said in the Oval Office, pointing to the white members of his entourage that also included John Steenhuisen, his agriculture minister. \u201cIt will take him, President Trump, listening to their stories, to their perspective.\u201d",
      "Whereas the Zelenskyy fiasco caught \u201ceveryone off guard with its intensity and its destructiveness,\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cplanned attack\u201d on Ramaphosa \u201ctook the stakes up a level,\u201d said Scott Lucas, a politics professor at Ireland\u2019s University College Dublin.",
      "\u201cRamaphosa seemed to have been very well briefed and he kept his cool,\u201d he said. \u201cLeaders around the world now have a playbook for how they deal with Trump.\u201d",

That too seemed to pay off: Ishiba arrived armed with charts clearly and colorfully illustrating Japan\u2019s investments in America and the kind of visual aids that Trump prefers.",
      "Like Starmer, he played to Trump\u2019s appetite for a theatrical gift, bringing with him a golden samurai helmet, which in Japan often signifies prayers for prosperity and longevity.",
      "Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron appears to have mastered the art of keeping a rapport with Trump while maintaining a macho-style resistance to some of his statements. During his own February Oval Office sit-down, he put his hand on Trump\u2019s arm and gently corrected his mistaken statement that European countries had merely \u201cloaned\u201d money to Ukraine.",
      "Even more stern, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney kept a straight back, clenched jaw and \u2014 though often struggling to get a word in edgewise \u2014 made it clear through words and firm hand gestures that \u201cCanada is not for sale.\u201d",
      "Even against this field, Ramaphosa\u2019s poise has been widely praised.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing preparing to be ambushed and another being able to manage the situation,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "\u201cMost people seem to think that Ramaphosa came out of it well,\u201d he added. \u201cThat may also be because he has good people skills, which meant that he was better placed than some world leaders to defuse the situation.\u201d",
      "However artful a sparring partner Ramaphosa was, it's still unclear how effective his tactics will be.",
      "\u201cYou wanted to see drama and something really big happening,\u201d Ramaphosa told reporters afterward, downplaying the episode. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that we disappointed you somewhat when it comes to that.\u201d",
      "But it was still a bruising and concerning encounter for a country that dearly needs American financial help.",

      "He called the encounter not only \u201cdeeply offensive and hurtful to a partnership that we have with a really important nation in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d but also said it \u201cdoes a major disservice to that Oval Office, that sacred space.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The White House on Thursday released its long-awaited \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report, painting a dire picture of American children\u2019s health. The lengthy federal assessment\u2019s goal is to identify the root causes of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "\u201cOur kids are the sickest kids in the world,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during a call with reporters Thursday morning.",
      "Ultraprocessed food and environmental toxins were at the top of Kennedy\u2019s list of problems that need to be urgently addressed to curb increases in chronic diseases during childhood. The report also cited sedentary, technology-driven lifestyles and the overprescribing of medications.",
      "The report was heavy on outlining problems, but light on concrete solutions.",
      "\u201cThe next stage of this process is to come up with policy recommendations for the president,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Trump commissioned the report in February in an executive order establishing the Make America Healthy Again Commission, a group of high-ranking federal officials tasked with reviewing research and making recommendations on chronic disease in children. The report echoes the priorities of Kennedy, who chairs the commission.",
      "Kennedy said Thursday that the assessment will inform a follow-up report on policy recommendations to be released in the next 100 days. He added that there is \u201cno budget\u201d to support the initiative at this point, given that \u201cthere\u2019s no concrete policy that could be funded in a budget.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think everybody wants to prioritize the ultraprocessed food crisis\u201d in those policy recommendations, he told NBC News on the call. Such foods have been linked to obesity, heart disease and cancer, but the strength and quality of these studies vary.",
      "As health secretary, Kennedy has been outspoken about all four subjects highlighted in the report. In his first nearly 100 days in office, he announced that he was asking the food industry to phase out artificial dyes from the food supply and directed the Food and Drug Administration to revise a rule that allows food manufacturers to use additives that are \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d without notifying the federal government. He also praised local efforts to restrict cellphone use in schools, ban fluoride in public water systems and prohibit the purchase of soda and energy drinks under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps.",
      "Kennedy has also called attention to what he sees as serious health risks associated with pesticides \u2014 in particular, the weed killer glyphosate, which Kennedy has said is linked to a range of diseases, including cancer. The evidence itself is mixed.",
      "While the MAHA report was widely anticipated to focus on pesticides, it instead highlights the \u201ccumulative load of chemicals in the environment,\u201d mentioning pesticides alongside other chemicals like PFAS, microplastics, fluoride, phthalates and bisphenols.",
      "Many Republican lawmakers and members of the agricultural industry had expressed concern leading up to the report\u2019s release that criticizing pesticide use could endanger farmers\u2019 livelihoods and erode public trust in the food supply.",
      "Kennedy told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday that he would not take any action to jeopardize the jobs of farmers who rely on glyphosate. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said on Thursday\u2019s press call that the federal government will continue to regularly review the safety of pesticides, but noted that abrupt changes in agricultural practices could adversely impact the domestic food supply.",
      "While the MAHA report addresses some real issues, \u201cthe problem is that they need to come up with meaningful solutions,\u201d said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.",
      "The report offers some hints of where the MAHA Commission might choose to place its focus. For instance, it recommends that the National Institutes of Health fund long-term trials comparing the effects of eating whole foods, reducing carbohydrate intake and minimizing ultraprocessed foods on obesity and insulin resistance in children.",
      "It also criticizes the current federal dietary guidelines for not explicitly addressing ultraprocessed foods, claiming the guidelines have \u201ca history of being unduly influenced by corporate interests.\u201d An independent advisory committee that evaluated the dietary guidelines under the Biden administration did not recommend any immediate changes for 2025-2030 to account for ultraprocessed foods.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to release a new, updated version of the guidelines before the end of the year. Kennedy, whose department is overseeing the revision in tandem with the Department of Agriculture, has said that the new version will be scrubbed of influence by the food industry.",
      "The MAHA report also recommends more research on the long-term health outcomes of commonly prescribed pediatric drugs. The report claims there are proven harms associated with overtreating children with antibiotics or medications for ADHD and depression, and \u201cpotentially major long-term repercussions\u201d associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (a class of antidepressants), puberty blockers and GLP-1 agonists (the class of weight loss and diabetes drugs that includes Ozempic).",
      "Benjamin said many of the suggested research areas in the report are already being studied, adding that the Trump administration\u2019s massive cuts to NIH grants could be at odds with their goal.",
      "\u201cThey keep saying that they want to do \u2018gold standard research\u2019 but they\u2019ve cut funding from many of the nation\u2019s leading academic centers,\u201d he said.",
      "The report made no mention of a leading cause of children\u2019s deaths in the country: guns."

      "The department also notes that demand for the penny has drastically decreased, as Americans increasingly shift their payment habits to cards or digital services like Apple Pay.",
      "There are more than 114 billion pennies currently in circulation."

      "The reality television star said she was \"dumbfounded\" by the state of the legal system when she first began this journey years ago.",
      "Kim Kardashian began her legal studies in 2019, telling Vogue magazine her passion for prison reform inspired her decision to pursue legal education. Although the entertainment mogul never obtained an undergraduate degree, California's \"reading law\" process allows future lawyers to participate in apprentice-style learning under a licensed attorney instead of attending a formal law school.",
      "In March, E! News reported that the 44-year-old took the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (MPRE), a requirement for admission to the California bar.",
      "\"Six years ago, Kim Kardashian walked into this program with nothing but a fierce desire to fight for justice,\" attorney Jessica Jackson, one of Kim Kardashian's mentors throughout her studies, said at the Wednesday ceremony. \"No law school lectures, no ivory tower shortcuts, just determination and a mountain of case log books to read.\u201d",

      "The decision by prosecutor Chris Becker is certain to upset civil rights activists and the family of Patrick Lyoya, the 26-year-old Congolese immigrant whose death in the front yard of a Grand Rapids home was recorded on video and played repeatedly at trial.",
      "Becker said he doubted that a second jury would come up with a different result.",

      "Schurr, who was a Grand Rapids officer, claimed self-defense, saying he feared for his life and shot Lyoya because the man had control of his Taser. He was charged with second-degree murder, though the jury also was allowed to consider a lesser charge of manslaughter.",
      "Lyoya\u2019s death in April 2022 was the climax of a fierce struggle that lasted more than two minutes. Schurr stopped a car for having the wrong license plate. Lyoya stepped out of the car, didn\u2019t produce a driver\u2019s license and began running.",
      "Schurr was on top of Lyoya on the ground when he shot him in the back of the head. The entire confrontation was recorded on video and repeatedly played for the jury.",
      "At trial, defense experts said the decision to use deadly force was justified because the exhausted officer could have been seriously injured if Lyoya had used the Taser. The prosecutor\u2019s experts, however, said Schurr had other choices, including simply letting Lyoya run.",
      "It\u2019s not known why Lyoya was trying to flee. Records show his driver\u2019s license was revoked at the time and there was an arrest warrant for him in a domestic violence case, though Schurr didn\u2019t know it. An autopsy revealed his blood-alcohol level was three times above the legal limit for driving."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Oklahoma will not be able to launch the nation's first religious public charter school after the Supreme Court on Thursday deadlocked 4-4 in a major case on the separation of church and state.",
      "The decision by the evenly divided court means that a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that said the proposal to launch St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School violates both the federal Constitution and state law remains in place. St. Isidore would have operated online statewide with a remit to promote the Catholic faith.",
      "As there was no majority, the court did not issue a detailed written decision, and the case sets no nationwide precedent on the contentious legal question of whether religious schools must be able to participate in taxpayer-funded state charter school programs.",
      "A key factor in the outcome was that conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who would have been the deciding vote, did not participate in the case. She did not explain why, but it is likely because of her ties with Notre Dame Law School. The law school's religious liberty clinic represents the school.",
      "The one-page decision did not say how each justice voted. During oral arguments last month, most of the court's conservatives indicated support for the school while liberals expressed concern. At least one conservative is likely to have sided with the liberals, most likely Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "The court will likely be asked to weigh in on the issue in future cases.",
      "The case was a victory for Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who challenged a state board's approval of the school and found himself on the opposite side of fellow Republicans in the state who backed the idea.",
      "Drummond, who is running for governor, said in a statement that the decision was a \u201cresounding victory for religious liberty\u201d that would ensure that taxpayer money would not go toward \u201cradical Islamic schools\" as well as the Catholic school at issue in the case.",
      "Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which challenged the school's approval in a separate case, also welcomed Thursday's decision.",
      "\"We will continue our efforts to protect inclusive public education. We call on this nation to recommit to church-state separation before this safeguard of democracy and freedom is further attacked,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt described the decision in an X post as a \"non-decision\" that did not resolve the issue.",
      "\"This is far from a settled issue,\" he wrote. \"We are going to keep fighting for parents\u2019 rights to instill their values in their children and against religious discrimination.\u201d",
      "The case highlights tensions within the Constitution's First Amendment; one provision, the Establishment Clause, prohibits state endorsement of religion or preference for one religion over another, while another, the Free Exercise Clause, bars religious discrimination.",
      "The Oklahoma Supreme Court had cited the state's interest in steering clear of Establishment Clause violations as a reason not to allow the proposal submitted by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa\u00a0to move forward.",
      "The state approved the proposal for St. Isidore in June 2023 despite concerns about its religious nature, prompting Drummond to file suit.",
      "The Supreme Court, when Barrett is participating, has a 6-3 conservative majority that often backs religious rights. In recent years it has repeatedly strengthened the Free Exercise Clause in cases brought by conservative religious liberty activists, sometimes at the expense of the Establishment Clause. Some conservatives have long complained that the common understanding that the Establishment Clause requires strict separation of church and state is incorrect.",
      "Lawyers representing the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board sought to portray the dispute as similar to a series of recent rulings in which the court said that under the Free Exercise Clause, states cannot bar religious groups from government programs that are open to everyone else.",
      "During the oral argument, Roberts pushed back, indicating that he saw the schools case as different from the previous decisions.",
      "Those cases, he said, \u201cinvolved fairly discrete state involvement\u201d compared with Oklahoma\u2019s charter school program.",
      "\u201cThis does strike me as a much more comprehensive involvement,\u201d he added.",
      "The push for religious public charter schools dovetails with the school choice movement, which supports parents using taxpayer funds to send their children to private school. Public school advocates see both efforts as broad assaults on traditional public schools.",
      "Looking ahead, Stephanie Barclay, an expert on religious liberty at Georgetown Law School, said that there are no immediate cases pending that raise the same precise issue as the Oklahoma dispute.",
      "But she highlighted a case from Maine that raises questions about the extent to which religious schools can be barred from receiving government funding through tuition assistance, which the Supreme Court may have a chance to hear relatively soon.",
      "\"That's a more likely next step the court could take,\" she said.\\"

Although the Trump administration has portrayed the spending bill as a means of sparking economic growth that can boost federal revenues, third-party analysts including the Congressional Budget Office and the Penn Wharton Budget Model say those projections are overly optimistic. Instead, they say, the bill is likely to  keep the United States\u2019 fiscal situation on its current trajectory.",
      "That track itself is \u2014 by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's own admission \u2014 already \"unsustainable.\"",
      "Thursday's bond market moves come in the wake of an unexpectedly poor Treasurys auction Wednesday that had also sent U.S. borrowing costs higher. And it follows the downgrade of U.S. debt last week from AAA by Moody's, which said the U.S. fiscal picture continues to \"deteriorate.\"",
      "For decades, the U.S. was able to finance its large entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare by borrowing money at relatively low interest rates. Even as spending on these programs continued to swell, rates remained low thanks in part to the recession sparked by the 2008-09 financial crisis, which put the U.S. economy into a lower gear of growth."

That too seemed to pay off: Ishiba arrived armed with charts clearly and colorfully illustrating Japan\u2019s investments in America and the kind of visual aids that Trump prefers.",
      "Like Starmer, he played to Trump\u2019s appetite for a theatrical gift, bringing with him a golden samurai helmet, which in Japan often signifies prayers for prosperity and longevity.",
      "Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron appears to have mastered the art of keeping a rapport with Trump while maintaining a macho-style resistance to some of his statements. During his own February Oval Office sit-down, he put his hand on Trump\u2019s arm and gently corrected his mistaken statement that European countries had merely \u201cloaned\u201d money to Ukraine.",
      "Even more stern, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney kept a straight back, clenched jaw and \u2014 though often struggling to get a word in edgewise \u2014 made it clear through words and firm hand gestures that \u201cCanada is not for sale.\u201d",
      "Even against this field, Ramaphosa\u2019s poise has been widely praised.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing preparing to be ambushed and another being able to manage the situation,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",

    "story": [
      "Aid workers struggling to distribute a trickle of aid entering the besieged Gaza Strip are describing a logistical \u201cnightmare\u201d in the midst of a spiraling humanitarian crisis.",
      "\u201cWith this limited amount of aid, the humanitarian situation continues to get worse and worse,\u201d Dr. Amjad Alshawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, an umbrella group of Palestinian organizations, told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cAt the same time, the Israelis are imposing restrictions on access to these supplies.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said humanitarian workers were able to pick up at least 90 truckloads of aid Wednesday night \u2014 but it was unclear whether that aid had been distributed as of Thursday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground described widespread frustration among Palestinians waiting to see whether more aid will flow into the enclave. Many charities have stopped or reduced their food offerings because of the scarcity of supplies and high cost of the rare goods available at markets.",
      "After lifting its almost three-month-long blockade of the entry of food, medicine and other aid into Gaza, Israel has allowed a trickle of supplies into the enclave in recent days amid mounting international pressure. Aid groups say it has also imposed a new set of rules on bringing in supplies, which they blame for logistical snarl-ups and a delay in food and medicine reaching those who need it.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military\u2019s liaison with the Palestinians, said Thursday that 198 trucks had entered Gaza, but did not specifically comment on the new procedures and referred NBC News to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for further comment, which it did not immediately provide.",
      "COGAT data suggested the majority of that aid has been food, with medicine and medical equipment making up a smaller share.",
      "Humanitarian groups have warned that the limited aid flowing in is a fraction of the amount needed, with an average of around 500 trucks a day entering in Gaza before the war, according to the British Red Cross.",
      "Despite that resumption, little if any aid entering Gaza had reached Palestinian civilians as of late Wednesday, with humanitarian groups saying that new procedures introduced by Israel have complicated an already tangled effort.",
      "Logistical 'nightmare'",
      "In a briefing Wednesday, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that in one instance, the rules meant that, \u201cIsraeli authorities had only allowed our teams to go through one area that was highly congested, that we felt was insecure and where we felt looting was highly likely to take place, given the prolonged deprivation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "While Israeli authorities have not specifically laid out what the new rules involve, Dujarric said Tuesday that humanitarian workers were being required to offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and then reload them separately once teams inside Gaza were allowed to collect them.",
      "He noted that one team waited \"several hours\" for such a green light, but were never able to transport the goods.",
      "Meanwhile, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, has found many of its trucks \u201cblocked for reasons that are sometimes unknown,\u201d its head of mission for the Palestinian Territories, Jean Guy Vataux, told NBC News in Jerusalem late Wednesday.",
      "While he added that some of the new procedures were \u201cput in place to avoid smuggling,\u201d the new system \u201cturns into a logistic nightmare for the agencies.\u201d",
      "'Malnutrition is growing'",
      "Meanwhile, \"malnutrition is growing\" in Gaza, Vataux said.",
      "An Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, report released earlier this month warned of the risk of famine if adequate access to food was not restored.",
      "The IPC snapshot warned that some 470,000 people in Gaza were facing \u201ccatastrophic hunger,\u201d while the entire population was experiencing food insecurity, the World Food Programme said. It further projected that an \u201calarming 71,000 children and more than 17,000 mothers\u201d would need \u201curgent treatment for acute malnutrition.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. clarified comments from its humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who had said some 14,000 babies were at risk of death within a short time frame. The body said that the same number of babies is facing severe malnutrition absent a significant and swift increase of aid into Gaza, with severe malnutrition posing the risk of death."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Thursday morning narrowly passed a massive domestic policy package, a major victory for President Donald Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., after weeks of heated intraparty negotiations and some last-minute changes.",
      "The multitrillion-dollar tax cut and spending measure now heads to the Senate, where Republicans have vowed to change it.",
      "Following hours of overnight debate, the vote on final passage in the House was 215-214, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio \u2014 joining all Democrats present in opposition.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the leader of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, voted present. Reps. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., and David Schweikert, R-Ariz., accidentally missed the vote, but said they would have voted yes.",
      "Garbarino \"fell asleep in the back, no kidding. I\u2019m going to just strangle him,\" Johnson joked to reporters, adding that Schweikert tried to vote but missed it by seconds.",
      "Dubbed by Trump as the \"big, beautiful bill,\" the legislation extends the president's expiring tax cuts passed in 2017 and contains an infusion of money to expand the military, beef up border security and carry out his mass deportation plans. It also fulfills two of Trump's campaign promises: eliminating taxes on tips and overtime work.",
      "The bill also slashes spending in other areas, including hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), while rescinding a series of clean energy tax credits passed by Democrats in 2022. And it raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Taking a victory lap after the vote, Johnson told reporters that the massive package had been on the verge of collapse at times.",
      "\"There\u2019s a lot of prayer that brought this together. I\u2019m just going to be very blunt about it. There was a few moments over the last week when it looked like the thing might fall apart,\" Johnson said, flanked by his GOP leadership team and committee chairmen. \"And I went to the little chapel over here and got on my knees and prayed that these guys would have wisdom and stamina and discernment.\"",
      "\"And that\u2019s the secret here. And teamwork and mutual respect that everybody has for one another, and I think that\u2019s what defines the Republican Party,\" he continued. \"It\u2019s a great day to be an American. It\u2019s great to be a Republican.\"",
      "But Johnson acknowledged there is still a long way to go in the process. The speaker had lunch with Senate Republicans this week and said he's encouraged them \u201cto modify this as little as possible.\" Any changes the Senate makes would have to be approved by the House.",
      "Congressional GOP leaders have said they want to send the final bill to Trump's desk for his signature by July 4.",
      "The vote came after Republicans and Democrats sparred over the legislation during a marathon House Rules Committee hearing that began just after 1 a.m. ET Wednesday and wrapped 21 hours later, when the panel sent the bill to the floor.",
      "The sweeping package included a series of last-minute changes to appease factions of GOP holdouts whose votes are essential in the slim House majority. Republicans can only spare three GOP defections on any vote in the face of unified Democratic opposition.",
      "Conservative hard-liners secured changes in the form of speeding up the Medicaid work requirements to begin at the end of 2026, and phasing out the clean energy tax credits more quickly.",
      "A group of blue-state Republicans secured a larger state and local deduction (SALT) cap of $40,000 to bring home to their high-tax districts.",
      "The measure was projected Tuesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to increase the national debt by $2.3 trillion. The budget office said it would rescind health care coverage for 8.6 million people.",
      "Overall, the package is set to decrease household resources among the lowest decile of income earners by 4%, while increase household resources among the highest decile of income earners by 2% by 2033.",
      "It is unclear what impact the late changes will have on the final estimate.",
      "Trump helped Johnson and GOP leaders close the deal, joining a House Republican conference meeting at the Capitol on Tuesday. The president told holdouts in the room that it was now time to drop their demands and unify behind his \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "When Harris and other conservatives dug in further Wednesday, Trump called the group's leaders and GOP leaders down to the White House to get them on board.",
      "Both Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., returned from the meeting vowing to charge ahead with a vote, even without public assurances from the Freedom Caucus. The leaders were desperate to move quickly because they feared there could be GOP absences later in the week.",
      "Ultimately, some of the anti-spending hawks who were skeptical of the bill, including Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., voted for the bill.",
      "\u201cAm I happy with the deficits? No,\" Norman told reporters after the vote. \"We held it out as long as we could to get the cuts, as long as we could. We couldn\u2019t do it. We live to fight another day.\u201d",
      "Democrats repeatedly blasted Republicans for debating and passing the bill \u201cunder the cover of darkness,\u201d and warned that the deep spending cuts would boot millions of Americans off the Medicaid rolls.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s what it will mean for the American people,\u201d Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D.N-Y., said in a speech before the vote. \u201cChildren will get hurt. Women will get hurt. Older Americans who rely on Medicaid for nursing home care and for home care will get hurt. People with disabilities who rely on Medicaid to survive, will get hurt. Hospitals in your districts will close. Nursing homes will shut down. And people will die.\u201d",
      "And Jeffries warned Republicans that voters would punish them in the 2026 midterm elections for supporting this bill.",
      "\u201cWhen the votes are ultimately cast on that first Tuesday in November next year,\" Jeffries said, \"this day may very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.\u201d"

      "Miley Cyrus revealed the medical condition that's behind her unique voice, and why it impacts her ability to go on tour.",
      "Cyrus shared more about her Reinke's edema diagnosis in an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe on May 21.",
      "\u201cI have the Reinke\u2019s edema, which is something that is called, it\u2019s abuse of the vocal cords,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cAnd being 21 and staying up and drinking and smoking and partying after every show does not help. But also in my case, it does not cause it. So my voice always sounded like this \u2014 it's a part of my unique anatomy.\u201d",
      "Reinke's edema, also known as polypoid corditis or vocal cord edema, is a voice disorder caused by the swelling of the vocal chords, and occurs when fluid builds up in the outer layer of the vocal chords, according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The disorder is most common in people with a long-term history of smoking, but people with chronic acid reflux, or a history of repetitive vocal trauma, like Cyrus, can also be affected.",
      "The \"Flowers\" singer went on to add that she also has a large polyp on her vocal chord, which she says has given her \"a lot of the tone and the texture\" that has made her who she is as a performer.",
      "\"But it's extremely difficult to perform with, because it's like running a marathon with ankle weights on,\" she said.",
      "Cyrus, 32, said that sometimes when she calls her mother, Tish Cyrus, at the end of the day, her mom tells her, \"Oh, you sound like you're talking through a radio.\"",
      "\"And that's how you know I'm really tired, because it creates that ultimate vocal fry,\" Cyrus said. \"And so I do have this blessing of a condition that I live with.\"",
      "Cyrus said that even though she has both Reinke's edema and the large polyp on her vocal chord, she doesn't have plans to remove the polyp.",
      "\"I'm not willing to sever it, because the chance of waking up from a surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability,\" she said.",
      "Cyrus told Lowe she plans a tour \"like every other week,\" but that her health and other factors play into her actually going on the road to perform.",
      "\"I want to do it, but it would have to be in a way that is sustainable for me in all the ways that we talked about, and then also with what I got going on,\" she said. \"Like, I don't lip sync. I sing live, and these songs are big.\"",
      "She referred to two songs on her upcoming record, \"Something Beautiful,\" which is set to drop on May 30.",
      "\"'End of the World' is a huge song, and 'More to Lose,' it's really strenuous, it's a big song. And so I don't write little songs,\" Cyrus said. \"And even if you listen to the past albums, like 'Party in the U.S.A.,' maybe, if you're in the audience and you're singing along, it's one thing, but when you've got the mic and you're performing, it's totally different.\"",
      "Cyrus also listed the logistics of traveling with a big crew, plus transporting the stage and lights, and needing to be able to play a certain amount of shows for it to \"mathematically make sense.\"",
      "\"So really, the problem for me with touring, is not only me, because this is about connecting with people around the world and using my music as a tool to heal,\" she said. \"I've always said, medicate a sick culture through these songs that I've created, or am creating. But the truth of it is is that touring, as much of it's an experience for the audience, it's a business for everybody else.\""

      "As the conclusion to \u201cSurvivor\u201d 48 began on Wednesday, May 21, there were only five castaways remaining: Eva Erickson, Kyle Fraser, Mitch Guerra, Joe Hunter and Kamilla Karthigesu.",

      "By the end of the three-hour Season 48 finale, just three castaways lasted to the Final Tribal Council: Kyle, Eva and Joe.",
      "After the jury members' votes were cast, Probst continued the divisive recent tradition of announcing the winner then and there.",
      "Kyle Fraser won \"Survivor\" 48, Probst revealed. Read on for how it all shook out.",
      "What happened during the 'Survivor' 48 finale?",
      "Following the blindside of Shauhin Davari in the penultimate episode, the final five returned to their Niu Nai camp to discuss Tribal Council. Eva and Joe thanked Kyle for tipping them off that Shauhin had turned on them, not realizing that Kyle and Kamilla concocted a plan to trick the duo into eliminating Shauhin.",
      "Kyle pointed out in his confessional that he was in a good spot, with the option of either sticking beside his strongest ally, Kamilla, or going to the final three with Eva and Joe. But, he still had more obstacles to tackle, like winning the next immunity challenge. He also worried about how Eva planned to play her hidden immunity idol.",
      "Meanwhile, Kamilla marveled at her lying abilities, adding that she planned to own all her deceptive game play if she made it to Final Tribal Council.",
      "But first, the players had to unlock a puzzle that would give them an advantage in the next challenge. Eva secured the advantage by cracking the code.",
      "At the next immunity challenge, which also included a pasta-filled reward, Probst welcomed the final five and explained that Eva's advantage allowed her to skip one of the ball toss sections. But despite the leg up, Kamilla pulled off the victory in a \u201cmassive comeback,\u201d as the host said.",
      "After Kamilla secured her spot in the final four, the other finalists had multiple conversations to decide who would join the jury as the next castaway voted out of \u201cSurvivor\" 48. Although the obvious choice seemed to be to get rid of Joe, Kamilla and Kyle contemplated eliminating Mitch instead. They were convinced that Mitch could make a better pitch to the jury if he made it to the end of the game.",
      "So when the second-to-last Tribal Council began, Mitch was a sitting duck. Kyle directly told Probst that Mitch's name was tossed around at camp. Mitch became emotional as he said it \"sucked\" knowing his game was over. But, he said he didn't have any regrets.",
      "With Mitch getting his torch snuffed, the final four journeyed to the Niu Nai camp, again, and celebrated.",
      "The next morning, the final four watched the sunrise together. In her confessional, Eva said she would take Joe to the end despite him being a strong competitor. Kamilla had a different plan for her other half in the game. She told Kyle she would select him to make fire against Joe. Kyle agreed with her thinking. As for Joe, he wanted to go to the end with Eva.",
      "For the final immunity challenge, Probst said the final four would have to\u00a0participate in a \"Survivor\" \"classic.\" The ball challenge, called \"Simmotion,\" which has appeared in multiple past seasons, required concentration and hand-eye coordination.",
      "After a close battle with Joe, Kyle became the last \u201cSurvivor\" 48 contestant to have the immunity necklace placed around his neck. He was also tasked with choosing which castaway would automatically join him in the finale, thus confirming the other two would have to participate in the fire-making challenge.",
      "Kyle upheld a promise he made before the challenge and told Joe he was taking him to the final three, meaning Eva and Kamilla had to make fire. While prepping for the challenge, Eva became overwhelmed. Joe offered to take her spot, but she declined. So, he sat with her and shared some tips to improve her fire-making skills.",
      "Before facing off, the jury looked stunned to learn that Kyle chose Joe. Each player then sat at their respective stations and began building their fires. Eva easily pulled off the victory, cementing her spot in the final three, as Kamilla struggled to get anything going.",
      "On Day 26, the last day of the season, Kyle, Joe and Eva enjoyed their breakfast feast as viewers heard the jury \u2014 Cedrek McFadden, Chrissy Sarnowsky, David Kinne, Star Toomey, Mary Zheng, Shauhin, Mitch and Kamilla \u2014 share what they hoped to hear at Final Tribal Council.",
      "As the sun set, Eva, Kyle and Joe made their way to Probst, ready to be grilled by the eliminated cast members.",
      "Probst advised them, \"Own your game and claim your victory,\" before the questions began.",
      "Multiple secrets were spilled, including Kyle revealing his true occupation as a lawyer and his undercover partnership with Kamilla.",
      "For their final pitches, Kyle said he was the most well-rounded player because he built strong relationships and played in the middle all season long. Joe spoke about being a 45-year-old firefighter and needing the money to take care of his family. Eva said  there has never been a player like her on the show and that she \"embodied\" the season by being \"unprecedented.\"",
      "After the votes were cast, Probst revealed that Kyle won, receiving five votes. Eva had two and Joe had one, marking a rare occasion in which all three finalists received votes at Final Tribal Council.",
      "All the jury members congratulated Kyle, and he toasted his fellow \"Survivor\" cast members with champagne."

      "\u201cI see it at the beginning. I always know my beginning scene,\u201d Flynn says. \"I pictured it with \u2018Gone Girl \u2014 a man coming home to a house and the door is wide open, and that moment of feeling like, \u2018Why is the door wide open?\u2019\u201d",
      "As a self-proclaimed true crime fanatic, Flynn says her initial scenario invoked fear around, \u201cWhat would it be like to have your spouse mysteriously disappear? And everyone says, \u2018It\u2019s always the husband.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd you cannot not look guilty. Because if you\u2019re crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s putting on a show.\u2019 And if you\u2019re not crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s a freak.\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cSo, you know, I started playing with that from there.\u201d",
      "For any book Flynn writes, be it her 2006 debut \"Sharp Objects\" or 2012's \u201cGone Girl,\u201d the plot unfolds as she gets inside her characters' heads.",
      "This means Flynn reaches the story's end nearly at the same point the reader does \u2014 but she gets to choose how the characters are remembered in their final moments on the page.",
      "For \u201cGone Girl,\u201d Flynn says the twisted ending readers now know didn\u2019t always exist. Instead, she tells TODAY.com how the book originally painted characters Amy and Nick.",
      "\u201cThere was the one (ending) I was originally going to go with \u2014 that you didn\u2019t know that Amy had framed Nick until the very end, so you didn\u2019t meet Amy at all,\u201d Flynn says, explaining that the draft's entire story was \u201call Nick\u2019s point of view as he\u2019s bouncing around, looking more and more guilty.\u201d",
      "In this end of the story, which \u201cno one read\u201d aside from Flynn, the reader would have discovered Amy framed the man they\u2019d been following for the entire novel, naturally prompting more sympathy for Nick.",
      "\u201cAnd then I started thinking, \u2018Who is this woman who did all this stuff?\u2019 I kept getting obsessed with, \u2018Who would do this?\u2019 And so then I was like, \u2018I need Amy in this story. I can\u2019t hide her until then. That\u2019s no fun,\u2019\u201d Flynn says.",
      "As readers know, Amy became the focal point of the page-turner. But Flynn wrote other endings, too.",
      "\u201cI had the Ozark grifters come back into (Amy\u2019s) life at the end and frame her,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cI did have one ending where she was going to go to jail and that lasted for a day, literally. I was like, \u2018She would never go to jail. Amy would never go to jail.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cI always say, I write character studies and themes, and I hide it all inside the chocolate of a juicy mystery, so that I can get people to read it,\u201d she says.",

      "This interview has been edited.",
      "How did you decide to make the move into publishing with Gillian Flynn Books?",
      "It started with Molly Stern, who was my publisher during \u201cGone Girl,\u201d asking me if I'd be interested in an imprint.",

But I realized I could create my own mission statement and could make sure there were voices getting out there who weren't just copying whatever previous popular book was, falling into a pre-arranged shape or done only by people who already have platform.",
      "I find a really dangerous trend, that this current market is really squashing out the kind of voices that I love, which are the quirky, weird, off kilter, not easy to put inside a box.",
      "The current series that I\u2019m publishing, Margot Douaihy\u2019s series, is about a punk rock former addict nun who is totally tattooed and solves mysteries in New Orleans. Or Stacy Horn\u2019s nonfiction book, \u201cThe Killing Fields of East New York,\u201d is all about white collar crime and how it decimated a community. These are things that aren\u2019t necessarily going to get snapped up immediately. And I wanted to give that voice.",
      "Was it intentional that all the authors you've published so far have been female?",
      "It is not. It has just happened to be the ones that have come to me that I really, really love. It has not been an intentional thing, but it has been the ones so far that have really drawn me.",
      "Would you agree the audience predominantly consuming crime and thriller storylines are women? Why do you think that is?",
      "I think women are more acquainted with fear than men are. We live with it as part of our everyday. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t obsess you or control you too much, but I don\u2019t know any woman who doesn\u2019t, in the very back of her mind go, \u2018\" could walk out the door and if I walk down the wrong corner, if I stay out too late, if I get in the wrong place, something really, really bad could happen to me.\" I don\u2019t know very many women who haven\u2019t had some sort of close up moment that made them a little frightened. I mean, we all carry that with us.",
      "I think the crime genre, when it\u2019s done right, really can touch on that issue and give us a vocabulary and a means to talk about it, and give us almost a way to purge that fear a little bit \u2014 understanding that it\u2019s out there and that I\u2019m not crazy. Sometimes you have that moment of, like, \u2018\"m I crazy to be nervous in this situation? Is it me?\" And the answer is f------ better safe than sorry.",
      "Writing wise, what are you working on right now?",
      "I\u2019m working on a lot, writing wise. Most of it is screenplay stuff. Ever since I did adapted \u201cGone Girl\u201d for the screen, I\u2019ve been really attracted to screenwriting and creating film and TV. And that\u2019s largely because I grew up in a household where my mom taught reading and my dad taught film. And so, to me, they\u2019re both equally viable ways of telling a story.",
      "The one I\u2019m most excited about is adapting \u201cDark Places,\" my second book, for HBO. It's not official yet, but fingers crossed.",
      "I\u2019ve told myself that after I get these couple projects done, that I\u2019m going to shut down that part for a little bit and just finish this book I\u2019m writing. It\u2019s daunting writing a book after \u201cGone Girl.\u201d You have the demons on your shoulder going, \u201cIs this too much like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019? Is it not enough like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019?\u201d",
      "What is your initial writing process like?",
      "I write in my head all the time. I can\u2019t turn it off. I was writing something in my head on the way to work today, on the way to the office, that is not going to go anywhere. It was just something I was thinking about, like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a great line. What is that? Where\u2019s that line go?\u201d It\u2019s describing a character or describing a moment or scenery.",
      "One of the walls in my office is a whiteboard. It's got whiteboard wallpaper just entirely on it, which is fantastic for a writer. But it looks like the scribblings of a mad woman because I just write different ideas for different projects. People will look at it and it really does look like a crazy person because it's all over.",
      "Do you still write down those random ideas?",
      "Yeah. I\u2019ll probably never remember where it\u2019s at or to look at it. But every once in a while I do go like, \u201cAh, I wrote that down somewhere.\u201d But I\u2019m like, \u201cDid I write in my email? Did I write on my wall. Is it in a notebook?\u201d",
      "What does the rewriting process look like for you?",
      "I loop around and rewrite a little bit as I go. But my aim is generally to get a crappy first draft. And that's what I would tell anyone who wants to be a writer because you're never going to know what's wrong with your story until you have a really crappy first draft. And then don't be afraid of it. You can go back and see what's wrong.",
      "Then I rewrite and I rewrite and I rewrite. I mean, I love rewriting. That's when I get happy. That's my happy spot. Though, writing the actual opening draft is terrifying \u2014 and it's suspenseful because you really don't know where you're going.",
      "At what point do you let people read?",
      "Not until it\u2019s done. Third or fourth draft. I want to make sure that I\u2019m writing the book I want to write. I think you give it to people early on, and they\u2019re telling you, \u201cOh, I could do this.\u201d Even if you really respect them, and it\u2019s a great idea, it\u2019s not what I want. It\u2019s really hard to get to a point where you say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to you to tell me what I should do here.\u201d",
      "So I figure it all out. I get it in really, really good shape. And then I give it to my husband, first and foremost. He\u2019s an amazing reader and editor, basically. And then I give it to a very small circle of friends \u2014 very small, like, two.",
      "Have you ever made major changes after hearing feedback?",
      "I will admit, I give it to people and I change very little afterwards. I\u2019ll listen, though. My husband will say something like, \u201cThis scene is cool. It goes on a little long.\u201d OK, yeah.",
      "I take it back \u2014 for \u201cDark Places,\u201d he did give me some criticism. I made big changes on that one. But for the most part, it\u2019s more, \u201cThis seemed to go on too long. Make your point. Should I move along from this?\u201d That sort of thing.",
      "Do you have any advice for writers navigating the world of publishing right now?",
      "Whatever you do, don't chase what seems popular right now. It's very tempting. It may pay off, but you're still always going to be the knockoff of someone else. You're going to be the, \"If you like so and so, you'll like this person.\" And how much do you want to be that? Do you want to have your own voice? That's why you're writing. So even though the market is tighter, the great voices do get found. It may take a little longer, but it's about unique, interesting, great writing.",
      "When I did \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d we got rejected quite a bit. At that time, it was sort of strange. People always said women don\u2019t want to read about dark women, and we proved that wrong. Might take more. Might take a little longer. But it\u2019ll get there if you have a bold and unique voice. Those are the ones that usually make it through the clutter of all the imitators.",

      "Along with her husband Scott, Hamlin flew into New York City just to see Willie speak with his friend Garten at City Winery at Pier 57.",
      "\u201cShe made me feel like I could actually cook,\u201d Sara says of the Barefoot Contessa, adding that she regularly makes her roast chicken recipe. \u201cIt\u2019s a bucket list for me to be here to see two of my favorite people. We\u2019ve never seen her in person before.\u201d",
      "And the Hamlins aren\u2019t the only far-flung fans to make the trip to the event.",

      "\u201cNails it!\u201d Simeon Pappas, her husband, chimes in. \u201cWhen she makes that, there\u2019s no chicken left at the end between the two of us, not when we have five friends over, either.\u201d",
      "Other folks in attendance from Dallas, Texas, San Diego, California and other stretches of the U.S. dressed to the nines in sparkly skirt-sets, pearl-embroidered collars, Garten-esque scarves and denim to see the woman who personifies simple comfort, at least according to Tina Fey on \u201c30 Rock.\u201d",
      "Fans from as far as Canada made the journey to see Willie and Garten chat and do a short cooking demo, too \u2014 a kind of dedication that our host finds thrilling.",
      "\u201cIt still blows me away,\u201d Willie tells TODAY.com backstage. \u201cThese people out there feel strongly and passionately about our show, so let\u2019s bring them into the room.\u201d",
      "Garten walked onstage to Eartha Kitt\u2019s \u201cC\u2019est Si Bon\u201d to an audience of more than 500 fans, who gave the francophile a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cLove the music,\u201d Garten said with a smile.",
      "\u201cYes, right? Little French music for Ina,\u201d Willie replied, to laughter from everyone in the room.",

      "\u201cThe list of people who sort of make the pilgrimage to your barn is amazing,\u201d Willie said, before asking if she had a dream guest. The crowd listened in rapt attention \u2014 and Garten didn\u2019t hesitate with her answer.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d she said to cheers and applause.",
      "Garten and Swift have become close over the years, sharing mutual admiration. The cookbook author has previously shared that she first met the 14-time Grammy winner at TODAY. Later, their budding friendship was cemented when Food Network Magazine asked musicians who their favorite Food Network cooks were.",
      "\u201cTaylor chose me, which was so sweet,\u201d Garten said.",
      "Garten added that Swift has been to the barn \u2014 the Contessa\u2019s nickname for her East Hampton home \u2014 about 10 years ago, and they spent time in her kitchen.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t wanna just stand there and take pictures of her,\u201d Garten said with a chuckle. \u201cI wanted to cook with her.\u201d",

      "\u201cA friend of mine said, \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound like Taylor Swift, that sounds like a Ukrainian grandmother,\u2019\u201d Garten said to laughter. \u201cI was, like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re not gonna make any of those things.\u2019\u201d",
      "Instead, Garten decided to make pavlova. Her recipe tosses blueberries, raspberries and strawberries in a framboise-spiked berry sauce over a big meringue base.",

      "Last month, family members who celebrated his birthday with McElhenney confided they, too, were interested in a name change.",

      "The movie is also the directorial debut of Scarlett Johansson, who called Squibb \u201camazing\u201d and \u201clegendary\u201d in an interview with TODAY in 2024.",
      "In a room full of stars at the festival, Squibb was the center of attention, The Daily Beast noted, describing her as \"the biggest deal at Cannes.\"",
      "Squibb is a stage veteran who made her film debut in 1990 at 61. In 2014, she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in \u201cNebraska,\u201d a movie that brought her to the Cannes red carpet for the first time and also garnered a standing ovation.",

      "Squibb had a great time doing her own stunts in \u201cThelma,\u201d including riding an electric scooter. Her portrayal of a grandmother determined to track down the criminals who scam her out of $10,000 earned her comparisons to an action hero.",
      "Defy aging stereotypes",

      "She keeps her mind engaged by being social and challenging her brain.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of it, just keeping involved with people and work. I think that is a part of why my mind is still going. And I do puzzling, I do sudoku, I do crossword, and I think all of that helps,\u201d Squibb said.",

      "For over 10 seasons, \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d has delved into celebrities\u2019 family trees \u2014\u00a0and one woman has been behind many of the shocking discoveries, unearthed secrets and tear-jerking revelations.",
      "Genetic genealogist CeCe Moore, who joined the show in its second season, produces family trees that span centuries and solves difficult family mysteries using a mixture of genetics and historical research. Moore also founded DNA Detectives, which helps people connect with their biological families \u2014 no \"Finding Your Roots\" needed.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Moore explained that much of her work doesn\u2019t make the episode. Each \u201cBook of Life\u201d takes hundreds of hours to create. The show tapes Gates\u2019 presentation of the book for about four hours \u2014 and the final edit is a fraction of that.",
      "Below, Moore shares more notable discoveries throughout her decade on \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "Henry Louis Gates Jr.",
      "Gates simultaneously asked Moore to work on his family secret that he\u2019d learned about at age nine, which Moore would be tasked with working on for the next decade. It culminated in one of the most satisfying \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d discoveries for Moore in the show\u2019s history, causing Gates to tear up during the filming while Moore hosted in Gates\u2019 place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so meaningful because his original family mystery is really what sparked all of this,\u201d Moore told TODAY.com in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if finding your roots would even exist if he hadn\u2019t been so intrigued with that mystery.\u201d",
      "The findings of the mystery, uncovered in the season 11 finale of the show, revealed the life surrounding Gates\u2019 great-great-grandmother Jane Gates, uncovering the husband of Jane Gates as well as estate papers showing her listed in slave records along with her two sons.",
      "Moore, who spent over a decade working on the project, learned the identity of Gates\u2019 great-great-grandfather Charles Wesley Kelly in 2017 thanks to the growth of public DNA databases online. Despite finding the identity of Kelly, she wanted to provide Gates with a full spectrum of information on his family tree.",
      "\u201cTrying to give my friend and my colleague information that would be valuable and meaningful to him, it was pretty daunting,\u201d Moore laughs.",
      "The result was worth the wait; Moore uncovered over 300 of Jane Gates\u2019 descendants who gathered for a Gates family reunion, a full-circle moment for the \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d host.",
      "LL Cool J",
      "In a 2016 episode of \u201cFinding Your Roots,\u201d rapper and actor LL Cool J, born James Todd Smith, appeared on the show to discuss his family\u2019s roots.",
      "When Moore examined the rapper\u2019s mother\u2019s DNA, she realized his mother\u2019s DNA did not match any predecessors on the family tree.",
      "Moore later discovered LL Cool J\u2019s mother, Ondrea Griffith, was adopted, meaning that the rapper was not related to his grandparents.",
      "LL Cool J was raised in his grandparents\u2019 house after his father, James Nunya, shot his mother and grandfather. Though they both survived, LL Cool J found the two wounded on the floor, a traumatic experience for the rapper, which he wrote about in his memoir.",
      "\u201cThat was tremendously concerning, because it\u2019s not something we would surprise him with on camera. That would not be kind,\u201d Moore recalls about the discovery.",
      "Ahead of filming, Gates called LL Cool J to see if he wanted to proceed, as is the show\u2019s policy. He insisted he wanted to discuss it on camera, and his mother agreed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little devastating to know that the guy that raised me, the guy that was so kind to me, wasn\u2019t my blood,\u201d LL Cool J said during the episode.",
      "Moore compared Griffith\u2019s DNA to a database of millions of available samples and found a match with a half sister named Claudia Lewis, sharing 24.7% matching DNA, which led to the discovery of LL Cool J\u2019s biological grandfather, Nathaniel Christy Lewis.",
      "Moore also discovered LL Cool J\u2019s maternal grandmother, a woman named Ethel Mae Jolly, quickly learning that Jolly was still alive in her late 80s.",
      "Moore told TODAY.com that LL Cool J and his mom ended up meeting Jolly, saying that the rapper took his grandmother \u201cunder his wing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey ended up really bonding and becoming close, and it made a huge difference for both LL Cool J\u2019s mother and her mother,\u201d Moore says, \u201cThat was the first really significant DNA story that was on the show.\u201d",
      "Looking back, Moore says \u201cadoptees really gained a lot from watching that episode.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought it was very compassionate that he and his mom decided to go ahead and let the public share in that discovery,\u201d she continues.",
      "Joe Manganiello",
      "Moore says actor Joe Manganiello \"has the richest, most varied, intricate family history\" she's ever worked on.",
      "During the episode, Manganiello discovered his great-grandfather was a German soldier, unearthed what his family endured during the Armenian genocide and learned he had Black ancestry.",
      "Manganiello\u2019s great-grandmother on his mother\u2019s side, Terviz \u201cRose\u201d Darakjian, was a survivor of the Armenian genocide. Nearly all of her family was killed, including her husband, parents and seven of her eight children.",
      "Using DNA evidence, Moore discovered Manganiello's grandmother became pregnant by a German soldier in a refugee camp after fleeing during the Armenian genocide.",
      "Then, on his father's side, DNA evidence revealed that Manganiello showed no genetic relation to the man he assumed to be his father\u2019s father. Manganiello\u2019s father had no idea he was not raised by his biological father, but agreed to share the findings on the PBS show.",
      "Manganiello eventually learned his biological paternal grandfather was of African American descent.",
      "Moore says that the countless discoveries made in the episode inspired Mangianello to continue research after the show, the first guest to become invested in genealogy afterwards.",
      "\u201cHe talked at one point like, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll quit being an actor and I\u2019ll become a genetic genealogist.\u2019 That\u2019s how much he loved it,\u201d Moore says"

      "The Chicago native appeared multiple times in the recurring \u201cDa Bears\u201d sketch on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d in which a group of blindly devoted Chicago Bears fans, decked out in Bears gear, dark sunglasses and thick mustaches, discuss the team on a talk show, with many conversations punctuated by them saying \u201cDa Bears!\u201d in a thick Chicago accent.",
      "Officially known as \u201cBill Swerski\u2019s Super Fans,\u201d the sketch was a staple of \u201cSNL\u201d in the early 1990s, featuring the actors making outlandish predictions that the Bears will win games by completely unrealistic scores, their confidence oozing like the juices from the kielbasa they scarf down on the daily.",
      "Wendt, as Bob Swerski, would open the sketch, with cigar in hand, by casually announcing he\u2019s filling in for his brother, Bill, who suffered another heart attack. The panelists, of course, are surrounded by artery-clogging foods on the table around them; a heart attack is as natural a byproduct as quenching their thirst with a beer after eating the caloric explosion of cuisine set before them.",
      "Joined by Robert Smigel \u2014 who created the sketch \u2014 Mike Myers and Chris Farley, the quartet live on the fringe of reality. They believe nothing is better than the Bears and no one is better than their then-head coach, Mike Ditka. They speak as if their love for all things Chicago is fact.",

      "\u201c\u2018Da Bears,\u2019\u201d everyone else says while raising their mugs of beer.",
      "In another episode, the crew quickly discusses how many heart attacks they had that week before guest host Macaulay Culkin reenacts the first Thanksgiving, which somehow features his absurd pick for how badly the Bears will beat the Lions when they play during the holiday.",
      "Smigel came up with the premise of the sketch after seeing fans at Chicago Cubs games and Chicago White Sox games after he moved to the Windy City in the early 1980s.",
      "\u201cThey just had this swagger to them and I just, in my head, I was like, \u2018Da Bears!\u2019\u201d Smigel once told Antenna TV.",
      "\u201cThere was just a swagger among these very virile-looking men,\u201d he told The Ringer in 2018. \u201cAll sports fans kind of have it. The arrogance of, \u2018We kicked your ass!\u2019 No, you didn\u2019t. You\u2019re a fat guy sitting in the third row. You can barely make it to the bathroom with all the beers you\u2019ve drunk. You didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d",
      "Joe Mantegna appeared in the sketch the first time it aired. Wendt would step in for the second sketch later in 1991, a point in which Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their run of six NBA titles that decade. That marked a turning point for the sketch.",
      "\u201cAfter Wendt joined in, the Super Fans were officially recurring characters,\u201d wrote The Ringer. \u201cThat summer at a\u00a0Comic Relief event\u00a0in Chicago, the group appeared in a sketch with Michael Jordan.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what led to him feeling comfortable hosting\u00a0\u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019\u201d Smigel told the website. Indeed, Jordan did host the show\u2019s 17th-season premiere in September 1991.",
      "The sketch was a stalwart in the \u201890s, but lived on in the years afterward, too, with Wendt reprising his role on multiple occasions.",
      "Sports and \u201cSNL\u201d have a storied history, and Wendt may have played a small role in the show\u2019s 50-year history, as well as more modern history. After Chicago native Robert Prevost was elected the new pope and became Pope Leo XIV earlier this month, the hashtag #DaPope popped up on X.",

      "Perhaps unsurprisingly, this game ended in tears \u2014 lots of them.",
      "Demi Engemann, who was in the middle of a lengthy battle with infertility at the time, picked out a positive pregnancy test that belonged to one of the other women. Holding the positive test that she'd yearned for but never gotten, she burst into heartbroken sobs.",
      "Cast members and viewers have been rallying to her side, even though Engemann emerged as the \"villain\" elsewhere in the series.",
      "\"Every single one of us is a mom in that room, and we could all feel her pain because she wants this so badly,\" cast member Whitney Leavitt tells TODAY.com. \"You could just feel the energy in the room, like, 'We feel it. We\u2019re here for you. We get it.'\"",
      "\u201cI just thought it would be a fun little game,\u201d says Layla Taylor, who instigated the game. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t really have any hunches that anyone was pregnant or anything like that, and I didn\u2019t think that Demi would have the reaction that she did.\u201d",

We're going to play pregnancy roulette!\" she said. (Taylor's period was late so rather than taking a test in private, she decided to make everyone take a test in the most public way possible.)",
      "\"This is a cruel prank because what if someone is and it's not me?\" Demi Engemann, who had been struggling with infertility for four years, said before playing the game. \"This isn't traumatic at all. I don't cry every single time I take a test and get a negative,\" she added sarcastically.",
      "In a confessional interview, Engemann said, \"I feel like I'm going to throw up. It's evoking all of these emotions in me and triggering me to my core. My least favorite thing to do is take a pregnancy test.\"",
      "Yet for some reason, all of the women agreed to play the game.",
      "Taylor and Mayci Neely happened to grab tests with negative results. Mikayla Matthews selected a pregnancy test that happened to be positive. But none of the women confessed to being pregnant. Then it was Engemann's turn to select a pregnancy test from the bowl.",
      "When she spotted the result, Engemann gasped, took a huge step back, covered her face with her arm and began to sob. The test was positive. But she knew it wasn't hers.",
      "In a confessional interview, Engemann described how unsettling it was to look at a positive pregnancy test.",
      "Though she asked for the pregnant women to reveal themselves, Matthews and Neely (who had previously announced their pregnancies on social media) remained silent.",
      "This situation was \"the exact opposite\" of how Neely said she wanted to reveal her pregnancy to the group.",
      "\"This is also my moment that I don't want to be taken away from me, and I also want to be sensitive to how (Demi is) feeling,\" Matthews said.",
      "Engemann's \"frenemy\" on the show, Jessi Ngatikaura, consoled her as she sobbed. Eventually Matthews and Neely joined the pair and confessed that they were pregnant. Engemann ended up apologizing for her negative reaction to their positive tests.",
      "In her press interview, Taylor tells TODAY.com that she spent time with Engemann afterward to try to console her, but the scene was edited out of the final episode.",
      "\"They didn't show me in the bathroom, both of us crying and me consoling her and being like, 'I'm so sorry that this just happened. I feel awful. I'm so, so sorry,\" Taylor explains. \"A lot of things are definitely taken out of context.\""

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world, Sammy, and I\u2019m wearing Milk Bone underwear,\u201d he casually responds as he saunters to his bar stool.",

      "\u201cGeorge Wendt entered for the first time and said, \u2018Afternoon, everybody!\u2019\u201d \u201cCheers\u201d co-creator and longtime director, James Burrows, wrote in his 2022 book, \u201cDirected by James Burrows.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, everybody yelled back, \u2018Norm!\u2019 Then Teddy said, \u2018What do you know?\u2019 And George said, \u2018Not enough.\u2019\u201d",
      "In that moment, a recurring bit was born.",
      "\u201cIt was really a straight line in the script, but it got this huge laugh from the audience,\u201d Burrows continued. \u201cI turned to my two partners and said, \u2018Wow, they\u2019re laughing not only at this joke but they\u2019re laughing at this character, the person saying it.\u2019 Right then I had a sense that we had something special.\u201d",
      "\u201cCheers,\u201d which was nominated for a staggering 117 Emmy Awards and won 28, never lost its luster over its 11-year run, even as cast changes challenged its dynamic. \u201cNorm!\u201d was a constant, a warm blanket for viewers looking for laughs.",
      "\u201cNorm!\u201d became a signature greeting that Burrows said was created by Nicholas Colasanto, who played Coach on the show before his death prior to the fourth season. It was simple, effective and eventually, daunting to write.",
      "\u201cWe wound up with ten of the greatest seconds of sitcom history each week, every time Norm walked in and made a joke,\u201d Burrows wrote. \u201cThe Norm\u2019isms \u2014 the interchange when Norm walks into the bar in each episode \u2014 became harder and harder to write, because the audience expected so much.\u201d",
      "\u201cCheers\u201d was an escape from the daily travails and aggravation of life. Norm was the poster child.",
      "\u201cEvery character wanted something or had some kind of problem, except for Norm, who was wonderful and essential in a different way, because he was the anchor for the group,\u201d Burrows wrote. \u201cBecause Norm was relatively happy and well-adjusted, everything was fine.\u201d",
      "Wendt\u2019s portrayal of Norm earned him six Emmy nominations, although he never won. It was a career-defining role for a man who took to comedy the way Norm took to beer. He enjoyed other success, including a recurring role on \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch.\u201d He also appeared in his own short-lived series, \u201cThe George Wendt Show,\u201d and had multiple uncredited appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in the popular \u201cSuper Fans\u201d sketches, which wrought the phrase \u201cDa Bears!\u201d in the early 1990s.",
      "He even had supporting roles in \u201880s movies such as \u201cFletch\u201d and \u201cGung Ho\u201d and once even shared a screen with Macaulay Culkin in Michael Jackson\u2019s heavily hyped video for \u201cBlack or White.\u201d He was  also the uncle to comedy star Jason Sudeikis.",
      "Wendt was just plain funny, a linchpin in a \u201cCheers\u201d cast that was a linchpin in NBC\u2019s vaunted Thursday night lineup that featured hits like \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d \u201cFamily Ties\u201d and \u201cNight Court.\u201d There are no words to explain how valuable he was \u2014 except one: Norm."

      "Aid workers struggling to distribute a trickle of aid entering the besieged Gaza Strip are describing a logistical \u201cnightmare\u201d in the midst of a spiraling humanitarian crisis.",
      "\u201cWith this limited amount of aid, the humanitarian situation continues to get worse and worse,\u201d Dr. Amjad Alshawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, an umbrella group of Palestinian organizations, told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cAt the same time, the Israelis are imposing restrictions on access to these supplies.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said humanitarian workers were able to pick up at least 90 truckloads of aid Wednesday night \u2014 but it was unclear whether that aid had been distributed as of Thursday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground described widespread frustration among Palestinians waiting to see whether more aid will flow into the enclave. Many charities have stopped or reduced their food offerings because of the scarcity of supplies and high cost of the rare goods available at markets.",
      "After lifting its almost three-month-long blockade of the entry of food, medicine and other aid into Gaza, Israel has allowed a trickle of supplies into the enclave in recent days amid mounting international pressure. Aid groups say it has also imposed a new set of rules on bringing in supplies, which they blame for logistical snarl-ups and a delay in food and medicine reaching those who need it.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military\u2019s liaison with the Palestinians, said Thursday that 198 trucks had entered Gaza, but did not specifically comment on the new procedures and referred NBC News to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for further comment, which it did not immediately provide.",
      "COGAT data suggested the majority of that aid has been food, with medicine and medical equipment making up a smaller share.",
      "Humanitarian groups have warned that the limited aid flowing in is a fraction of the amount needed, with an average of around 500 trucks a day entering in Gaza before the war, according to the British Red Cross.",
      "Despite that resumption, little if any aid entering Gaza had reached Palestinian civilians as of late Wednesday, with humanitarian groups saying that new procedures introduced by Israel have complicated an already tangled effort.",
      "Logistical 'nightmare'",
      "In a briefing Wednesday, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that in one instance, the rules meant that, \u201cIsraeli authorities had only allowed our teams to go through one area that was highly congested, that we felt was insecure and where we felt looting was highly likely to take place, given the prolonged deprivation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "While Israeli authorities have not specifically laid out what the new rules involve, Dujarric said Tuesday that humanitarian workers were being required to offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and then reload them separately once teams inside Gaza were allowed to collect them.",
      "He noted that one team waited \"several hours\" for such a green light, but were never able to transport the goods.",
      "Meanwhile, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, has found many of its trucks \u201cblocked for reasons that are sometimes unknown,\u201d its head of mission for the Palestinian Territories, Jean Guy Vataux, told NBC News in Jerusalem late Wednesday.",
      "While he added that some of the new procedures were \u201cput in place to avoid smuggling,\u201d the new system \u201cturns into a logistic nightmare for the agencies.\u201d",
      "'Malnutrition is growing'",
      "Meanwhile, \"malnutrition is growing\" in Gaza, Vataux said.",
      "An Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, report released earlier this month warned of the risk of famine if adequate access to food was not restored.",
      "The IPC snapshot warned that some 470,000 people in Gaza were facing \u201ccatastrophic hunger,\u201d while the entire population was experiencing food insecurity, the World Food Programme said. It further projected that an \u201calarming 71,000 children and more than 17,000 mothers\u201d would need \u201curgent treatment for acute malnutrition.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. clarified comments from its humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who had said some 14,000 babies were at risk of death within a short time frame. The body said that the same number of babies is facing severe malnutrition absent a significant and swift increase of aid into Gaza, with severe malnutrition posing the risk of death."

      "After maulings for Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and King Abdullah of Jordan, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa may have just shown other world leaders how to prepare for President Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office bear pit.",
      "Historically, these White House sit-downs were dull affairs, replete with grip-and-grin platitudes and geopolitical jargon. Not so during the second term of Trump, who has transformed his office into a gladiatorial arena.",
      "There was February\u2019s stunning bust-up by Vice President JD Vance against Zelenskyy. The same month, Abdullah could not hide his chagrin as Trump spoke at length about his plans to take control of the Gaza Strip.",
      "So, South Africa's Ramaphosa seemed unsurprised when Trump ambushed him Wednesday \u2014 the U.S. president even dimmed the lights for a screening of news clips alleging that white farmers are victims of a genocide in South Africa.",
      "Most experts agree this is a false, baseless claim, seized upon by Trump since employing as an adviser the South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, who was in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible sight \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Trump commentated while the footage played.",
      "Unlike other leaders, Ramaphosa \u2014 a former trade union leader and ally of Nelson Mandela who helped end apartheid \u2014 was clearly prepared. He spoke calmly and without interruption, politely but firmly disagreeing with Trump.",
      "\u201cIt will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends,\u201d he said, when asked what would convince the American leader he was mistaken.",
      "And there was a flourish of his own.",
      "Ramaphosa had brought with him Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, two white South African golfers who are both in the Hall of Fame and have won six U.S. Open titles between them.",
      "At a meeting alongside the golf-fanatic Trump, the intention behind the maneuver was unmistakable.",
      "\u201cIf there was Afrikaner farmer genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen would not be here,\u201d the South African leader said in the Oval Office, pointing to the white members of his entourage that also included John Steenhuisen, his agriculture minister. \u201cIt will take him, President Trump, listening to their stories, to their perspective.\u201d",
      "Whereas the Zelenskyy fiasco caught \u201ceveryone off guard with its intensity and its destructiveness,\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cplanned attack\u201d on Ramaphosa \u201ctook the stakes up a level,\u201d said Scott Lucas, a politics professor at Ireland\u2019s University College Dublin.",
      "\u201cRamaphosa seemed to have been very well briefed and he kept his cool,\u201d he said. \u201cLeaders around the world now have a playbook for how they deal with Trump.\u201d",
      "This is not to say other leaders have not had similar successes already.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer unfurled from his breast pocket a letter from King Charles III when he came to town in February \u2014 a gambit mocked back in Britain for being sycophantic, but one that seemed to go down well with Trump.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba huddled with advisers for more than 20 hours of preparatory meetings ahead of his showdown the same month, a person familiar with the planning said. That too seemed to pay off: Ishiba arrived armed with charts clearly and colorfully illustrating Japan\u2019s investments in America and the kind of visual aids that Trump prefers.",
      "Like Starmer, he played to Trump\u2019s appetite for a theatrical gift, bringing with him a golden samurai helmet, which in Japan often signifies prayers for prosperity and longevity.",
      "Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron appears to have mastered the art of keeping a rapport with Trump while maintaining a macho-style resistance to some of his statements. During his own February Oval Office sit-down, he put his hand on Trump\u2019s arm and gently corrected his mistaken statement that European countries had merely \u201cloaned\u201d money to Ukraine.",
      "Even more stern, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney kept a straight back, clenched jaw and \u2014 though often struggling to get a word in edgewise \u2014 made it clear through words and firm hand gestures that \u201cCanada is not for sale.\u201d",
      "Even against this field, Ramaphosa\u2019s poise has been widely praised.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing preparing to be ambushed and another being able to manage the situation,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "\u201cMost people seem to think that Ramaphosa came out of it well,\u201d he added. \u201cThat may also be because he has good people skills, which meant that he was better placed than some world leaders to defuse the situation.\u201d",
      "However artful a sparring partner Ramaphosa was, it's still unclear how effective his tactics will be.",
      "\u201cYou wanted to see drama and something really big happening,\u201d Ramaphosa told reporters afterward, downplaying the episode. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that we disappointed you somewhat when it comes to that.\u201d",
      "But it was still a bruising and concerning encounter for a country that dearly needs American financial help.",
      "Hours before the Oval Office meeting, South African Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said his government did not have the necessary funds to cover a $430 million shortfall caused by Trump\u2019s cuts to foreign aid.",
      "In Trump, the country faces a president who sees a \u201cperfect trifecta\u201d in the white farmer genocide claim, Patrick Gaspard, a former U.S. ambassador to South Africa, told MSNBC later Wednesday.",
      "It allows Trump \u201cto play to a domestic political audience that is obsessed with white, existential threats,\u201d while distracting from domestic economic issues and promoting Musk\u2019s attempts to get a South African license for Starlink, Gaspard said.",
      "He called the encounter not only \u201cdeeply offensive and hurtful to a partnership that we have with a really important nation in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d but also said it \u201cdoes a major disservice to that Oval Office, that sacred space.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment."

      "Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost of Chicago, began the audience with a tour through the piazza in the popemobile and stopped to bless several babies. In addressing specific greetings to different groups of pilgrims, Leo spoke in his native English, his fluent Spanish as well as the traditional Italian of the papacy.",
      "\u201cI renew my heartfelt appeal to allow the entrance of dignified humanitarian aid to Gaza and to put an end to the hostilities whose heartbreaking price is being paid by children, the elderly and sick people,\u201d he said.",
      "Leo did not mention the plight of hostages taken by Hamas during the assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, as Pope Francis normally would.",
      "The general audience on Wednesdays is a weekly appointment that popes have kept for decades to allow ordinary faithful to have a face-to-face encounter with the pontiff.

      "Trump had referred to the Vatican\u2019s longstanding offer to host talks in reporting on his phone call Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "While low-level talks could take place in Rome, Italy would be hard-pressed to allow Putin to fly into Rome for any higher-level negotiation.

      "One week after that life-changing phone call, NBC News spoke to Yael Alexander and her husband, Adi Alexander, about their son\u2019s more than a year in captivity and his eventual release.",
      "Edan Alexander, who was believed to be\u00a0the last living U.S. citizen\u00a0held captive in Gaza, was freed on May 12 after having been captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Born in Tel Aviv, Edan, 21, grew up in New Jersey but had returned to Israel to serve in the army. His parents said he recounted to them the details of his capture and his time in captivity.",
      "Attacked on his army base on Oct. 7, Edan faced off with almost 30 militants by himself before he was kidnapped, Adi Alexander said. His son called the first year in captivity \u201ccomplete hell,\u201d he said, because he was frequently moved around to various locations above ground, underground and in tents, at one point during the war living in a tent that, his father recounted, Edan said he couldn\u2019t leave for weeks.",
      "\u201cThe conditions in those tents are not easy. They couldn\u2019t get out,\u201d Adi said, noting that Edan\u2019s time in the tent was his \u201ctoughest period\u201d in captivity.",
      "Edan was in good physical shape when he was taken, whereas a number of other captives, including injured people, children and the elderly, weren\u2019t, Adi said, so Edan helped those being held with him, especially when they moved between locations.",
      "Edan endured hunger, eating only hummus, pita bread, rice and whatever his captors served him from cans, his father said, a reflection of the food scarcity in Gaza since the start of the war. Fears of famine have heightened there in recent weeks as Israel has carried out a nearly three-month blockade on the enclave \u2014\u00a0the longest of its kind since the start of the conflict.",
      "Israel said Sunday it would begin allowing limited resources to flow into the Gaza Strip to avoid a \u201chunger crisis.\u201d Worries of such a crisis aren\u2019t new, with aid groups warning about such conditions for months as a result of Israel\u2019s military operation.",
      "Food began to flow more regularly during the fragile January ceasefire brokered during the Biden administration, offering the hostages an opportunity to eat meat, Adi Alexander said. Edan told his parents conditions improved during what Adi called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of his son's captivity \u2014 after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "By then, he said, Edan, who had lost about a quarter of his body mass, stayed in one \u201csecure and safe\u201d location for the rest of his time in Gaza and was able to regain some weight.",
      "Adi lauded his son\u2019s \u201cwisdom to get along with the captors and survive,\u201d even when death from bombardments by the Israeli army \u2014 which he said Edan described as \u201clike an earthquake\u201d \u2014 seemed possible. At one point, Edan also survived a tunnel collapse, his father said.",
      "\u201cWe consider ourselves lucky that he survived that day,\u201d Adi said of the collapse. \u201cHe has some injury from that event, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something major now.\u201d",
      "Adi said he and his family were devastated when the ceasefire collapsed and \u201cthe war re-started.\u201d",
      "On May 5, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an intensive military operation aiming to take the whole of the Gaza Strip in an effort to eliminate Hamas, a move approved by the country\u2019s security Cabinet.",
      "But the plan hasn\u2019t been without pushback. A number of military reservists have rejected the call to serve in the operation, saying it is part of a war that has become politically motivated. At a Knesset committee\u00a0meeting this month, the father of one of the remaining hostages called on soldiers \u201cnot to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.\u201d",
      "More than 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, and around 250 hostages were taken, according to Israeli tallies. Fifty-eight hostages are believed to remain in captivity.",

    "story": [
      "The phone call between President Donald Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin may not have achieved great strides on ending the war in Ukraine, but it did confirm one thing: The bromance is real. But a question is left hanging: What does this bonhomie actually deliver for the men in the Kremlin and White House?",
      "\u201cThe tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent,\u201d Trump said of his Russian counterpart after their two-hour conversation Monday, adding that Putin is a \u201cnice gentleman.\u201d Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov, meanwhile, said Trump and Putin called each other by their first names and \u201cneither of them wanted to end the conversation.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Putin commissioned a portrait of his American counterpart and delivered it to him. One of Trump\u2019s envoys, Steve Witkoff, told Tucker Carlson in March that the president was \u201cclearly touched\u201d by what he called a \u201cbeautiful\u201d portrait.",
      "Trump is not just seeking an end to the war in Ukraine, which Russia started by launching its large-scale 2022 invasion; in addition, he has made no secret of his desire to do lucrative deals with a Kremlin reintroduced to the international financial fold.",
      "In April he wrote on Truth Social that he was \u201chopeful Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,\u201d adding that \u201cboth will then start to do big business with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Before that happens, Trump and his team have suggested they want the war to end, something the president has made a clear political goal, having promised during his presidential campaign that it would take just 24 hours to secure, although he later told Time magazine that this was an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d",
      "His call with Putin appears to have brought that no closer to fruition, with a chasm still aching between Ukraine\u2019s willingness for a 30-day ceasefire and Russia\u2019s demand for Kyiv\u2019s effective surrender.",
      "It\u2019s not been a total love-in between the leaders of these former Cold War foes. Trump has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart for continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "And Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the White House is not asking the Senate to hold back on a bill that would slap a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and other products.",
      "But one thing that Putin\u2019s personal connection with Trump does is buy him time, according to Mark Galeotti, director of the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "Putin has shown little desire for any sort of ceasefire that does not satisfy his maximalist goals. And right now his forces continue to make slow but steady battlefield advances in eastern Ukraine, according to independent monitors like the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank.",
      "So, with negotiations at an impasse, Putin will be more than happy to delay any definite decision \u2014 on both American support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, Galeotti said.",
      "\u201cEvery week counts\u201d in this \u201cparticularly pivotal moment,\u201d Galeotti said. If his call with Trump delays making any decisions, then \u201cI think Putin will see it as a good job done,\u201d he said.",
      "As with its lack of detail on how the war might end, the call also provided little clarity on whether or when Trump and Putin might meet in person, something they have both suggested could happen. If and when this real-world t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate does take place, it will be harder for Putin to resist giving Trump something, according to Galeotti.",
      "The Russians are \u201ctrying to avoid giving anything because they are very, very hard-nosed negotiators,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they do meet in person, then Trump will have to leave with something.\u201d",
      "While no date for a meeting between the two leaders has been set, their longtime fondness has long caused widespread alarm across the West. Intelligence agencies see Putin as a foe who has challenged international norms through hybrid warfare such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against democratic institutions.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in an email that \u201cunlike his predecessor, President Trump is willing to look anyone in the eye and negotiate deals that deliver peace.\u201d",
      "Kelly said that \u201cthanks to his leadership\u201d Russia and Ukraine \u201cwill begin ceasefire talks to stop the killing in the bloodiest European war since World War II.\u201d A date and venue for ceasefire talks has not been set.",
      "The American president\u2019s connection with Putin has roots at least as far back as 2013, when he visited Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant and pondered on Twitter whether Putin will \u201cbecome my new best friend?\u201d",
      "By 2015, before the two men had even met, Putin was heaping praise on Trump as a \u201ccolorful, talented person,\u201d something the American leader said was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d coming from the \u201chighly respected\u201d Russian leader.",
      "A year later, Trump openly urged Putin to influence the American presidential election, telling a rally in Doral, Florida, that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d This was in the eyes of many observers an overt invitation for Russian intelligence services to hack into the account of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.",
      "Putin would indeed conduct a campaign to interfere, according to a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in 2020.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the pair met on multiple occasions without any staff present, a highly unusual departure from standard protocol. But the Russian government would ultimately conclude that while the president himself was friendly, his administration was not. The Trump White House imposed sanctions and withdrew from a nuclear deal it said Russia wasn\u2019t respecting.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s second term looks like it could be a repeat.",
      "Asked about future opportunities for face-to-face diplomacy between himself Putin, Trump replied: \u201cWe have to meet. He and I will meet. I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not.\u201d"

    "summary": "Taiwan's youth are stuck. There's growing concern in Taipei over the reliability of the Trump-led U.S. as a security partner, even despite Chinese aggression.",
    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",
      "The experience was \u201ca dream come true\u201d for Chen, who said the Chinese TV industry is \u201chighly developed.\u201d She said she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in mainland China next year and that she would also consider working there.",
      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday\u2019s grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest, the world\u2019s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israel and Switzerland to come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour.",
      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",
      "Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results.",
      "Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year\u2019s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points.",
      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Raphael\u2019s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points.",
      "There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public.",
      "Sweden\u2019s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ\u2019s \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act\u2019s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels \u2014 a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday.",
      "The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties.",
      "Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956 as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries. This year, there were 37 nations taking part, whittled down to 26 finalists over two semifinals earlier this week. And the production is now a behemoth, with hundreds of crew members and 22 cameras capturing the action.",
      "The first act to perform was Kyle Alessandro, a 19-year-old from Norway, who took the stage wearing chain mail for a pyrotechnic-enhanced rendition of his entry, \u201cLighter.\u201d",
      "His song kicked off a show that included a number of memorable performances, including that of Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman, whose sexually charged \u201cIch Komme\u201d ends with her suspended in the air atop a giant microphone stand emitting sparks.",
      "Poland\u2019s Justyna Steczkowska made her return to Eurovision after 30 years with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-inspired performance that saw the 52-year-old lifted into the air by ropes as a CGI dragon swooped behind her on an 8,000-square-foot LED video wall.",
      "Some 163 million people watched the Eurovision final and the two semifinals last year. Final viewing figures are not yet available for this year\u2019s competition, but it is sure to remain one of the most-watched events in the world. It attracts more viewers than the Super Bowl, which had 123.4 million viewers last year, according to CBS.",
      "That viewership will likely see \"Wasted Love\" climb the charts across Europe. For some Eurovision winners like Dion and ABBA, international stardom awaits.",
      "Most artists aren\u2019t quite that lucky, but the massive platform means winners can see levels of fame they would otherwise only dream of.",
      "Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after winning the 2021 contest, and Dutch singer Duncan Laurence performed his winning 2019 song \u201cArcade\u201d on NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d show when it started climbing U.S. charts after going viral on TikTok.",

      "South Korea\u2019s Lee said the damaged ship was believed to have capabilities similar to those of North Korea\u2019s first destroyer, the Choe Hyon-ho, which was unveiled late last month in what Kim called a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in modernizing his naval forces. North Korean state media reported that Kim had supervised tests of the destroyer\u2019s supersonic and strategic cruise missiles, anti-aircraft missile, automatic guns and electronic jamming guns.",

      "Experts say that although North Korea\u2019s naval forces still lag behind those of South Korea, which has 12 destroyers, the new destroyer is considered a serious threat. It is believed to have been built with assistance from Russia, where North Korea has been sending troops and weapons to support its war against Ukraine.",

      "Tensions have heightened on the Korean Peninsula in recent years as Kim accelerates weapons testing for his nuclear and missile programs in what he says is a response to intensifying military cooperation between the United States and its allies. North Korea views joint military exercises among the United States, South Korea and others as a rehearsal for invasion, which those nations deny.",
      "While North Korea\u2019s cruise missile launches on Thursday did not violate United Nations Security Council resolutions, which bar the North from testing ballistic missiles, experts say they are equally as deadly."

      "London\u2019s Metropolitan Police accused Liam O\u2019Hanna, 27, who whose name in Irish is Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh and who performs as Mo Chara in the hip-hop trio Kneecap, of violating a provision in the country\u2019s terrorism law that bans people from displaying flags \u201cin such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a supporter\u201d of groups the United Kingdom considers terrorists.",
      "The Met said it launched an investigation after it learned of an online video last month that showed O\u2019Hanna displaying the flag of Hezbollah at a venue north of London on Nov. 21.",
      "Representatives for Kneecap did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday night.",
      "Hezbollah, a Shia political party and militant organization based in Lebanon, has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, the U.K. and other countries over its militant activities and its ties to Iran.",
      "The group expressed support for Hamas\u2019 attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel soon after. The conflict exploded into a war that has killed thousands of people in Lebanon and displaced tens of thousands more in Israel.",
      "After Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Kneecap\u2019s X account posted a previous interview with O\u2019Hanna in which he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be 80, 90 years of age and my grandkids asking me, 'Why did nobody do anything about the Palestinian genocide?' And me sitting there being like, 'F---, I didn\u2019t do enough.' I don\u2019t want to be on that side of history.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are clearer than ever on who we are and what we stand for,\u201d the post added.",
      "More than 53,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its bombing campaign and ground invasion after Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack, according to health officials in the enclave. The attack killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, and hundreds more were taken hostage by Hamas militants, according to Israeli tallies.",
      "After a weekslong ceasefire fell apart in March, Israel resumed its bombardment of the enclave, including a series of assaults that killed 300 people in 72 hours this month. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was \"moving toward full control\" of Gaza.",
      "Kneecap has described criticism of its outspoken views about the war in Gaza as a \"coordinated smear campaign\" by those who \"want to silence criticism of a mass slaughter. They weaponize false accusations of antisemitism to distract, confuse, and provide cover for genocide.\u201d",
      "After the group performed at Coachella last month in front of a screen that said, \u201cF--- Israel, Free Palestine,\" the organizers behind Israel's Tribe of Nova music festival, where hundreds of people were killed in the October 2023 attack, said Kneecap's messaging was \"an affront made even more painful in light of the massacre.\"",
      "\"We invite the members of Kneecap to visit the Nova Exhibition in Toronto and experience firsthand the stories of those who were murdered, those who survived, and those are still being held hostage,\" the organizers said. \"Not to shame or silence \u2014 but to connect. To witness. To understand.\"",

      "\u201cThe local companies are very, very talented and very determined,\u201d Huang said, \u201cand the export control gave them the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development.\u201d",
      "Those companies \u201cwould love for us never to go back to China,\u201d he said, adding that China is home to 50% of the world\u2019s AI researchers and has an AI market he estimated would be worth $50 billion by next year.",
      "Nvidia said last month that it would write off about $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips it had specifically designed for the China market to comply with previous curbs after the Trump administration said those chips would also be restricted.",
      "\u201cI really do hope that the U.S. government recognizes that the ban is not effective and give us a chance to go back and win the market as soon as possible,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Huang, who was with Trump on his Middle East trip last week along with other tech leaders, lauded the president for his \u201cgreat reversal\u201d of Biden\u2019s policy, known as the AI diffusion rule, saying Trump \u201crealizes it\u2019s exactly the wrong goal.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe sees it very clearly that the race is on,\u201d Huang said, \u201cand if the United States wants to stay ahead, we need to maximize, accelerate our diffusion, not limit it, because somebody else is more than happy to provide it.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s state-led investment in chips has probably exceeded $150 billion over the past decade, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.",
      "Beijing has repeatedly criticized the U.S. over its chip curbs, including guidelines Washington issued last week that said companies anywhere in the world risked violating U.S. export controls if they used advanced Chinese chips such as Huawei\u2019s Ascend without a license.",
      "The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Monday that the U.S. action \u201cseriously undermines\u201d the consensus the U.S. and China reached earlier this month on slashing their tariffs on each other\u2019s goods.",
      "On Wednesday, the ministry further accused the U.S. of \u201cabusing export controls to suppress and contain China.\u201d It pledged to invoke China\u2019s anti-foreign sanctions law against anyone involved in enforcing the U.S. move, slamming it as \u201ca typical example of unilateral bullying and protectionism.\u201d",
      "Mithil Aggarwal reported from Taipei, and Peter Guo reported from Hong Kong."

      "Police in Germany arrested five teenagers accused of involvement with a right-wing extremist group calling itself \u201cLast Defense Wave\u201d that allegedly aimed to destabilize the country\u2019s democratic system by carrying out attacks on migrants and political opponents.",
      "The early-morning arrests in various parts of the country on Wednesday were accompanied by searches at 13 properties, federal prosecutors said in a statement.",
      "Four of those arrested \u2014 identified only as Benjamin H., Ben-Maxim H., Lenny M. and Jason R., in line with German privacy rules \u2014 are suspected of membership in a domestic terror organization. The fifth, Jerome M., is accused of supporting the group. Two of the arrested also are accused of attempted murder and aggravated arson. All are between the ages of 14 and 18.",
      "Prosecutors said they are also investigating three other people, ages 18 to 21, who are already in custody. All the suspects are German citizens.",
      "According to the prosecutors, the group was formed in mid-April 2024 or earlier. They said that its members saw themselves as the last resort to defend the \u201cGerman nation\u201d and aimed to bring about the collapse of Germany\u2019s democratic order, with attacks on homes for asylum-seekers and on facilities associated with the left-wing political spectrum.",
      "Two of the suspects set a fire at a cultural center in Altd\u00f6bern in eastern Germany in October, prosecutors said, adding that several people living in the building at the time escaped injury only by chance.",
      "In January, another two suspects allegedly broke a window at a home for asylum-seekers in Schm\u00f6lln and tried unsuccessfully to start a blaze by setting off fireworks. They daubed the group\u2019s initials and slogans such as \u201cForeigners out,\u201d \u201cGermany for the Germans\u201d and \u201cNazi area,\u201d as well as swastikas, prosecutors said.",
      "Also in January, three suspects allegedly planned an arson attack on a home for asylum-seekers in Senftenberg, but it never came about because of the earlier arrests of two of the men.",
      "Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig said it was \u201cparticularly shocking\u201d that all of those arrested Wednesday were minors at the time the group was allegedly founded.",
      "\u201cThis is an alarm signal and it shows that right-wing extremist terrorism knows no age,\u201d Hubig said in a statement.",
      "In a separate case a week ago, German authorities banned a far-right group called \u201cKingdom of Germany\u201d as a threat to the country\u2019s democratic order and arrested four of its alleged leaders.",
      "In an annual report released Tuesday, the Federal Criminal Police Office said that the number of violent crimes with a right-wing motivation was up 17.2% last year to 1,488. That was part of an overall increase in violent politically motivated offenses to 4,107, an increase of 15.3%."

      "Balochistan\u00a0is Pakistan\u2019s largest province by area, but smallest by population. The province of some 15 million people in the southwest of the country is home to key mining projects but has been roiled by a decades-old insurgency.",

      "It was claimed by the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, an ultra-radical Islamist group.",

      "While Japan\u2019s agriculture ministry has been trying to curb soaring prices by releasing\u00a0government stockpiles, the move has had little effect in reining in prices.",
      "Rice prices in around 1,000 supermarkets\u00a0nationwide reportedly climbed to an all-time high in the week ending May 11. Prices for a 5-kilogram bag of rice rose 54 yen week-on-week to 4,268 yen ($29.63).",

      "The spike in rice prices reflects the lingering effects of poor harvests last year, with domestic rice consumption being overwhelmingly supported by local production rather than imports, said HSBC\u2019s chief Asia economist Frederic Neumann.",
      "Straining the supply side issue is the fact that rice in Japan is produced mostly by elderly people running small farms, so they\u2019re not very efficient, said Sayuri Shirai, a professor of economics under Keio University\u2019s faculty of policy management, who added that the number of farmers is also dropping with the aging population.",

      "Japan\u2019s rice economy remains fairly isolated from the world market, with\u00a0stiff duties on imported rice\u00a0aimed at protecting its rice farmers.",
      "To make matters worse, demand for Japanese rice has\u00a0skyrocketed on the back of high tourist\u00a0footfall, the professor noted.",
      "The sharp increase in rice prices is also partly attributable to panic-driven hoarding by both households and businesses, said Takuji Okubo, chief economist of the Japan Risk Forum.",
      "While some\u00a0retailers announced plans to import rice, unfamiliarity with imported rice among both consumers and businesses makes it unlikely that such imports will meaningfully alleviate the supply-demand imbalance, he told CNBC.",
      "Japan\u2019s inflation\u00a0rose 3.6% year on year in March. Although the figure was lower than the 3.7% seen in February, it still marked three straight years that the headline inflation figure has remained above the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target.",
      "\u201cThat is very high compared to the U.S. or Europe,\u201d said Shirai, who added that Japan\u2019s inflation picture has more to do with cost pressures that are mostly derived from food prices.",
      "\u201cThat is why a lot of consumers are very angry,\u201d Shirai said.",
      "Additionally, the cheap yen also makes food imports expensive, she noted.",
