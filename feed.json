      "Brett Goldstein explores complex relationships in the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201d streaming on Apple TV+ Friday",
      "Brett Goldstein might want to break your heart. Or at least give you a proper ugly cry.",
      "In the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201dstreaming on Apple TV+ Friday, audiences are presented with a sticky conundrum: What if your soulmate, and your best friend, were different people?",
      "Reactions might differ about the choices Simon (Goldstein) and Laura (Imogen Poots) make in the film, which is a kind of rom-com-dram, if you will. But one thing Goldstein has noticed is that a lot of people who see it think that it\u2019s about them.",
      "\u201cI think everyone has this friendship,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in their life that is not their partner that they have a connection that feels more than friends, but what is that? What is love? And does it take away from the other? We just wanted to explore all of that over time.\u201d",
      "The idea came out of a getting to know you conversation with William Bridges, an Emmy winner for \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d whose episodes include \u201cUSS Callister.\" He co-wrote the film with Goldstein, and directed. At the time of the chat, Goldstein was single. Bridges was not. And Goldstein asked him if the woman he was seeing was \u201cthe one.\u201d It got them thinking about the idea of a soulmate test, something that could just take all the guesswork, all the bad dates, all the lost time, out of the equation.",
      "\u201cAll of You\u201d begins with a moment of truth as Simon accompanies Laura, his best friend from university, on her way to take the test. He even pays for it, and soon enough she\u2019s off making plans with a husband to be.",
      "Though the film has a bit of a science fiction element to it, it\u2019s decidedly less dystopian than a \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Some, like Laura, take the test. Some, like Simon, try to do it the old-fashioned way. But many are left wondering if they made the right choice. The film is told linearly, but skips over months and sometimes years in the saga of Laura and Simon.",

      "\u201cI was really conflicted, but I also felt great compassion for each of the characters,\u201d Poots said. \u201cAll a person is the choices they make or don\u2019t make, and I think that feelings and desire and love, these are completely out of your control. And I don\u2019t think you can vilify a person for sort of having them. It\u2019s just when they follow through it obviously complicates things.\u201d",
      "Part of the equation involved making sure that Laura\u2019s soulmate, and husband, wasn\u2019t easy to dismiss. Not only did they write him as kind, loving and a good father. They also cast a handsome Scottish actor, Steven Cree, to play him.",
      "\u201cOne thing we didn\u2019t want to do that I think romantic comedies do a lot is they make the other guy boring or a (expletive)-head. So you\u2019re going, \u2018Oh, obviously not him,\u2019\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cYou have to kind of stack the odds against all of them because that is more real and it\u2019s much more challenging, I think, for an audience because I think you are going \u2018I want this thing to happen and I also don\u2019t want this thing to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d was a kind of unintentional touchstone in thinking about the idea of friendships between straight men and women that only became clear to them after they made the film. An even less intentional reference was \u201cAtonement.\u201d Unbeknownst to the filmmakers, they set a pivotal scene between Laura and Simon in the same cottage on the English Channel in East Sussex that Joe Wright used for his classic tearjerker.",
      "While movie fans might bemoan the lack of the Nora Ephron-style romantic comedies of the 1990s on our screens, modern movies are grappling with the state of relationships in serious, satirical and genre-skewing ways, with films like \u201cMaterialists,\u201d\u201cSplitsville,\u201d \u201cAll of You\u201d and more. The distinction, Bridges said, is perhaps audiences today are craving stories not about aspirational, unattainable romance, but about love \u2014 however complicated and messy it might be.",
      "\u201cWe have seen the movie where somebody runs to the train station at the end and confesses undying love and the movie ends and the idea is they live happily ever after. But I\u2019m not quite sure that that\u2019s the experience of love that a lot of people have,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for love stories rather than romance stories.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- In his dreams, Raymond Chandler could conjure tales as unsettling as some of his greatest novels, as if haunted by the spirits of Kafka and Edgar Allan Poe.",
      "\u201cNightmare,\u201d a brief and rarely seen sketch published this week in The Strand Magazine, finds the author of \u201cThe Long Goodbye,\u201d \u201cFarewell, My Lovely\u201d and other crime fiction classics imagining himself in prison \u201csomewhere\u201d for a murder he does not remember committing. His cellmates include two men he knows nothing about, a pregnant woman named Elsa, and a piano in the corner that must be played lying down after \u201cnine o'clock.\u201d",
      "Chandler's vision becomes even darker and stranger as he learns of his likely fate.",
      "\u201cAs I was wondering, apparently rather audibly, about the date set for my execution, the guard said to me, \u2018After a bit you\u2019ll get a letter with the envelope addressed in your own writing. That will tell you the date for your hanging,'\u201d Chandler wrote.",
      "\u201cNightmare\u201d was found recently among the papers of Chandler's assistant, Jean Vounder-Davis, that were sold last year through the Doyle auction house. Other items included Chandler's 1953 Olivetti Studio 44 typewriter, unpublished drafts of early novels and a two-page list of 46 things he hated, among them \u201cgolf talk\u201d and \u201cnovels about people who can\u2019t make any money.\u201d",
      "Strand Managing Editor Andrew F. Gulli purchased \u201cNightmare\u201d at auction but declined to say how much he paid. Writing in the current edition of The Strand Magazine, Gulli called the piece a perfect illustration of Chandler's \u201cability to evoke so much with so little.\u201d He believes \u201cNightmare\u201d was likely written in the early 1950s, before the death of Chandler's wife, Cissy, whom the author mentions in a footnote. Cissy Pascal Chandler died in 1954, five years before the death of Raymond Chandler.",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Attorneys for the family of a man who died last week after riding a roller coaster at Universal Orlando Resort's newest theme park said Monday that they believe he smacked his head on a restraint during downward thrusts and was unconscious for most of the ride.",
      "The attorneys for the family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, 32, said the fact that he had a spinal disability from birth and used a wheelchair played no role in his death, and he had no medical issues before getting on the Stardust Racers ride at Epic Universe. At a news conference in Orlando, the lawyers also took issue with a top Universal executive last weekend saying in a note to employees that \u201cinternal findings\u201d showed the ride worked as it should have.",
      "\u201cThey are quick to say that, \u2018Well, the ride functioned as it was supposed to. Everything works properly.\u2019 Well, just because it didn\u2019t malfunction does not lead us to believe that there were not safety issues because we know something caused him to die,\u201d said famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump, whose law firm is representing the family.",
      "Zavala's family described him as a theme park enthusiast and a gamer with friends worldwide from gaming. He treasured his independence and drove and cooked for himself. He also worked as an employment counselor for people with disabilities, helping them land jobs and then checking on them once they started working. His parents said they never treated him any differently than his sister and brother because of his disability.",
      "\u201cHe was an extraordinary young man,\u201d said his father, Carlos Rodriguez.",
      "Karen Irwin, Universal Orlando Resort\u2019s president, said in her note that the internal findings showed ride systems functioned normally, equipment was intact and Universal workers followed the proper procedures.

      "Natalie Jackson, another of the family's attorneys, said they believe Zavala suffered repeated head strikes based on what witnesses have said. The family's attorneys said they have opened a line of communication with Universal officials, as the family seeks a full investigation into what happened and desires that the ride remain shuttered until there's an understanding of how Zavala died. They also are hiring a team of experts in ride design, safety, manufacturing and operations to guide their own investigation.",

      "She had just directed an off-Broadway concert version of \u201cRagtime\u201d \u2014 a big, soaring musical celebrating early 20th-century America \u2014 that had wowed critics despite being a bare-boned production with some actors reading from their scripts. Might it fit the bill if she filled it out?",

      "Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu are part of a new wave of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene",
      "HAVANA -- Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu seem shy at first, but the moment they step on stage, they become confident, filling a concert hall in downtown Havana with a hypnotic form of traditional jazz.",
      "The Abreu brothers, aged 19 and 17, are part of a new generation of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene. They are filling a void left by established performers who have emigrated or stayed abroad as the island endures one of its most dire economic crises in decades. Their rise is also fueled by the opening of small, private venues for their shows and the relatively recent spread of internet access on the island, which they use for promotion.",
      "\u201cWe do what we like and we\u2019re fortunate enough to make a living from what we love, which is music,\u201d 19-year-old Fabio Abreu said shortly before a concert at the F\u00e1brica de Arte Cubano, a sprawling cultural center housed in a former factory that now operates as an art gallery, music venue and nightclub.",
      "And it's not just good old traditional jazz like that of the Abreus. Young musicians in Cuba are experimenting with everything, mixing traditional Cuban music like timba and salsa with newer, more daring sounds like electronic music and hip hop.",
      "The Cuban music scene is both complex and interesting, said Michel Hern\u00e1ndez, a writer and journalist specialized in music. \u201cThe recent migration of major Cuban artists \u2014 many with established careers \u2014 has created a void that is now being filled by a new generation of musicians,\u201d he said.",
      "The emerging scene is highly hybrid, he said, blending rock, pop and electronic music with traditional Afro-Cuban music styles such as \u201cson,\u201d which is the root of salsa. The phenomenon has led to the rise of new genres, including the highly commercial \u201creparto,\" a genre that originated in Havana\u2019s working-class neighborhoods and is known for its explicit lyrics.",
      "In addition to new sounds, many of these artists are now performing in small, private bars that have opened over the last decade. And lacking a formal record industry, young Cuban artists rely heavily on social media and the internet \u2014 a tool only widely available on the island since late 2018. They also depend on music videos, some of which are made with very low production budgets, that are shared between phones.",
      "One of them is Melanie Santiler, a 23-year-old pop singer and songwriter who has gained a following among young people. She credits online videos for much of her success. Her Instagram account boasts 248,000 followers, while her YouTube channel has 73,000.",
      "\u201cWe emerging musicians are the ones carrying the flag and shaping the future of Cuban music,\" she said. \u201cFor me, this is a decisive moment.\u201d",

      "\u201cI believe that in moments of heaviness and uncertainty, sometimes taking a moment of lightheartedness and clearing your mind a bit can be good for you,'' Dell'Acqua said backstage. \u201dThis is why I made it so light.\"",

Dell'Acqua also created wilted flowers out of chiffon that he pinned on garments, \u201cas if forgotten by time.\u201d",
      "The lightness allowed Dell'Acqua to layer amply. Plaid kilts were underpinned by petticoat layers. Prairie skirts with a big hem ruffle were tied prettily at the waist. Silken slip dresses were worn one atop the other.",

      "Scarlett Johansson makes her directorial debut with \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d starring June Squibb",
      "There is a lovely story of friendship, grief and starting over at the heart of \u201cEleanor the Great.\u201d The film, directed by Scarlett Johansson in her feature debut, gets tangled in a plot contrivance that is, at best, unnecessary and at worst, loathsome.",
      "That\u2019s the problem with the elevator pitch mentality, though. A story about a 90-something trying to make friends in a new city might sound a little too simple, a little too straightforward. What if she does so by pretending to be a Holocaust survivor? I\u2019m not kidding.",
      "Eleanor is played by June Squibb (the great). At 94-years-old, she has moved from Florida to New York after the death of her best friend and roommate Bessie (Rita Zohar). Her daughter, Lisa (Jessica Hecht), and grandson, Max (Will Price), have taken her into their small Manhattan apartment, but they only seem interested in getting Eleanor into an assisted living arrangement. Lisa especially treats her mother's presence like an inconvenience, a problem to fix, and Eleanor starts looking elsewhere for companionship.",
      "The thing is Eleanor had a great life in Florida, living with her platonic best friend in a little apartment. The script, Tory Kamen\u2019s first produced screenplay, smartly introduces this idyllic moment first. It is a distinct joy to watch the two nonagenarians go about their daily activities, from velcroing their shoes to doing their exercises on the beach.",
      "Squibb recently had a version of this in the delightful \u201cThelma,\u201d but there she was alone, a widow determined to hold onto her independent living situation. Here, Bessie and Eleanor help each other, whether it\u2019s waking up on time, or standing up for the other at the local supermarket when their preferred brand of kosher pickles isn\u2019t on the shelf and the teenage employee dares to suggest that \u201call pickles taste the same.\u201d Then Bessie suddenly dies, and Eleanor is left with no choice but to start over.",
      "It\u2019s hard to make new friends anywhere, at any age, but perhaps even more so in drizzly, cold New York. When a friendly woman at the Jewish Community Center asks Eleanor if she\u2019s here for \u201cthe group,\u201d Eleanor doesn\u2019t question it. Yes, she says with a relieved smile. When it becomes clear that this group is for Holocaust survivors, she does try to leave, but everyone encourages her to stay and suddenly she\u2019s telling Bessie\u2019s story of losing her brother in Poland as her own. The script has already established Eleanor as a bit of a liar \u2014 but they\u2019re the small kinds, the white lies that, she says, aren\u2019t hurting anyone.",

      "Nina has recently lost her mother and finds solace in this relationship. It\u2019s here where you can start to see how the rest of the movie is going to play out, how the lie will go on too long and be exposed at a terrible time, leading to inevitable feelings of betrayal and humiliation. And it is very, very hard to watch Squibb in distress. Rather than celebrate the performance you want to lash out at the script that put her in this situation in the first place. That may not be fair but it\u2019s also true.",
      "The story becomes less of a character study of the strange ways in which grief manifests and more about the escalating hijinks of a lie that takes on a wild life of its own. Soon Eleanor is speaking to Nina\u2019s journalism peers in an on-the-record, taped conversation, telling another of Bessie\u2019s stories. Then, Nina\u2019s distant father ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ), a local news anchor, decides Eleanor\u2019s is a great human-interest story for his show.",
      "There is a thread about the merits of preserving memory, but it\u2019s introduced a little too late and too flimsily to justify all that came before it. Johansson directs the proceedings simply, like a classic New York character drama, allowing the performances to shine over the filmmaking, but who she is as a filmmaker remains to be seen. Squibb and Kellyman, both terrific, are the real reasons to seek out \u201cEleanor the Great.\u201d The film may trip over its own contrivances but their performances will leave you moved.",
      "\u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csome language, thematic elements and suggestive references.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "Miles Mykkanen has come a long way since his musical theater dreams shifted to opera at Juilliard",
      "NEW YORK -- Miles Mykkanen grew up wanting to sing and dance on Broadway, but he was turned down by the musical theater programs he applied to for college. So he had to \u201csettle\u201d for studying opera at the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center.",
      "\u201cAt 18, when your sights are set on 42nd Street and then you\u2019re getting called to 65th Street, it was weirdly a letdown,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut after a few hours I kind of slapped myself and said \u2018Miles, pull yourself together.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was 16 years ago, and he has since pulled himself together to such an extent that at age 34 he\u2019s just opened the Metropolitan Opera season in a leading role in a new opera, \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.\u201d",
      "With a libretto by Gene Scheer and score by Mason Bates, the opera is based on the novel by Michael Chabon. Mykkanen portrays Sammy Clay, a Jewish kid growing up in World War II-era Brooklyn who teams with his cousin, Czech refugee Joe Kavalier, to create a comic strip hero modeled on Superman.",
      "He\u2019ll also be back at the Met in the spring in another modern opera, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho\u2019s \u201cInnocence.\u201d He plays the Bridegroom, a part he first sang in 2024 when San Francisco Opera gave the work\u2019s U.S. premiere.",
      "Mykkanen had sung at the Met before, mostly attracting little attention in small parts, though his haunting rendition of the Holy Fool in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d in 2021 drew critical acclaim.",
      "\u201cBut this season is so ideal,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cAll of a sudden my schedule came together, and I thought, my God, where did this all come from.\u201d",
      "When the Met was casting \u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d it was Michael Heaston, the artistic administrator, who thought of Mykkanen for the role of Sammy.",
      "\u201cI first became acquainted with Miles when he was still a student at Juilliard, and he immediately impressed me,\u201d Heaston said. \u201cHe is a singer who can straddle genres, that rare artist who can sing a heartfelt operatic aria in one moment and then turn on a dime to a classic tune from the American Songbook.",
      "\u201cWhen I looked at Mason\u2019s score and considered the vocal and acting demands alike, it seemed tailor-made for Miles.\u201d",
      "Mary Birnbaum, who taught Mykkanen acting at Juilliard, said she\u2019s not surprised at his sudden rise to prominence.",
      "\u201cHonestly it\u2019s what I thought he would do all along,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very American sound, and it\u2019s appealing and it\u2019s lush. But also he\u2019s bold as an actor \u2026 and he makes material look better for being in it.\u201d",
      "By coincidence, both his roles this season are people who have something to hide. \u201cThey are characters with two huge secrets that are kind of gnawing away at them,\u201d Mykkanen said.",

      "\u201cInnocence\u201d deals with the lingering effects of a school shooting 10 years later, and as secrets are peeled away, the Bridegroom\u2019s role in the horrific events is gradually exposed.",
      "Mykkanen relishes the very different musical challenges the two roles provide. Saariaho\u2019s score for \u201cInnocence,\u201d he said is composed with a kind of \u201cmathematical\u201d precision. \u201cWhen I first cracked it open, it was overwhelming because of the time signatures, the key signatures. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what was she thinking, how do you put this all together?\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d written in a style that uses what Bates calls \u201csymphonic electronica,\u201d has been easier to learn. \u201cI almost feel it\u2019s starting to carve a new genre in opera,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSomething American opera has been trying to find in the last decade or so. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay to say it\u2019s musical theater, but at times it\u2019s very colloquial.\u201d",
      "Mykkanen grew up in the remote Ironwood region of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, where both his parents were high school band directors. Though he displayed a talent for singing at a young age, it was show music rather than opera that inspired him.

      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers for music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs urged a New York federal judge Monday to sentence him early next month to no more than 14 months in prison for his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, meaning he'd go free almost immediately if the judge agreed.",
      "The lawyers made their arguments in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who has already rejected a proposed $50 million bail package, signaling that he doesn't believe the Grammy-winning artist is close to being released.",
      "\u201cMr. Combs\u2019s celebrity status in the realms of music, fashion, spirits, media, and finance has been shattered and Mr. Combs\u2019s legacy has been destroyed,\u201d the lawyers wrote, saying their client has been punished enough.",
      "The submission provided new information about what life behind bars for nearly 13 months has been like for Combs, what's happened to his businesses and other interests and explains why he turned down a plea-deal offer from prosecutors prior to his trial.",
      "Combs faces an Oct. 3 sentencing after his July conviction by a Manhattan jury on two Mann Act charges that outlaw interstate commerce related to prostitution. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The Bad Boy Records founder was exonerated on more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that would have required a minimum of 15 years in prison and the possibility of a life sentence.",
      "In their submission, Combs' lawyers argued that a jury sent a loud message to the judge by exonerating him of the most serious charges.",
      "\u201cPut simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an \u2018affirmative indication of innocence,\u2019\u201d the lawyers said.",
      "\u201cHe has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America \u2014 yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life,\u201d they added.",
      "Prosecutors, who will submit their recommendations prior to the Oct. 3 sentencing, have already said they\u2019ll urge Combs stay imprisoned substantially longer than the four to five years they originally thought.",
      "Defense lawyers, though, wrote in their submission Monday that prosecutors \u201chave lost all perspective.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Combs\u2019s career and reputation have been destroyed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHis life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled.\u201d",
      "Among other things, they noted that he had to let go over 100 employees from his businesses and many of them have been unable to get new jobs because of their past association with Combs.",
      "His seven children, they said, have faced \u201cdevastating consequences,\u201d including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.",
      "The lawyers also noted that Combs and his family were set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public.",
      "Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.",

      "Pamela Anderson has embraced a makeup-free lifestyle at 58, attending fashion shows and film premieres with a bare face",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Pamela Anderson has nothing against makeup. It's just that she's been there, done that in her younger years. That's why now, at 58, she's attending fashion shows and film premieres with a blissfully bare face.",
      "It's a look, especially for older women, that serves to plague and perplex. Do we chase youth (and relevancy) with a full face, or do we foster radiant skin and march on makeup free?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the prettiest girl in the room,\u201d Anderson told Vogue ahead of a recent show she attended during Paris Fashion Week. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just freedom. It\u2019s like a relief.\u201d",
      "Down here in the non-celebrity world, is it just as easy and comfortable to go makeup free? Some proponents of the look, along with style and beauty experts, weigh in.",
      "Women, particularly older women, are not universally giving up makeup, but Anderson, Alicia Keys and other celebrities who have publicly shown off bare faces have certainly inspired some to cast it off.",
      "Working women, however, acknowledge difficulties doing that on the job \u2014 especially in traditional, less creative work spaces.",
      "\u201cI do still think that there are some politics associated with it. More around feeling and looking polished,\u201d said Deborah Borg, the chief of human resources for a creative-leaning company that has roughly 25,000 employees.",
      "She said she's seen more women come into work makeup-free since COVID, and thinks the pandemic significantly altered the workplace dynamic.",
      "Borg, 49, gave up makeup four years ago, save an occasional swipe of her bold, signature red lipstick. At Dalya, a cozy clothing shop in New York's trendy Soho neighborhood, she lent herself as a model to demonstrate how to help one's bare skin glow and how to use attire and accessories to accentuate the look.",
      "Makeup artist Rebecca Robles counseled Borg and others with mature skin to think hydration when choosing products to make the most of their bare faces.",
      "Robles recommends a five-step workday routine: A gentle cleanser that doesn't strip the skin; a vitamin C serum to brighten and mitigate fine lines; a moisturizer with sun protection; a separate broad-spectrum sunscreen for an extra boost (don't forget to apply that to the ears); and a glossy lip balm for a bit of added polish.",
      "No mascara? No problem. Use a lash curler to offer a bit of pop to the eye, Robles said. And gently brush brows into place to complete the look.",
      "Find products with hyaluronic acid and ceramides, Robles suggests, and always swipe up with skincare products. Minimize tugging and pulling on the skin.",
      "\u201cWhen your skin is glowing, one thing that\u2019s really fun to keep in mind is that light reflects off that moisture in the skin and can help blur out any fine lines or enlarged pores. So it\u2019s win-win,\u201d Robles said.",
      "She advised that each product should sit for a minute or two before the next step is applied.",
      "Borg emphasized the ease of her morning routine since going makeup free. She used to spend about 30 minutes just on makeup. Now, she does hair and face in half that time.",

      "Finally, accessorize. Tincher said added touches like lapel pins, earrings and necklaces can provide a finished polish \u2014 especially if that polish is still expected at work. A considered style can offset judgments about going makeup free, she said.",

      "Although Harris earned a reputation as guarded and circumspect, the book has the tone of someone who is finished biting her tongue. She concedes mistakes, reveals frustrations and details some of the stranger moments from her race.",
      "The book isn't a winding memoir or a political treatise, and Harris doesn't disclose any future plans. Instead, it reads like a ticking time bomb, with each chapter counting down to Election Day.",
      "Here's some memorable moments.",

      "Biden's team appeared to be in denial. Afterward, they gave Harris talking points that said \u201cJOE BIDEN WON.\"",
      "Harris wrote warmly of her partnership with Biden, but there were frosty moments too. As Biden faced calls to drop out of the race, he invited Harris to join him for a Fourth of July celebration at the White House.",
      "First lady Jill Biden pulled Harris' husband Doug Emhoff aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you supporting us?\u201d",

      "Christopher Nolan has been elected to lead the Directors Guild of America, the organization said late Saturday. The Oscar-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d filmmaker said in a statement that it is, \u201cone of the greatest honors of my career.\u201d",
      "The guild represents the interests of some 19,500 film and television directors in the United States and abroad, in addition to hosting the DGA awards annually.",
      "\u201cOur industry is experiencing tremendous change, and I thank the Guild\u2019s membership for entrusting me with this responsibility,\u201d said Nolan, a well-known champion of the theatrical experience and film stock.",
      "The box office success of \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which was shot entirely on large-format film ( a combination of 70mm and IMAX ), and made over $976 million worldwide made many in the industry reconsider the mass audience appeal of a format that not too long ago was in danger of extinction. Just over a decade ago, facing bankruptcy and an industry that seemed to be migrating to digital, Kodak nearly stopped film production. Filmmakers like Nolan, Martin Scorsese and others rallied to keep it going. Earlier this year, Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d helped prove the point again.",
      "Nolan will take over for outgoing president Lesli Linka Glatter, who led the group for four years through the Hollywood strikes of 2023. He said he looks forward to collaborating with Glatter and the board \u201cto achieve important creative and economic protections for our members.\u201d",
      "The DGA\u2019s current three-year basic agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios and streamers about rates and benefits, expires next year. The AMPTP congratulated Nolan in a statement and wrote that they \u201clook forward to partnering with President Nolan to address the issues most important to DGA members while ensuring our member companies remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon has stepped back from the policy that requires all troops to get the flu shot every year by introducing exemptions for reservists and proclaiming that the shot is only necessary in some circumstances for all service members, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The memo, written by Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg on May 29 and sent to all the military services, says reserve troops now will need to be on active duty for 30 days or more before being required to get an annual flu shot. It also says the military will no longer be paying for reservists or National Guard members to get the vaccine on their own time.",
      "News of the policy change, which has not been publicly announced by the Pentagon, comes as the Trump administration and its advisers have suggested changes to other vaccination guidance. An influential immunization panel that the administration updated to include anti-vaccine figures decided to not recommend the COVID-19 shot to anyone, while President Donald Trump used his platform to promote unproven and, in some cases, discredited ties between the pain reliever Tylenol, vaccines and autism.",
      "At the Pentagon, the flu shot memo declared that \u201cgoing forward, the Department will conserve its resources by requiring seasonal flu vaccination for Service members only when doing so most directly contributes to readiness.\" However, the document is not clear about the changes because it later says the annual requirement for active-duty troops is still in effect.",
      "While the memo was quietly sent months ago, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth drew attention to it Wednesday when he reposted a comment from an anonymous account that claimed they \u201cwon\u2019t be forced to get a flu shot this fall for the privilege of serving my state and country in the National Guard.\u201d",

Those who declined the vaccination have been able to return to service since 2023, but only 113 of the more than 8,000 discharged service members had chosen to do so.",
      "The back pay offer was intended to encourage more to reenlist but met with limited success. Two months later, Pentagon officials said only 13 people \u2014 all Army soldiers \u2014 had rejoined the military.",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- At age 13, Katrine Petersen was fitted with a contraceptive device by Danish doctors without her consent.",
      "She had become pregnant, and after doctors in the Greenlandic town of Maniitsoq terminated her pregnancy, they fitted her with an intrauterine contraceptive device, commonly known as an IUD, or coil.",
      "Now 52 and living in Denmark, Petersen recalled being told she had been fitted with the device before leaving the hospital.",
      "\u201cBecause of my age, I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said tearfully. \u201cI kept it inside me and never talked about it.\u201d",

      "Later in life, after she married, she was unable to have children.",
      "At a ceremony in Greenland 's capital of Nuuk on Wednesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen will offer their official apologies for their governments' roles in the mistreatment of Greenlandic Indigenous girls and women who were given invasive contraception by the Danish health authorities against their will, with cases dating back to the 1960s.",
      "\u201cWe cannot change what has happened, but we can take responsibility and we can create the conditions for reconciliation with the past,\u201d Frederiksen said in a statement released Monday, adding the Danish government intends to establish a reconciliation fund to financially compensate victims.",
      "Last month, Denmark and Greenland already published apologies for their roles in the mistreatment of the women and girls just ahead of the publication of an independent investigation into the abuse.",
      "The event comes at a difficult time with U.S. President Donald Trump exploiting divisions between Denmark and Greenland as it seeks U.S. influence, even jurisdiction over the territory.",
      "Meanwhile, Denmark has sought to placate the independence movement in Greenland but historical abuses committed by the former colonial power have tainted their efforts at a rapprochement.",
      "Greenland, which remains part of the Danish realm, was a colony under Denmark\u2019s crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later Greenland became a self-governing entity.",

      "An independent investigation, published earlier this month, found Inuit victims, some 12 years old and younger, were either fitted with IUDs or given hormonal birth control injections. They were not told details about the procedure, nor did they give their consent.",
      "Some described traumatic experiences that left them with feelings of shame as well as physical side effects, from pain and bleeding to serious infections.",
      "While the report covered the experiences of 354 women who spoke with investigators, Danish authorities say more than 4,000 women and girls \u2014 reportedly half the fertile women in Greenland at the time \u2014 received IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s. It\u2019s not known how many of those cases lacked consent.",

      "The alleged purpose of the forced contraception was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies. The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care. Greenland took over its own health care programs in 1992.",
      "Kirstine Berthelsen, 66, who now lives in Copenhagen, will attend Wednesday's event in Nuuk. She believes she was 14 when she was fitted with an IUD in Greenland.

      "But the drop in adult syphilis cases is generally attributed to the growing use of the antibiotic doxycycline as a morning-after pill, specifically for gay and bisexual men and transgender women who recently had an STD diagnosis. Cases of primary and secondary syphilis, the disease's most infectious stages, fell 22% last year, the CDC says.",

      "Officials say the \u201chydrocarbon roadmap\u201d is a strategy to modernize Ecuador\u2019s oil industry, attract foreign capital and boost production. Their plan includes contract renegotiations and new licensing rounds that the government says comply with existing legal frameworks.",

      "Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in an article published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said.",
      "Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.",
      "\u201cThe rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,\u201d said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.",
      "It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.",
      "That may play out in doctors\u2019 offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat \u2014 like urinary tract infections \u2014 could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report\u2019s authors.",

The bill also could help get the death penalty carried out again in the ninth-largest U.S. state.",
      "Senate and House Republicans unveiled legislation that their leaders previously signaled would surface when the General Assembly reconvened on Monday after nearly two months away from Raleigh.",

An array of Republicans, President Donald Trump among them, have attempted to blame Zarutska's death on Charlotte-area leaders and Democratic state officials for what they call soft-on-crime policies.",
      "The Senate approved the legislation 28-8 late Monday, with many Democrats absent from the otherwise party-line vote. The bill now goes to the House, where a vote is likely Tuesday.",
      "Any final measure would then go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein\u2019s desk. Stein, the former attorney general, has suggested pretrial release changes and greater emphasis on mental health are needed in light of Zarutska's death.",
      "But the measure took a different direction \u2014 away from bipartisan support \u2014 when Senate Republicans approved an amendment that could in the future open the door to other forms of capital punishment beyond lethal injection, which is currently the state\u2019s sole method. North Carolina last carried out an execution in 2006.",
      "The stabbing suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., could received a death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in state court or a federal count filed against him.",
      "Brown, whose criminal record included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon, had been charged in January in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, with misusing the 911 system, a misdemeanor, according to court records.",
      "But a magistrate \u2014 a nonelected local court official who often determines if a defendant can be released while awaiting trial \u2014 released him on a written promise to return for court. And it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation for him. Brown\u2019s mother told Charlotte-area television that she had sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home.",
      "GOP Sen. Ralph Hise said the legislation has nothing to do with winning political points, but rather is a response to the failure of the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cWe need a criminal justice system that protects society from individuals. I believe these are many great steps in this bill,\u201d Hise said.",
      "The measure, named \u201cIryna\u2019s Law,\u201d would prohibit cashless bail for certain crimes and eliminate some of the discretion that magistrates and judges have for pretrial release decisions.",
      "For example, first-time defendants accused of a violent offense could only be released on a secured cash bond or receive house arrest with electronic monitoring. Such house arrest and monitoring would be the only option for some repeat defendants.",
      "The bill also attempts to ensure that more suspects are subject to psychological examinations before their potential release. Defendants accused of a violent crime and committed involuntarily in recent years to a mental health facility would be subject to a psychological evaluation.",

      "A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta for two days this week to consider various vaccine recommendations",
      "NEW YORK -- A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta this week to consider whether to revise recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B, and a combination shot that protects children against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.",
      "The panel, which is charged with making vaccine recommendations, declined to recommend COVID-19 vaccines, saying instead that people could make individual decisions \u2014 a move that adds confusion as people weigh whether to get a dose this fall.",
      "During the sometimes chaotic two-day meeting, the panel also recommended new restrictions for a vaccine that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. In a surprise move, the group indefinitely postponed an expected vote on hepatitis B shots given to infants on the day they are born.",
      "With Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, leading the country's health agencies, the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, struck a different tone from past gatherings. Among the 12 members, all chosen this year by Kennedy after he fired the previous 17-member panel, are people who have criticized and spread misinformation about vaccines. Critics say the panel's makeup and agenda could sow distrust in the shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations will be sent to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that has been rocked by disagreements over Kennedy's vaccine policies. The panel's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC, and then widely followed by doctors and insurers.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the meeting.",
      "The panel on Friday debated COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus has remained a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths last fall and winter, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year\u2019s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.",
      "Panelists declined to recommend the shots for anyone, including seniors and high-risk populations. They said individuals could make their own decisions. Removing the recommendations that were previously in place may confuse Americans trying to decide whether and how to get their fall boosters.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "The divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.",
      "Several states have announced policies to try to ensure people's access to COVID-19 vaccines, worried about Friday\u2019s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continue covering the shots through 2026.",
      "The committee recommended that a combined vaccine known as MMRV should not be given to children under 4. Instead, they said in an 8-3 vote with one abstention, children in this age group should get separate vaccines \u2014 one for MMR and another for varicella, or chickenpox.",
      "Their discussions centered on rare feverish seizures that can occur in kids who receive the first dose, between the ages of 1 and 2. Medical experts agree these seizures, while potentially frightening for families, are not linked to brain function or school problems.",
      "In 2009, the ACIP changed a previous recommendation to advise that either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.",
      "Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations.",
      "About 85% of children already receive separate doses for the first round, according to information presented at the meeting.",

      "But experts have raised concerns that other kids could have a hard time getting the combination vaccine as a result of the panel's recommendation. Government insurance programs like Medicaid, for example, would have to stop paying for the early combo dose if the acting CDC director accepts the panel's guidance.",
      "Ever since the ACIP panel in 2005 recommended a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, cases of the liver virus among infants have dropped by more than half.",
      "Nonetheless, the committee opted to revisit the guidance in this week's meeting, with members questioning whether babies born to moms who test negative for hepatitis B really need a vaccine at birth.",
      "The panelists considered whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination \u2014 something doctors and parents already can choose to do.",
      "One committee member asked if the vaccination right after birth was \u201casking our babies to solve an adult problem.\u201d Hepatitis B can spread through sex, sharing needles, or from an infected mother to a newborn baby.",
      "But several outside medical experts criticized that the committee was debating the issue at all and said the vaccine is safe and successful at reducing infant infections.",
      "After discussing it on Thursday, the panel decided Friday morning to indefinitely postpone a vote on the issue.",
      "Chairman Martin Kulldorff opened the meeting by challenging former CDC directors to a public debate. Several doctors representing outside medical groups accused the panel of not following the CDC\u2019s long-established guidelines in weighing evidence for making recommendations.",
      "CDC staff, as usual, presented numerous studies on the topics being debated, explaining how they chose which research to discuss. But a few times, panel members cited different papers they had found, including ones done in mice, which are not generally considered applicable.",
      "The committee also took a vote on Thursday that they had to redo on Friday morning concerning the government\u2019s Vaccines for Children program, which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids. On Friday, they voted to align coverage under the program with their guidance on MMRV shots. A day earlier, they had voted no on the idea.",
      "\u201cWe are rookies. \u2026 There are many technical issues that we might not grasp as of yet,\u201d Kulldorff said. He said a committee member had told him that \u201cmaybe we didn\u2019t quite understand what was going on\u201d with the vote.",
      "At one point Thursday, one of the panelists appeared to be napping, with his eyes closed and his chin resting on his chest.",
      "Doctors and public health experts watching the meeting unfold said they are concerned that the committee is creating fear and mistrust around vaccines at a time when U.S. vaccination rates are already falling.",
      "They suggested the new panel was selectively using its recommendations to justify specific conclusions, rather than considering all the evidence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s troubling to see the erosion of the committee\u2019s integrity,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer of the American Medical Association.",

      "She had become pregnant, and after doctors in the Greenlandic town of Maniitsoq terminated her pregnancy, they fitted her with an intrauterine contraceptive device, commonly known as an IUD, or coil.",
      "Now 52 and living in Denmark, Petersen recalled being told she had been fitted with the device before leaving the hospital.",
      "\u201cBecause of my age, I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said tearfully. \u201cI kept it inside me and never talked about it.\u201d",
      "Petersen said her trauma led to \u201canger, depression, and too much to drink,\" as she suppressed memories of her experiences and didn\u2019t speak about it with doctors.",
      "Later in life, after she married, she was unable to have children.",
      "At a ceremony in Greenland 's capital of Nuuk on Wednesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, her voice cracking, apologized to Greenlandic Indigenous girls and women like Petersen who were given invasive contraception by the Danish health authorities against their will in cases dating back to the 1960s.",
      "\u201cToday, there is only one real thing to say: Sorry,\u201d Frederiksen said in Danish, after Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen delivered a somber address in Greenlandic. \u201cSorry for the wrong that was done to you because you were Greenlanders. Sorry for what was taken from you, and for the pain it caused.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of you have been fighting for years for justice and for us to listen, for us to take responsibility, and we\u2019re doing that now: Denmark and Greenland together,\" Frederiksen said, lamenting \"a chapter in our shared history that should never have been written.\u201d",
      "\u201cOn behalf of Denmark. Sorry,\u201d she said to polite applause.",

      "Meanwhile, Denmark has sought to placate the independence movement in Greenland, but historical abuses committed by the former colonial power have tainted its efforts at a rapprochement.",
      "Greenland, which remains part of the Danish realm, was a colony under Denmark\u2019s crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later, Greenland became a self-governing entity.",

      "The policies included the removal of young Inuit children from their parents to be given to Danish foster families for reeducation and controversial parental competency tests that resulted in the forced separation of Greenlandic families.",
      "An independent investigation, published earlier this month, found Inuit victims, some 12 years old and younger, were either fitted with IUDs or given hormonal birth control injections. They were not told details about the procedure, nor did they give their consent.",
      "Some described traumatic experiences that left them with feelings of shame as well as physical side effects, from pain and bleeding to serious infections.",
      "While the report covered the experiences of 354 women who spoke with investigators, Danish authorities say more than 4,000 women and girls \u2014 reportedly half the fertile women in Greenland at the time \u2014 received IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s. It\u2019s not known how many of those cases lacked consent.",
      "\u201cOf course, I\u2019m thinking about all the women who were treated like I was,\u201d said Petersen, who had her IUD removed earlier this year, after not speaking about her experiences for over 30 years. \u201cI feel with my fellow women from this episode of our life.\u201d",
      "The alleged purpose of the forced contraception was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies. The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care. Greenland took over its own health care programs in 1992.",

State broadcaster CCTV said the typhoon made landfall along the coast of Hailing Island in Yangjiang city at about 5 p.m., packing maximum winds near the center of 144 kph (89 mph). Violent winds battered trees and buildings, with torrential rain lowering visibility, video from Xinhua showed.",

      "Iran has begun rebuilding missile-production sites targeted by Israel during its 12-day war in June",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran has begun rebuilding missile-production sites targeted by Israel during its 12-day war in June, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show, but a key component is likely still missing \u2014 the large mixers needed to produce solid fuel for the weapons.",
      "Reconstituting the missile program is crucial for the Islamic Republic, which believes another round of war with Israel may happen. The missiles are one of Iran\u2019s few military deterrents after the war decimated its air defense systems \u2014 something that Tehran long has insisted will never be included in negotiations with the West.",
      "Missile experts told AP that obtaining the mixers is a goal for Tehran, particularly as it prepares for possible United Nations sanctions to be reimposed on the country later this month. The sanctions would penalize any development of the missile program, among other measures. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is due to address the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.",
      "Known as planetary mixers, the machines feature blades that revolve around a central point, like orbiting planets, and offer better mixing action than other types of equipment. Iran could purchase them from China, where experts and U.S. officials say they've purchased missile fuel ingredients and other components in the past.",
      "\"If they\u2019re able to reacquire some key things like planetary mixers, then that infrastructure is still there and ready to get rolling again,\u201d said Sam Lair, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who studied Iranian missile sites.",
      "Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to questions about the country's efforts to rebuild its missile program.",
      "Solid-fuel missiles can be fired faster than those using liquid fuel, which must be loaded just before launch. That speed can make the difference between launching a missile and having it destroyed in a launcher \u2014 something that happened during the war with Israel.",
      "Iran has solid-fuel missile manufacturing bases at Khojir and Parchin, two sites just outside Tehran, as well as at Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) northeast of the capital. Even before the most recent war, all of those sites came under Israeli attack in October 2024 during hostilities between the countries.",
      "Attacks during the war in June appeared aimed at destroying buildings that housed the mixers, which are needed to ensure the missile fuel is evenly combined, according to experts. Other sites struck by Israel included manufacturing facilities that likely could be used to make the mixers.",
      "Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken this month and analyzed by AP show construction at both the Parchin and Shahroud facilities.",
      "At Parchin, mixing buildings appear to be under repair, Lair said, and similar rebuilding is happening at Shahroud involving mixing buildings and other structures.",
      "The speed at which Iran is rebuilding shows the importance Tehran puts on its missile program. Iran's bombed nuclear sites so far have not seen the same level of activity.",
      "During the war, Iran fired 574 ballistic missiles at Israel, according to the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security of America, which has a close relationship with the Israeli military. In two exchanges of fire before the war, Iran launched another 330 missiles, the think tank said.",
      "The Israeli military had estimated Iran's total arsenal at around 2,500 missiles, meaning that over a third of its missiles were fired.",
      "Before the war, Iran was on track to be able to produce more than 200 solid-fuel missiles a month, said Carl Parkin, a summer fellow at the James Martin Center. That drew Israeli strikes to missile-building facilities.",
      "\u201cIsrael\u2019s targeting indicates that they believed mixing was a bottleneck in Iran\u2019s missile production,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Iran is able to overcome their mixing limitations, they\u2019ll have all the casting capacity that they need to start producing at high volumes again.\u201d",

      "Such chemicals may have caused a massive explosion in April that killed at least 70 people at a port in Iran. Iran still has not explained the blast, which happened as its diplomats met with Americans in Oman over its nuclear program.",
      "Just days after the explosion, the U.S. State Department sanctioned Chinese firms it said provided the Islamic Republic with \u201cballistic missile propellant ingredients.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Iran's Revolutionary Guard likely supplied a planetary mixer to an underground ballistic missile construction facility in Syria near the town of Masyaf, some 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, near the Lebanese border. Footage released by the Israeli military months after the September 2024 raid on the facility showed the mixer, which bore a resemblance to others sold online by Chinese firms.",
      "Iran's president and military officials visited Beijing earlier this month for China's Victory Day parade.

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A top South Korean official said Thursday that North Korea is operating a total of four uranium enrichment facilities, adding to outside assessments that it has multiple covert atomic plants along with the widely known site near the capital of Pyongyang.",
      "The North's leader Kim Jong Un has called for a rapid expansion of his country's nuclear weapons program and recently said he would never make the arms a negotiating point in response to overtures by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "The South\u2019s Unification Minister Chung Dong-young said uranium enrichment centrifuges at the four facilities \u2014 which would include the known site at Yongbyon, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Pyongyang \u2014 are running everyday and stressed the urgency to stop the North\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Chung did not elaborate further on the location of the other, undeclared nuclear sites. He spoke about the North with local reporters, according to his ministry.",
      "Chung cited an assessment that the North possesses 2,000 kilograms (about 4,400 pounds) of highly enriched uranium. He first said that was based on intelligence but the ministry later clarified it was attributed to civilian experts.",
      "If confirmed, the amount would also signal a sharp increase in North Korea's stockpile of nuclear material.",
      "In 2018, Stanford University scholars, including nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker who had previously visited the Yongbyon complex, said the North had about 250 to 500 kilograms (550 to 1,100 pounds) of highly enriched uranium, sufficient for 25 to 30 nuclear devices.",
      "Nuclear weapons can be built using either highly enriched uranium or plutonium, and North Korea has facilities to produce both at Yongbyon. Last year, North Korea released photographs of what it said was a uranium enrichment facility, the first such disclosure since it showed the one at Yongbyon to Hecker and others in 2010.",
      "The location and other details of the facility in the photographs remain unknown.",
      "Foreign experts believe North Korea has built additional uranium-enrichment sites as Kim has been pushing hard to expand his nuclear arsenal.",
      "A plutonium plant is typically large and generates much heat, making it easier for outsiders to detect than a uranium enrichment plant, which is more compact and can be easily hidden from satellite cameras. Centrifuges to enrich uranium can be clandestinely operated underground.",

      "In 2018, a top South Korean official told parliament that North Korea was estimated to have already manufactured 20-60 nuclear weapons, but some experts say the North likely has more than 100. Estimates of how many nuclear bombs North Korea can add to its arsenal every year vary, ranging from six to as many as 18.",
      "International diplomacy on ending North Korea's nuclear program has stalled since 2019, when high-stakes summitry between Kim and Trump fell apart without any agreement.",
      "At the time, Kim offered to dismantle the Yongbyon complex if he won extensive sanctions relief. But the American side rejected his proposal, because it would be a limited denuclearization step that would leave North Korea\u2019s other, already built nuclear weapons and nuclear facilities intact.",
      "Kim has since shunned any diplomacy with the U.S. and South Korea and focused on running weapons tests and perfecting nuclear missiles that target his rivals.",
      "Since returning to office, Trump has repeatedly expressed hopes of restarting talks with Kim. Earlier this week, Kim said he still has good memories of Trump but urged the U.S. to drop its demand that the North surrender its nuclear arms as a precondition for resuming long-stalled diplomacy.",
      "Analysts assess that Kim would likely perceive an enlarged nuclear arsenal as a source of greater leverage in potential talks with the U.S.",
      "They say that in any potential negotiations, Kim would again seek to win sweeping sanctions relief and improved ties with the U.S. in return for a partial surrender of his nuclear and missile programs.",

      "A Paris court has sentenced former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to five years in prison",
      "PARIS -- A Paris court sentenced former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to 5 years in prison and -- in a major surprise -- said he\u2019ll be incarcerated even if he appeals, after finding him guilty Thursday in his trial for alleged illegal campaign financing by Libya.",
      "The court said the date of his incarceration will be decided later, sparing the 70-year-old the humiliation of being marched out of the courtroom by police officers and going straight to jail.",
      "The court found Sarkozy guilty of criminal association in a plot from 2005 to 2007 to finance his campaign with funds from Libya in exchange for diplomatic favors. But it cleared him of three other charges -- including passive corruption, illegal campaign financing and concealment of the embezzlement of public funds.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "A Paris court found former French President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty on a key charge but acquitted him on three others Thursday in his trial for the alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign with money from the government of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "The court is still detailing its ruling and hasn\u2019t immediately sentenced the 70-year-old Sarkozy. That step would come later in the court proceedings Thursday. Sarkozy can appeal the guilty verdict, which would suspend any sentence pending the appeal.",
      "The court found Sarkozy guilty of criminal association in a plot from 2005 to 2007 to finance his campaign with funds from Libya in exchange for diplomatic favors. But it cleared him of three other charges -- including passive corruption, illegal campaign financing and concealment of the embezzlement of public funds.",
      "Still, criminal association is a serious charge, carrying a potential sentence of up to 10 years in prison.",
      "The court also found two of Sarkozy\u2019s closest associates when he was president -- former ministers Claude Gu\u00e9ant and Brice Hortefeux \u2014 guilty of criminal association but likewise acquitted them of some other charges.",
      "Overall, the ruling suggested that the court believed that the men conspired to seek Libyan funding for Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign but that judges weren\u2019t convinced that the conservative leader himself was directly involved in the funding effort or that any Libyan money ended up being used in his winning campaign.",
      "The chief judge, in an hours-long reading of the lengthy verdict, said Sarkozy allowed his close associates to reach out to Libyan authorities \u201cto obtain or try to obtain financial support in Libya for the purpose of securing campaign financing.\u201d",
      "But the court also said it couldn\u2019t determine with certainty that Libyan money ended up financing Sarkozy\u2019s campaign. Still, under French law, a corrupt scheme can still be a crime even if money wasn\u2019t paid or cannot be proven, the court explained.",
      "Sarkozy, accompanied by his wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was present in the courtroom, which was also filled with reporters and members of the public. Sarkozy sat in the front row of the defendant\u2019s seats. His three adult sons were also in the room.",
      "Sarkozy, who was elected in 2007 but lost his bid for reelection in 2012, denied all wrongdoing during a three-month trial earlier this year that also involved 11 co-defendants, including three former ministers.",
      "Despite multiple legal scandals that have clouded his presidential legacy, Sarkozy remains an influential figure in right-wing politics in France and in entertainment circles, by virtue of his marriage to Bruni-Sarkozy.",
      "The accusations trace their roots to 2011, when a Libyan news agency and Gadhafi himself said the Libyan state had secretly funneled millions of euros into Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign.",
      "In 2012, the French investigative outlet Mediapart published what it said was a Libyan intelligence memo referencing a 50 million-euro funding agreement. Sarkozy denounced the document as a forgery and sued for defamation. The court ruled Thursday that it \u201cnow appears most likely that this document is a forgery.\"",

      "In another case, Sarkozy was convicted last year of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid. He was accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount and was sentenced to a year in prison, of which six months were suspended.",
      "Sarkozy has denied the allegations. He has appealed that verdict to the highest Court of Cassation, and that appeal is pending",

He also made pronouncements during his time as grand mufti viewed as sectarian and more following Saudi Arabia's Wahhabism, a strictly austere form of Islam that for decades saw the kingdom segregate the sexes, restrict music and follow other puritanical pursuits.",
      "Saudi Arabia's state media reported Sheikh Abdulaziz's death, without offering a cause. The kingdom's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs the kingdom's day-to-day governance under his 89-year-old father, King Salman, attended funeral prayers for the late mufti on Tuesday night in Riyadh.",
      "\u201cWith his passing, the kingdom and the Islamic world have lost a distinguished scholar who made significant contributions to the service of Islam and Muslims,\u201d the Saudi Royal Court said in a statement.",
      "Sheikh Abdulaziz, who became blind as a young man, became grand mufti in 1999, installed by Saudi King Fahd. At the time, the kingdom remained segregated and its people closely policed by the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. Those views could be seen in the grand mufti's earlier reported comments, such as condemning mobile phone cameras in 2004 for possibly being \u201cexploited to photograph and spread vice in the community.\u201d",
      "Other remarks focused on Christianity. He joined other Islamic leaders in denouncing then-Pope Benedict XVI's 2006 speech quoting a Byzantine emperor as saying some of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s teachings were \u201cevil and inhuman.\u201d In 2012, responding to a question about Christian churches in Kuwait, Sheikh Abdulaziz reportedly said it was \u201cnecessary to destroy all the churches of the region.\" Those around him later sought to walk the remarks back after they drew outrage from Christian leaders.",
      "Sheikh Abdulaziz also targeted the faith of Islam's Shiites after Iran's supreme leader harshly criticized Saudi Arabia's conduct after a crush and stampede at the 2015 Hajj killed more than 2,400 pilgrims.",
      "\u201cWe must understand they are not Muslims, for they are the descendants of Majuws, and their enmity toward Muslims, especially the Sunnis, is very old,\u201d the Saudi cleric reportedly said. \u201cMajuws\u201d is a term that refers to Zoroastrians and those who worship fire.",

The Russian Federation is also in an electoral campaign,\u201d he said in an address after a government session. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we are campaigning in our country, and the Russian Federation wants to campaign not in its own country, but in our country.\u201d",

      "Similar beach structures with similar origins still survive in other parts of the world.",
      "There are no private beaches in Australia, so beach shacks were built on public land. Views have long been mixed on whether such private property has any place on public beaches.",
      "All the sheds have been removed from Australia\u2019s coastline over the decades except for around 2,000 in Melbourne\u2019s vicinity.",
      "The most expensive can be found in the wealthy tourist town of Portsea, a 90-minute drive from Melbourne. Portsea boxes often sell for AU$1 million ($660,000). A record AU$1.2 million ($800,000) was set last year.",
      "The mean price of a Melbourne dwelling was AU$803,194 ($530,378) in August, according to property research firm Cotality.",
      "A record for a box sold outside Portsea was set at Mount Martha, an hour\u2019s drive from Melbourne, in April, after a two-hour auction. Beach Box No. 26 on South Beach sold for AU$1 million ($660,000), which was AU$350,000 ($230,000) more than the expected price advertised by the vendor\u2019s real estate agent, Alex Corradi.",
      "Corradi said there were other boxes, which he calls boatsheds, at Mount Martha with covered decks that would sell for more. Owners can\u2019t add covered decks because a shed\u2019s design and dimensions can\u2019t be altered.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really see them going backwards. I think they will just continue to go up\u201d in price, Corradi said, adding that the banks don\u2019t share that confidence in their value as an investment. \u201cThe banks will not lend against it, so these are all cash buyers.\"",
      "Melbourne property investment adviser Cate Bakos accepts that scarcity will deliver beach box investors a capital gain in the long term. But she is concerned by their investment potential in the shorter term, with no financial return on an ongoing outlay.",
      "\u201cBuying a beach box is, quite frankly, an illogical purchase,\u201d Bakos said.",

      "World Gorilla Day is observed on September 24",
      "BWINDI, Uganda -- Sept. 24 is observed as World Gorilla Day. It was launched in 2017 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of a Rwanda-based gorilla study center founded by Dian Fossey, the American primatologist and conservationist who gained global renown for her research.",
      "The gorillas Fossey studied and looked after were mountain gorillas that belong to the species known as the eastern gorilla and live mostly in the Virunga Massif, a mountainous area encompassing parts of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. The second species, known as the western gorilla, inhabits areas of west and central Africa.",
      "Gorillas are losing their habitat because of poaching and other threats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both gorilla species as endangered, with three of four subspecies critically endangered.",
      "Here are some things to know about the great apes:",
      "Humans share much of their DNA with gorillas, and scientists cite figures showing up to 98% similarity. \u201cGorillas are humans\u2019 closest living relatives after chimpanzees, and are of comparable importance for the study of human origins and evolution,\u201d according to the science journal Nature. This kinship with humans is one reason gorillas are susceptible to infections spread through close contact with tourists, researchers and others who come near them. Gorillas are especially vulnerable to the influenza virus, and respiratory illnesses are a frequent cause of death among adult gorillas.",
      "Visitors tracking gorillas in the wild are usually urged to stand at least 7 meters (yards) from the primates \u2014 as well as not to touch them even if they wander, as they sometimes do, closer to people. In her lifetime, Fossey worried that gorilla tourism was injurious to the well-being of gorillas because it might alter their behavior in the wild, but tourism-driven gorilla conservation projects in countries such as Uganda has proved successful over the years.",

      "Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, home to many of the world's remaining gorillas, has 27 families considered \u201chabituated,\u201d trained to appear comfortable in the presence of humans. Most silverbacks are known to be protective of their families. The silverback in one of the Bwindi families is named Murinzi, a local word for \u201cprotector,\u201d because rangers have seen him to be quite solicitous.",
      "To assert their authority, silverbacks sometimes stand on their hind legs, beat their chests and vocalize, sending younger males in flight and warning rivals from other groups. Gorilla mothers are just as generous with their offspring, and the \u201clove they show for their youngsters is undeniably deep and evident to everyone lucky enough to observe it,\u201d according to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a charity working to protect the primates. Gorillas can live for over 40 years in the wild.",
      "The powerful majesty of gorillas in the wild is one reason they fascinate tourists. But while they are the largest living primates, they can also seem gentle and meek. An average silverback can weigh up to 180 kilograms (396 pounds). Herbivorous creatures, gorillas eat mostly leaves and the shoots and stems of plants. They may also eat ants and snails.",
      "The International Gorilla Conservation Program says the main threat to gorillas is habitat loss from the clearance of the forested ecosystems they inhabit. \u201cConversion of land for agriculture and competition for limited natural resources such as firewood lead to varying degrees of deforestation,\u201d according to the group, a coalition of conservation nonprofits focusing on the survival of mountain gorillas.",

      "NEW YORK -- Did you buy a new pink dress to watch the Barbie movie, only to never wear it again? An Oura ring because your favorite TikTok influencer had it? A new pair of baggy jeans because '90s fashion is making a comeback?",
      "Niche trends fueled by social media can influence your shopping decisions. Participating often brings some happiness and a sense of community, but the problem comes when you do it so often that you\u2019re not using your money to achieve your financial goals, or worse, you get into debt, said Erika Rasure, chief financial wellness advisor for Beyond Finance, a financial services company.",

      "If you find yourself overspending to participate in microtrends, here are some expert recommendations:",
      "Before you click \u201cbuy\u201d on TikTok Shop, it\u2019s best if you take some time to reflect, said Jennifer Seitz, head of education for Greenlight, a financial literacy app for families. Pausing before a purchase can help you discern if the item is something you really want or a fleeting craving.",
      "\u201cThink if you want to put it in a schedule pause, whether it\u2019s 24 hours or even a couple of days if it\u2019s a larger expense,\u2033 Seitz said.",
      "Participating in personal challenges can be a good way to get in the habit of making purchases more deliberate. Back in 2022, Alyssa Barber participated in the no-buy year challenge, where she pledged to stop buying non-essential items for a year.",
      "Barber shares sustainable practices with over 370,000 followers on TikTok, where one of her recurrent themes is how to stop impulse buying. Barber said the challenge gave her perspective on how much she was spending on things she didn\u2019t need. Since then, she has changed her spending habits, focusing mainly on experiences.",
      "Taking a value-based spending approach can help you decide if you should participate in a trend you see online, Rasure said.",
      "If, for example, you want to build an emergency fund, having this goal in mind while shopping can help avoid unnecessary spending.",
      "Quynh Van, a 27-year-old UX designer from Minneapolis, was surprised by the number of ads on TikTok when she created an account after a four-year break from social media. And while being influenced by the ads is inevitable, she believes overspending comes in part from users not having defined goals.",

      "At the same time, Trump\u2019s overall approval has been fairly steady in AP-NORC polling since the beginning of his second term. This month, 39% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling his job as president, which is back in line with his average approval rating after a slight uptick in August. There was a similar pattern during his first White House term, when his approval stayed within a narrow range.",
      "Here are the issues on which he's been strongest and weakest in his second term:",
      "Trump has turned border security into a strength of his second term, a sharp reversal from his first term in office.",
      "Most Americans approve of Trump\u2019s approach to border security. He gets higher marks on that than on his handling of the presidency overall or other issues that had previously been top strengths, including immigration and crime. This has also emerged as a unique strength of his second term. Only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approved of Trump\u2019s approach to border security in 2019, during which time Trump was focused on securing funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "His approval on immigration is slightly lower than it was early in his second term, but it remains a bit higher than his overall job approval.",
      "In March, about half of U.S. adults approved of his handling of immigration. But the most recent measure found his approval on immigration at 43%, just a tick higher than his overall approval rating.",
      "Even with the slight dip, immigration remains a strength in a way it wasn\u2019t in his first term. Throughout his first term, closer to 4 in 10 U.S. adults approved of his immigration approach \u2014 but when he started his second term, it was about half who approved.",
      "Trump has taken firm steps to deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, and the new poll finds that a sizable share of Americans \u2014 about half \u2014 say Trump has \u201cgone too far\u201d in pursuit of that goal, roughly the same share as held that stance in a poll conducted in April.",
      "His approval on how he\u2019s handling crime is also down slightly to 46%, after reaching 53% in August as he deployed the National Guard to Washington. But that still exceeds his overall job approval, and it\u2019s also an advantage among certain groups, like independents. About 4 in 10 independents approve of Trump\u2019s approach to crime, compared with 25% who approve of his approach to the presidency overall.",
      "The economy is often a fraught point for presidents, and there are indications that Americans continue to be concerned about the country\u2019s economic state.",

His approval on this issue varied throughout the pandemic, and about half of Americans approved of his economic approach just before he lost the 2020 presidential election. At that point, however, more Americans were more worried about the coronavirus pandemic than the economy. His approval has been consistently lower in his second term \u2014 when he came into office, only about 4 in 10 approved of how he handled the economy.",

      "Petrichor, by the way, is a pleasant odor after a rainfall following a warm, dry period. Teraflop is a unit of measure for calculating the speed of a computer. Dumbphones are just that, mobile devices we used before the smartphone revolution. And ghost kitchens, which came into their own during the pandemic, are commercial spaces for hire.",

      "For dictionary sales overall, there's a bit of sunshine at Barnes & Noble. The chain's dictionary sales have gone up so far this year over the same period in 2024, said Kat Sarfas, marketing manager for nonfiction.

      "Zavala's family described him as a theme park enthusiast and a gamer with friends worldwide from gaming. He treasured his independence and drove and cooked for himself. He also worked as an employment counselor for people with disabilities, helping them land jobs and then checking on them once they started working. His parents said they never treated him any differently than his sister and brother because of his disability.",

The family's attorneys said they have opened a line of communication with Universal officials, as the family seeks a full investigation into what happened and desires that the ride remain shuttered until there's an understanding of how Zavala died. They also are hiring a team of experts in ride design, safety, manufacturing and operations to guide their own investigation.",

      "\u201cIt would be irresponsible, almost jarring, for us to take off and not acknowledge the traumatic rise in political violence that we\u2019ve seen in our country,\u201d Clinton said about the shooting deaths of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. \u201cWe\u2019re pulling further and further away from one another.\u201d",
      "Clinton said he worried about the dismantling of domestic and foreign assistance programs, \u201cthe war on science and public health,\u201d cuts to education, trade wars, and being \u201cat risk of losing our freedom of speech.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do everything we can to provide a counterweight to a lot of the negative things that have taken place in the last several months,\u201d Clinton said of the two-day conference, which shifted its format to create working groups to tackle many of the issues he outlined.",
      "The conference\u2019s biggest announcement on Wednesday was a partnership between the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Unitaid, and Wits RHI that will provide Gilead Sciences\u2019 HIV prevention drug lenacapavir in 120 low- and middle-income countries for $40 a person each year, starting in 2027. The Gates Foundation announced a similar agreement with the Indian manufacturer Hetero Labs.",
      "Clinton said the move was partially in response to foreign aid cuts from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which he said could lead to more than 6 million more HIV cases and potentially 4 million more deaths in Africa. In July, GOP leaders stopped an additional cut of $400 million to PEPFAR, a program combating HIV/AIDS credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then-President George W. Bush.",

      "\u201cIt seems like America\u2019s withdrawal from the world is having terrible ramifications, in my personal view,\u201d he said, adding that Points of Light hopes to increase the help it provides through its ambitious plan to double the number of volunteers in America in the next 10 years.",

    "story": [
      "A Trump administration decision to repurpose an old chemotherapy drug for autism has surprised many experts \u2014 including the physician who recently proposed the idea",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump's administration announced it would repurpose an old, generic drug as a new treatment for autism, it came as a surprise to many experts \u2014 including the physician who suggested the idea to the nation\u2019s top health officials.",
      "Dr. Richard Frye told The Associated Press that he'd been talking with federal regulators about developing his own customized version of the drug for children with autism, assuming more research would be required.",
      "\u201cSo we were kinda surprised that they were just approving it right out of the gate without more studies or anything,\u201d said Frye, an Arizona-based child neurologist who has a book and online education business focused on the experimental treatment.",
      "It\u2019s another example of the haphazard rollout of the Trump administration\u2019s Monday announcement on autism, which critics say has elevated an unproven drug that needs far more study before being approved as a credible treatment for the complex brain disease.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning.",
      "The nation\u2019s leading autism groups and researchers quickly distanced themselves from the decision on leucovorin, a derivative of vitamin B, calling the studies supporting its use \u201cvery weak\" and \u201dvery small.\"",
      "\u201cWe have nothing resembling even moderate evidence that leucovorin is an effective treatment for autism symptoms,\u201d said David Mandell, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Mandell and other researchers say the evidence suggests autism is mostly rooted in genetics, with input from other factors, including the age of the child's father.",
      "Nevertheless, a growing number of doctors are prescribing the medication, repurposing versions used for chemotherapy or ordering new formulations from compounding pharmacies.",
      "Many researchers agree the drug warrants additional study, particularly for patients with a deficiency of folate, or vitamin B9, in the brain that may play a role in autism. But for now, they say, it should only be taken in carefully controlled clinical trials.",
      "\u201cWe often say our job is to stay between the yellow lines,\" said Dr. Lawrence Gray, a pediatric developmental specialist at Northwestern University. \u201cWhen people just decide to go outside of current guidelines, then they\u2019re outside of that. And nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen out there.\u201d",
      "The case for leucovorin\u2019s use in autism begins with established science but quickly veers into uncertain terrain.",
      "When metabolized, the drug turns into folate, which is essential for healthy prenatal development and is recommended before and during pregnancy. But far less is known about its role after birth.",
      "The issue caught the attention of Frye and others more than 20 years ago, when research suggested some people with autism had low levels of folate in the brain due to antibodies blocking the vitamin's absorption.",
      "The theory linking autism to folate levels was mostly abandoned, however, after research showed that the siblings of people with autism can also have low folates without any symptoms of the condition.",
      "\u201cI honestly thought this had died out as a theory for autism and was shocked to see its reemergence,\u201d Mandell said.",
      "In 2018, Frye and his colleagues published a study of 48 children in which those taking leucovorin performed better on several language measures than those taking a placebo.",
      "Four small studies in other countries, including China and Iran, showed similar results, albeit using different doses, metrics and statistical analyses, which researchers say is problematic.",
      "Frye struggled to get funding to continue within the traditional academic system.",
      "\u201cI decided to move out of academia to be more innovative and actually do some of this stuff,\u201d he said.",
      "Earlier this year, Frye and several other researchers formed a new entity, the Autism Discovery Coalition, to pitch their work to Trump administration officials including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",

      "An August meeting with National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya quickly led to further discussions with the Food and Drug Administration about testing a proprietary, purified version of leucovorin.",
      "A new formulation of the decades-old drug would mean new patents, allowing Frye and his yet-to-formed drug company to charge far more than the cheap generics currently on the market.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of investors who are excited about leucovorin and want to do something high quality for kids with autism,\u201d he said.",
      "But the FDA\u2019s announcement Monday may have scuttled that plan. Instead of previewing a new version, the agency said it would simply update the label on the generic drug to mention use in boosting folate brain levels, including for patients with autism. That\u2019s expected to encourage more doctors to prescribe it and insurers to cover it.",
      "Specialists who have spent decades treating autistic patients say it\u2019s important to proceed carefully and methodically.",

      "Within days, Noonan says, he saw improvement in his son\u2019s ability to make eye contact and form sentences.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not cured, but these are just areas of improvement,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big thing for us.\u201d",

      "Used car shopping doesn\u2019t mean having to skimp when it comes to modern safety features",
      "In recent years, more and more vehicles at all manner of price points have come equipped with an array of advanced driver assistance systems as standard equipment. Studies from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and other organizations have shown that these features can help you keep your attention on the road and even help avoid or reduce the seriousness of a collision.",
      "But shopping for a used vehicle can be tricky. A vehicle from seven years ago, for example, might have one or two features as standard, and then maybe a few more as optional equipment. If you\u2019re buying used, how do you know what to look for? The automotive experts at Edmunds detail the features that they think you most need to know about and provide advice on how to determine if your next used vehicle purchase will have them.",
      "Forward collision warning is an advanced driving aid that can use audio or visual cues to alert a driver if the system detects that a frontal collision is likely or imminent. Systems generally can detect stationary or moving vehicles, and an increasing number can detect pedestrians and cyclists. If the vehicle is approaching a detected object too quickly, the system will issue a warning.",
      "Automatic emergency braking adds another layer of driver assistance. It utilizes the same sensors used for forward collision warning. If the driver doesn\u2019t react in time to the warning, the vehicle can automatically engage its brakes to slow or stop the vehicle before a collision occurs, or at least lessen the severity of the impact.",
      "While these are two separate features, many automakers routinely bundle them together in a specific trim level or option package. Blind-spot warning is likely to be one of the most familiar advanced driver aids. Like the other systems listed here, it relies on a variety of sensors to let the driver know if a vehicle is out of view. A warning is often communicated with a visual cue located in or near the side mirrors, along with some form of audible warning.",
      "Rear cross-traffic alert comes into play when a vehicle is put into reverse. The system emits audible and visual warnings should something or someone undetected approach from either side. This can be valuable when, for example, reversing out of a parking spot and an otherwise unseen vehicle is quickly approaching from either side.",
      "One of the relatively newer features in this lineup of Edmunds-recommended advanced driver aids, reverse automatic emergency braking applies the brakes when the vehicle\u2019s sensor array detects an impending collision with something immediately behind it. The key benefit being that, even if the driver fails to react in time to various in-car warnings, reverse automatic braking is there to take over. This feature could prevent an expensive encounter with something like a concrete wall or pillar in a crowded parking structure.",
      "Even the best drivers can use some extra help parking in snug situations. This is why Edmunds recommends a surround-view camera system. It goes beyond a typical reverse camera in that it provides a bird\u2019s-eye view of the vehicle.",

      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian took the stage at the U_N_ to blast Israeli and U_S_ attacks in June as inflicting \u201ca grievous blow upon international trust and the very prospect of peace in the region.\u201d",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Addressing the world's leaders, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Wednesday blamed the United States and Israeli attacks for \u201cdealing a grievous blow\u201d to peace negotiations as Tehran braces for the reinstatement of sanctions in the next week, barring a last-minute diplomatic breakthrough. Hours before his speech, Iran's rial currency fell to a new all-time low.",
      "Pezeshkian's remarks before the U.N. General Assembly are the first in a global forum since the 12-day Israel-Iran war over the summer that saw the assassination of many of the Islamic Republic\u2019s highest military and political leaders and broke down weeks of negotiations with the United States.",
      "\u201cLadies and gentlemen, you all bore witness that this past June, my country was subjected to a savage aggression and flagrant contravention of the most elementary principles of international law,\u201d said the president, who, within Iran\u2019s political landscape, is considered a moderate politician.",
      "Pezeshkian is in New York as Tehran seeks to engage in last-minute talks with European nations to stop the coming reimposition of U.N. sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. But before even landing in the U.S., any diplomatic efforts planned by Pezeshkian and Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, were overshadowed when Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected any direct nuclear talks with America in a speech on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has announced the results of the talks in advance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is the closure of nuclear activities and enrichment. This is not a negotiation. It is a diktat, an imposition.\u201d",
      "France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the so-called \u201csnapback mechanism\u201d to reinstate sanctions \u2014 barring a last-minute accord \u2014 over Iran\u2019s failure to comply with conditions of a 2015 nuclear deal aimed at preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.",
      "\u201cSnapback\u201d was designed to be veto-proof at the U.N. It started a 30-day window for the resumption of sanctions, which ends Sunday, unless the West and Iran reach a diplomatic agreement.",
      "European nations have said that they would be willing to extend the deadline if Iran resumes direct negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear program, allows U.N. nuclear inspectors access to its nuclear sites, and accounts for the more than 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of highly enriched uranium that the U.N. watchdog says it has. Iran is the only nation in the world that enriches uranium up to 60% \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels \u2014 that doesn\u2019t have a weapons program.",
      "A European diplomat said that the talks in New York between Araghchi and the E3 \u201cdid not produce any new developments, any new results.\u201d Therefore, European sources \u201cexpect that the snapback procedure will continue as planned.\u201d",
      "Pezeshkian used his U.N. speech to criticize the E3 for having operated in \u201cbad faith\u201d for years to dictate Iranian compliance with a deal that the U.S. abandoned in 2018. \u201cThey falsely presented themselves as parties of good standing to the agreement, and they disparaged Iran\u2019s sincere efforts as insufficient,\" he said.",
      "If no diplomatic deal is found this week, the sanctions will automatically \u201csnapback\u201d on Sunday. That would again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran and penalize any development of Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, among other measures, further squeezing the country\u2019s reeling economy.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Even for an agency accustomed to criticism, this summer\u2019s debate over Republicans' big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts was a harsh one for the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "\u201cNotorious for getting it wrong,\u201d was the judgment of Speaker Mike Johnson. \u201cMaking the same mistakes,\u201d was the refrain from House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. And President Donald Trump dismissed the CBO as \u201cvery hostile.\u201d",
      "For CBO Director Phillip Swagel, the \u201cincoming fire,\u201d as he calls it, is simply part of the job.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get it right and inform the Congress and the country,\u201d he said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThere\u2019s no agenda here.\u201d",
      "Tasked with producing nonpartisan analysis for Congress, it\u2019s up to Swagel and expert staffers at the CBO to assess the impact of legislation on economic growth and the nation\u2019s finances \u2014 producing \u201cscores,\u201d in the parlance of Washington, that often reverberate across the dominant political debates of the day. Both major political parties often dispute the agency\u2019s findings, particularly when their top priorities are at stake.",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s noise, sometimes it\u2019s not. But we just tune it out. Here we do our work,\u201d Swagel said. \u201cThe thing that I do care about a lot is to make sure our work is accurate.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a low-key approach Swagel has maintained at the CBO since 2019, when congressional leaders appointed him the director after stints in both Republican and Democratic administrations. An economist by trade, Swagel brings an inquisitive and genial approach to the job, his knowledge of government forged by work at the Council of Economic Advisers in the White House, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund.",
      "\u201cThe challenge of doing analysis now,\u201d Swagel said, \u201cis the changes we\u2019re seeing in our economy are really large.\u201d",
      "From the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation plans, to the unprecedented implementation of sweeping tariffs on countries around the world, to massive tax and spending cuts passed into law this summer, assessing the trajectory of the U.S. economy has grown more difficult.",
      "Swagel recently sat down with the AP to talk at length about analyses from his agency, the future of the nation\u2019s entitlement programs and the pressure to remain unbiased when data itself is at risk of being politicized.",
      "Trump's sweeping tariffs plan has posed challenges to the CBO's standard models for assessing trade.",
      "The baseline tariffs on all countries and higher rates on Trump's \u201cworst offenders\u201d list are different from what \"we\u2019ve seen in more than 100 years,\u201d Swagel said. It's a dramatic shift away from the low-tariff era that has existed since World War II. \"We\u2019re going to be looking carefully to see if those models still apply, or if tariffs that are this large, do those have effects that we just haven\u2019t counted on?\u201d he said.",
      "So far, the CBO estimates the tariffs could reduce the national deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, helping to offset the deficit increases it projects will result from the Republicans\u2019 big bill passed this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge impact,\u201d Swagel said.",
      "The CBO also anticipates Trump's tariffs will cause roughly two years of elevated inflation, Swagel said, causing price increases for businesses and customers. But he says those effects will be temporary.",
      "\u201cAs the tariffs go up and the prices go up with the tariffs, inflation will be higher, but then prices will get to a higher level and be stable,\" he said. \"And then the inflationary impact will subside.\"",
      "Swagel said there are \u201cpros and cons\u201d when assessing how immigration affects the economy.",
      "\u201cImmigrants have added to our labor force, and that has meant higher GDP. It\u2019s meant more revenue and a lower deficit,\u201d Swagel said. \u201cBut, of course, there\u2019s lots of issues related to immigration,\u201d notably that \u201cmore immigrants put more fiscal pressure on state and local governments \u2014 on schools, on police, on health care systems and other things.\u201d",

      "Bourbon production at Buffalo Trace Distillery has been connected to the Kentucky River for decades",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- The long history of bourbon production at Buffalo Trace Distillery has been connected to the Kentucky River \u2014 summed up as a blessing and curse by a plaque on the grounds.",
      "In the 1800s, long before the Buffalo Trace name was attached to the distillery, the river served as a floating highway to bring in grain and other production essentials and to transport barrels of whiskey to markets along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Even today, river water cools down production equipment. But the river flowing past the distillery flashed its destructive side in April.",
      "A massive flood, caused by days of unrelenting rain, sent the Kentucky River surging over its banks, inundating most of the 200-plus-acre distillery grounds on its main campus in Frankfort. Nearly every phase of production was impacted, as were several warehouses where whiskey is aged.",
      "\u201cIt was just something that was hard to process, but we knew we couldn\u2019t take too much time to process it,\" said Tyler Adams, a distillery general manager. He said they had much to do to recover from the reservoir of murky water that swamped the bourbon-making campus.",
      "Five months later, production at the distillery is back to normal, including of some of the most sought-after bourbons. Its lineup includes the namesake flagship brand, Buffalo Trace, as well as Eagle Rare, W.L. Weller and Blanton's. Pappy Van Winkle bourbons are distilled and aged at Buffalo Trace while the Van Winkle family remains in control of the coveted brand.",
      "The distillery recently filled its 9 millionth barrel of bourbon since Prohibition, just two and a half years since filling the 8 millionth barrel. It has also introduced new whiskeys to its catalogue and is renovating a campus building into a cafe and events center.",
      "The cleanup enlisted hundreds of plant employees and contract workers. Buffalo Trace fans swamped the distillery with offers to pitch in, Adams said. The distillery politely declined and suggested they might assist area residents instead.",
      "Crews removed debris, sanitized equipment and pumped out what was left after floodwaters receded. Bourbon barrels swept into the parking lot caught some attention, Adams said. No chance for sneak samples, though \u2014 the barrels were empty.",
      "Few visible reminders remain of that mud-caked, debris-strewn mess.",
      "Some filled whiskey barrels touched by floodwaters were still being cleaned and tested, but the meticulous task of examining thousands of barrels was nearly complete, the distillery said. Quality control assessments found only small amounts of aging whiskey were impacted. High water marks are etched into some buildings and tour guides casually remind visitors of the epic event.",
      "Danny Kahn, a master distiller for Buffalo Trace's parent company, says he still experiences \"a little PTSD\u201d when recalling those frantic days. River flooding has been a sporadic part of the distillery's history \u2014 including big ones in 1937 and 1978, but in early April, the floodwaters surged to previously unseen heights. Buffalo Trace had also just completed a decade-long, $1.2 billion expansion to double distilling capacity.",
      "\u201cIt actually looked kind of calm, but I knew that it was not calm because we could see buildings were under 10 feet (3 meters) of water,\" Kahn said. \"It was really quite overwhelming.\u201d",
      "Activating their flood plans, workers shut down the distillery and did what they could to safeguard equipment. After that, all they could do was watch and wait. Distillery officials observed the devastation from higher ground and via drone footage.",
      "Once the river crested, it took a few days for the floodwaters to fully recede, but operations gradually sprung back to life. Finished whiskey shipped out the day after the rain stopped. Bottling soon resumed and a makeshift gift shop opened until the visitors' center was repaired. Tours eventually resumed. But bourbon production halted for about a month as the cost for cleanup and repairs surpassed $30 million.",

And when we finally got it done, it was really a sigh of relief and we get back to business as normal.\"",
      "For the American whiskey industry as a whole, it's been anything but business as usual.",
      "After years of growth, prospects turned sour for the sector amid sluggish sales and trade uncertainties as President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs.",
      "In 2024, American whiskey sales in the U.S. fell nearly 2%, the first such drop in supplier sales in more than 20 years, the Distilled Spirits Council said. Initial data for the first half of 2025 showed a continued decline, it said. American whiskey exports dropped more than 13% through July of this year compared to the year-ago period, it said. The American whiskey category includes bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey.",
      "Lower domestic sales stem from a mix of market challenges, including supply chain disruptions and changes in consumer purchasing trends, said Chris Swonger, the council's CEO.",
      "\u201cWhile there\u2019s ongoing debate about whether these are temporary headwinds or signs of a more fundamental shift in consumer behavior, large and small distilleries across the country are under pressure,\u201d Swonger said in a statement.",
      "Kentucky distilleries producing such prominent brands as Buffalo Trace, Jim Beam, Maker\u2019s Mark, Woodford Reserve, Wild Turkey and Four Roses can weather downturns better than small producers.",
      "Heaven Hill Brands, another large producer, recently celebrated its new $200 million distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky, taking a long view of market prospects by significantly boosting bourbon capacity.",
      "\u201cAs an independent, family-owned company, we don\u2019t have to chase quarterly trends; we\u2019re building for the next generation,\" said Kate Latts, co-president of Heaven Hill Brands, whose brands include Evan Williams and Elijah Craig. \u201cThis distillery reflects that philosophy.\u201d",
      "At Buffalo Trace, its future is entrenched alongside the Kentucky River, realizing that more floods could come in the years ahead. The distillery learned lessons to be even better prepared next time.",
      "\u201cThis area being a National Historic Landmark, being right on the river, there\u2019s only so much you can do to hold back that water,\" Adams said. \"Your best bet is to prepare for it, do what you can. But holding back that water? It\u2019s really inevitable it\u2019s going to make it into some spaces.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's appointee to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors said Monday that the central bank's key interest rate should be much lower than its current 4.1% level, staking out a position far different than his colleagues.",
      "Stephen Miran, who is also a top economic adviser to Trump, said in remarks to the Economic Club of New York that sharp declines in immigration, rising tariff revenue, and an aging population all suggest that the Fed's rate should be closer to 2.5% instead. According to projections released last week, that's almost a full percentage point lower than any of his 18 colleagues on the Fed's rate-setting committee, an unusually high divergence.",
      "Miran's comments underscore the different perspective he brings to the Fed's deliberations over interest rate policy. His appointment has been controversial because he has kept his position as the head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers while taking unpaid leave, raising concerns about the Fed's traditional independence from day-to-day politics.",
      "His term on the Fed's board expires in January, and Miran has said he expects to return to the White House after that, and is keeping his position because his Fed term is so short. But he could remain on the board until a successor is appointed. There hasn't been a member of the executive branch on the Fed's board since the 1930s.",
      "Concerns about the Fed's independence are heightened because Trump has also repeatedly attacked Chair Jerome Powell and has called for the Fed to reduce its rate to as low as 1.2%. He he is now seeking to fire Lisa Cook, a Fed governor, who has fought her removal in the courts. It is the first time that a president has tried to fire a Fed governor.",

      "SEATTLE -- The surging Seattle Mariners clinched a spot in the postseason on Tuesday night, but they hope the real celebrations are yet to come.",
      "Seattle earned the playoff berth with a dramatic 4-3 win over the Colorado Rockies after getting some help from the New York Yankees, who beat the Chicago White Sox earlier Tuesday. Josh Naylor provided the big hit, a bases-clearing double with two outs in the eighth inning after Seattle had generated little offense against the major league-worst Rockies.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve still got work to do, obviously, but you never know when you\u2019re going to get this opportunity again so we\u2019re going to celebrate tonight,\u201d catcher Cal Raleigh said.",
      "The Mariners now have their eye on their first AL West title since 2001. Seattle moved four games ahead of the Houston Astros \u2014 who lost to the Athletics \u2014 and can wrap up the division as early as Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThis is a special group. They\u2019ve shown it all season long,\u201d manager Dan Wilson said. \u201cThere is a lot of work to do, starting with the division. Hopefully we get that done sooner than later and we keep going. But there is a lot ahead of us, and I think this team is ready and primed for it.\u201d",
      "The Mariners are also in position for the second seed in the American League, and can secure that spot as early as Thursday if they sweep the Rockies. That would give Seattle a first-round playoff bye.",
      "This is the Mariners\u2019 second playoff berth since 2001 and the sixth in franchise history. They ended a 21-year postseason drought in 2022, losing in the divisional round to the Astros. Seattle finished one game out of a wild-card spot in each of the past two seasons.",

That\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking, and we\u2019re not done yet,\u201d Raleigh said. \u201cThe last couple years have just been very painful at the end of the year.

      "The New York Yankees are headed to the playoffs for the eighth time in nine seasons",
      "NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees are headed to the playoffs for the eighth time in nine seasons. But first, there\u2019s plenty to play for over the final days of the regular season.",
      "New York secured its spot in the postseason with a  3-2, come-from-behind win over the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night on Jos\u00e9 Caballero\u2019s RBI single with two out in the ninth inning that scored team captain Aaron Judge with the winning run.",
      "While the win clinched at least an AL wild card, the Yankees (89-68) closed within a game of East Division-leading Toronto (90-67) after the Blue Jays lost 4-1  to Boston. New York and Toronto, which won the season series over the Yankees, have five regular-season games remaining with the division crown very much up for grabs.",
      "\u201cOur ultimate goal is to win our division,\u201d Judge said. \u201cIt\u2019s still right there for us. So we\u2019re excited about getting in, but we got bigger things ahead of us.\u201d",
      "If the Yankees can win the division, they can also secure the best record in the AL for the second straight season, giving them homefield advantage through the AL Championship Series.",
      "New York clinched a postseason berth for the 26th time in 31 seasons. The Yankees have the most postseason appearances since the playoffs were expanded in 1995. The Yankees, Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers are the only teams with eight playoffs appearances in the last nine seasons.",
      "The only time the Yankees missed the playoffs since manager Aaron Boone succeeded Joe Girardi in 2018 was the 2023 season. New York finished with 82 wins and lost Judge for nearly two months after the slugger fractured his toe in a game at Dodger Stadium.",
      "Boone became the third manager in Yankees history to make the playoffs in seven of his first eight seasons, joining Casey Stengel and Joe Torre. Torre reached the playoffs in every season from 1996 to 2007, and Stengel made the playoffs in nine of his first 10 seasons from 1949 to 1960.",
      "\u201cIt just shows you keep playing,\u201d said third baseman Ryan McMahon, who was acquired from Colorado on July 25. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen. We got to take things on our end and hopefully it goes in our favor.\u201d",
      "This playoff berth didn\u2019t come easily \u2014 on Tuesday or throughout the season.",
      "In the ninth inning against Chicago, Anthony Volpe and Austin Wells opened with singles off Brandon Eisert (3-7). After Trent Grisham bounced into a double play, Judge drew his second intentional walk of the game. Cody Bellinger followed with a walk and Volpe scored on a wild pitch by Eisert. Caballero then punctuated a nine-pitch at-bat against Steven Wilson by looping a single that dropped in front of center fielder Brooks Baldwin as Judge scored the winning run.",

      "After the clubhouse celebration ended, the Yankees moved the festivities to the field and posed for a group picture in center field.",
      "After winning their first AL pennant since 2009 last season, the Yankees won 35 of their first 55 games and built a seven-game lead in the AL East. New York went 25-34 through Aug. 5, lost six of seven in Toronto between June 30-July 23 and dropped out of first place on July 3.",
      "\u201cIt's been a challenging year, no question about it,\u201d Boone said",

      "About to catch his Yankees teammate for the first time, the New York catcher couldn't wait to mention the battery word play when he walked into Wednesday's pregame meeting,",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a layup of a joke I had to say it right right when we got in there,\" Rice said after Fried pitched the Yankees over the Chicago White Sox 8-1 and pulled New York into a first-place tie with Toronto.",
      "Fried became the major leagues' first 19-game winner, allowing one run and four hits in seven innings with seven strikeouts and two walks. He is 6-0 with a 1.55 ERA in his last seven starts.",

      "\u201cBen made a joke that it was the first Fried-Rice combo,\u201d Fried said, flashing a small smile as he recalled the exchange.",
      "In his first season with the Yankees after signing a $218 million, eight-year contract, Fried took over as New York's ace when Gerrit Cole had Tommy John surgery. The 31-year-old left-hander will start the Yankees postseason opener next week.",
      "Rice had been thinking of the name combo since last June 23, when he struck out and singled against Fried in a 3-1 loss to Atlanta at Yankee Stadium.",
      "\u201cOn the score bug it was like `Fried Rice' and everyone was loving it so it was just it was too easy to not acknowledge,\u201d Rice said.",
      "Fried is ninth in the major leagues in ERA at 2.86, allowing one earned run or none in 15 on 32 starts. He was 10-2 with a 1.92 ERA in his first 17 outings, was bothered by a blister on his left index finger and went 3-3 with a 6.80 ERA over his next eight outings, then rebounded to go 6-0 with a 1.55 ERA in his last seven.",

      "\u201cIt was fun. wish we got to do it sooner,\u201d he said of catching Fried. \u201cI enjoyed it, enjoyed getting to work with him, kind of getting used to the way his pitches move and his tendencies.\u201d",

      "It can make even longtime New York fans wonder if they can keep hanging in there. John McEnroe questioned why he didn\u2019t switch allegiances after watching the Showtime Lakers when he was living in California and befriended team executive Jeanie Buss, but the Hall of Fame tennis player could never quit the Knicks.",

      "In information distributed among media this week, the SEC stated that while it factored in geography and sought to maintain traditional rivalry games, other aims included increasing the frequency with which teams play all other league schools and promoting competitive balance in a way that might maximize all SEC teams' chances to qualify for the 12-team College Football Playoff.",

      "Before the Pittsburgh Steelers face the Minnesota Vikings at Croke Park in the first regular-season NFL game in Ireland, here are some facts about Gaelic games and the players trying to reach the NFL:",
      "Gaelic football, hurling and camogie (women\u2019s hurling) are the most popular. All three 15-a-side sports are played on a rectangular field with goals and goal posts rising above \u2014 like uprights in American football. In each sport, scoring in the goal is worth three points; through the uprights is one point. Gaelic football recently added a 2-point score for kicks from certain parts of the field.",
      "Gaelic football is a bit like rugby \u2014 no pads and plenty of collisions. It differs in ball movement. Players can possess and advance the ball but must bounce or kick it to themselves at least once every four steps. They can kick or hand pass to teammates. You score primarily by kicking the ball into the net or through the uprights. Like in soccer, free kicks are awarded for fouls. The ball is slightly smaller than a soccer ball.",
      "Hurling and camogie are described as a combination of lacrosse, field hockey and baseball. Helmets and face masks are worn. The ball is called a sliotar. The wooden stick is a hurley. The Gaelic Athletic Association says hurling is \u201c one of the oldest field games in the world ... with the first literary reference dating back to 1272 BC.\u201d",
      "The Irish government offers \" 5 things Americans should know about Gaelic games.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur games are a way of life for a lot of people. They\u2019re the quintessential expression of Irishness for lots of people and Croke Park is the epicenter of that relationship,\u201d GAA head of communications Alan Milton said.",
      "Gaelic games occasionally cross over into popular culture: Irish actor Paul Mescal has popularized GAA shorts.",
      "The GAA, founded in 1884 as part of a revival of Irish nationalism and culture while under British rule, oversees 1,600 local clubs across the island of Ireland and 500 more abroad promoting Gaelic football, hurling, handball and rounders. Camogie and women's Gaelic football have their own organizations but there's an initiative to fully integrate them into the GAA by 2027. The Camogie Association was founded in 1904 when women's sports options were limited.",
      "Gaelic games are amateur sports, so players don't get salaries. Many players have jobs or are university students. Club-level players move up to compete for their counties. The inter-county competitions culminate each summer in the All-Ireland finals, which capture the attention of the nation. Star players can land endorsement deals, but the Gaelic Players Association said typical inter-county athletes lose money each year due to out-of-pocket expenses. For comparison, Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt\u2019s average annual salary is $41 million.",

The Rutgers alum was elevated to the active roster for one game last season and hit a 31-yard field goal in a 27-22 loss to the Washington Commanders.",
      "Charlie Smyth is on the New Orleans Saints practice squad. From County Down in Northern Ireland, Smyth kicked a 52-yard field goal in a preseason game. He came through the NFL's international player pathway program, as did Mark McNamee. The Dubliner is on the practice squad of the Green Bay Packers, who already have Irish-born punter Daniel Whelan \u2014 he moved with his family to the U.S. as a teenager.",
      "There's a trend of Irish kickers and punters in college football, too. Kildare's Sean O\u2019Haire is a kicker for Maryland. Northern Ireland's Adam-McCann Gibbs, who can kick and punt, has committed to Penn State for 2026. Galway native Andy Quinn, whose first love was rugby, is a kicker/punter for Boston College. David Shanahan punted for Georgia Tech. Tadhg Leader runs a program that identifies and trains the Irish hopefuls. Soccer and rugby \u2014 both popular in Ireland \u2014 also offer transferrable foot skills.",

      "\u201cReally proud of the guys here,\u201d said Raleigh, the seventh big league player to reach 60 homers in a season. \u201cIt\u2019s 20-plus years since we\u2019ve done something like this, and it\u2019s special. It\u2019s special to this group, to this organization, to the city.\u201d",
      "Even with that All-Star quintet, the Mariners entered the mid-summer break just six games over. 500, a mark that held prior to the July 31 trade deadline. President of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto felt compelled to add to a team that entered August 4 1/2 games back of the division lead, and did so in a meaningful way.",
      "The Mariners acquired slugging third baseman Eugenio Su\u00e1rez and multi-talented first baseman Josh Naylor from the Arizona Diamondbacks, and getting ahold of both has proven to be quite the shrewd move. Since the deadline, the Mariners have gone 31-17, won 16 of their last 17 and clinched a playoff spot on Tuesday night thanks to some late-game heroics from Naylor.",
      "It hasn\u2019t just been a potent Mariners lineup \u2014 one which entered Wednesday\u2019s game with the third-most homers in the majors \u2014 that has powered the club back to the postseason for the first time since 2022.",
      "Despite injuries to the likes of right-handed starters George Kirby, Bryce Miller, Logan Evans and Logan Gilbert, the Mariners' rotation has held together. Veteran right-hander Luis Castillo has been steady and available all season, while Woo broke out in a big way during his first All-Star campaign.",
      "\"When you look at this team, the depth of our lineup, the depth of our pitching, the bullpen,\u201d manager Dan Wilson said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got incredible guys here.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe care about each other, truly,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cWe would die for each other every single day. It means a lot for a team to be able to be like that.\u201d",

      "Cleveland Guardians designated hitter David Fry is recovering after being hit in the face by a pitch from Detroit\u2019s Tarik Skubal",
      "CLEVELAND -- Cleveland Guardians designated hitter David Fry was released from the hospital Wednesday afternoon and resting comfortably after he was hit in the face by a pitch from Detroit\u2019s Tarik Skubal in the sixth inning of Cleveland\u2019s 5-2 win over the Tigers, a victory that deadlocked the AL Central division race.",
      "Manager Stephen Vogt visited Fry in the hospital Tuesday night and said Fry was in great spirits.",
      "The Guardians said imaging and clinical examination showed Fry sustained multiple, minimally displaced, left-sided facial and nasal fractures. A timeline for recovery is six to eight weeks without the need for surgery.",
      "Fry was placed on the 10-day injured list with outfielder Johnathan Rodr\u00edguez called up from Triple-A Columbus.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a tough kid and we\u2019re just super thankful that he\u2019s home resting,\u201d Vogt said before Wednesday's game. \u201cHis family\u2019s coming to town, so they\u2019ll be back together as a family tonight and it\u2019s going to be a little bit of a journey for him, right? I mean, we don\u2019t know the extent. I mean, we know what\u2019s going on, but it\u2019s going to take some time to really see what\u2019s going on and so he\u2019s going to be out.\u201d",
      "Fry was transported from Lutheran Medical Center to the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus for further testing and observation before being discharged.",
      "Fry squared around to try to bunt a 99 mph fastball from Skubal on Tuesday night and the pitch struck him in the nose and mouth area. As Fry collapsed in the batter\u2019s box and immediately grabbed his bloodied face, a visibly shaken Skubal threw off his glove and cap as Vogt and trainers rushed onto the field.",
      "Fry laid in the dirt for several minutes before being slowly helped to his feet. He gave a thumbs-up signal as he sat up and was driven off in a cart.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t watched the replay. I don\u2019t really care to,\u201d Vogt said. \u201cWhen you put yourself into a position to bunt correctly, you\u2019re putting yourself in a vulnerable position. And he threw a fastball and it just happened to be right at him and there was nothing he could do.\u201d",
      "Skubal, the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, paced around the infield as Fry was being assisted. Following the game, Skubal, who allowed just two hits through the first five innings, said seeing Fry in distress was difficult.",
      "Skubal also visited Fry at the hospital after being brought over by Vogt. Skubal added that Fry texted back today and thanked him for coming to the hospital.",

      "Detroit manager A.J. Hinch also texted with Vogt throughout the night and was happy to hear that Fry is doing better. Hinch said he wasn't surprised to hear about Skubal's visit to the hospital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very important for players to take care of players and us to be people,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cTarik cares about people first. The competition is super important to everybody, but it does stop the moment when you know a guy is hurt like that.\u201d",

      "Humans first began foraging for food some 12,000 years ago, long before they developed agricultural tools that overshadowed the ancient act that helped sustain early humans",
      "PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- Standing barefoot in a grassy patch of dandelions, Iris Phoebe Weaver excitedly begins listing the many ways the modest plant can be used medicinally and in cooking.",
      "\u201cI just picked a bunch of dandelion flowers yesterday and threw them in vodka with some orange peel and some sugar, and that\u2019s my dandelion aperitif,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThat will make a lovely mixed drink at some point.\u201d",
      "A longtime herbalist and foraging instructor in Massachusetts, Weaver takes people on nature walks that transform their relationships with their surroundings. Lately, she's been encouraged by the uptick in interest in foraging, a trend she sees as benefiting the environment, community and people.",
      "\u201cThere is just an amazing amount of food that is around us,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThere is so much abundance that we don\u2019t even understand.\u201d",
      "Humans have been foraging long before they developed the agricultural tools some 12,000 years ago that quickly overshadowed the ancient act that helped sustain early humans. Yet foraging enthusiasts say the search for wild mushrooms, edible plants, shellfish and seaweed has grown more popular in recent years as people tout their rare finds. Others share knowledge on social media, and experienced foragers offer training to novices on safe and sustainable practices.",
      "The renewed interest ranges from those wanting to be budget-conscious \u2014 foraging is free after all \u2014 to those wanting to be more mindful of their environmental footprint. Some even use foraging as a creative outlet, using mushrooms they find to create spore prints and other art.",
      "The popularity is also helped by the hobby's accessibility. Foragers can look for wild food everywhere, from urban landscapes to abandoned farmlands to forests \u2014 they just need permission from a private landowner or to secure the right permit from a state or federal park. Some advocates have even launched a map highlighting where people can pick fruits and vegetables for free.",
      "Gina Buelow, a natural resources field specialist with the Iowa University Extension Program, says the university has had a backlog of folks eager to learn more about foraging mushrooms for the past two years. Buelow runs presentations and field guide days throughout the state, regularly meeting the attendance cap of 30 in both rural and urban counties.",
      "\u201cTypically, I would get usually older women for a master gardener or pollinator garden class. That audience still shows up to these mushrooms programs, but they bring their husbands. And a lot of people between the ages of 20 and 30 years old are really interested in this topic, as well,\u201d she said.",
      "Some creative chefs are also sparking interest in foraging as they expose patrons to exotic and surprisingly tasty ingredients found locally.",
      "\u201cForaging is an ancient concept,\u201d said Evan Mallett, chef and owner of the Black Trumpet Bistro in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a popular historic New England destination. \u201cOur culture has moved far away from foraging and is fortunately coming back into it now.\u201d",
      "Mallett opened the restaurant nearly 20 years ago and uses foods foraged from around Portsmouth. He said he hopes more people will continue to learn about foraging, and encouraged those worried about picking something poisonous to find a mentor.",

      "BWINDI, Uganda -- Sept. 24 is observed as World Gorilla Day. It was launched in 2017 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of a Rwanda-based gorilla study center founded by Dian Fossey, the American primatologist and conservationist who gained global renown for her research.",
      "The gorillas Fossey studied and looked after were mountain gorillas that belong to the species known as the eastern gorilla and live mostly in the Virunga Massif, a mountainous area encompassing parts of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. The second species, known as the western gorilla, inhabits areas of west and central Africa.",
      "Gorillas are losing their habitat because of poaching and other threats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both gorilla species as endangered, with three of four subspecies critically endangered.",
      "Here are some things to know about the great apes:",
      "Humans share much of their DNA with gorillas, and scientists cite figures showing up to 98% similarity. \u201cGorillas are humans\u2019 closest living relatives after chimpanzees, and are of comparable importance for the study of human origins and evolution,\u201d according to the science journal Nature. This kinship with humans is one reason gorillas are susceptible to infections spread through close contact with tourists, researchers and others who come near them. Gorillas are especially vulnerable to the influenza virus, and respiratory illnesses are a frequent cause of death among adult gorillas.",
      "Visitors tracking gorillas in the wild are usually urged to stand at least 7 meters (yards) from the primates \u2014 as well as not to touch them even if they wander, as they sometimes do, closer to people. In her lifetime, Fossey worried that gorilla tourism was injurious to the well-being of gorillas because it might alter their behavior in the wild, but tourism-driven gorilla conservation projects in countries such as Uganda has proved successful over the years.",

      "Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, home to many of the world's remaining gorillas, has 27 families considered \u201chabituated,\u201d trained to appear comfortable in the presence of humans. Most silverbacks are known to be protective of their families. The silverback in one of the Bwindi families is named Murinzi, a local word for \u201cprotector,\u201d because rangers have seen him to be quite solicitous.",
      "To assert their authority, silverbacks sometimes stand on their hind legs, beat their chests and vocalize, sending younger males in flight and warning rivals from other groups. Gorilla mothers are just as generous with their offspring, and the \u201clove they show for their youngsters is undeniably deep and evident to everyone lucky enough to observe it,\u201d according to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a charity working to protect the primates. Gorillas can live for over 40 years in the wild.",
      "The powerful majesty of gorillas in the wild is one reason they fascinate tourists. But while they are the largest living primates, they can also seem gentle and meek. An average silverback can weigh up to 180 kilograms (396 pounds). Herbivorous creatures, gorillas eat mostly leaves and the shoots and stems of plants. They may also eat ants and snails.",
      "The International Gorilla Conservation Program says the main threat to gorillas is habitat loss from the clearance of the forested ecosystems they inhabit. \u201cConversion of land for agriculture and competition for limited natural resources such as firewood lead to varying degrees of deforestation,\u201d according to the group, a coalition of conservation nonprofits focusing on the survival of mountain gorillas.",

      "Gore, who started Climate TRACE, which uses satellites to monitor the location of heat-trapping methane sources, on Wednesday expanded his system to track the source and plume of pollution from tiny particles, often referred to as soot, on a neighborhood basis for 2,500 cities across the world. Particle pollution kills millions of people worldwide each year \u2014 and tens of thousands in the United States \u2014 according to scientific studies and reports.",
      "Gore's coalition uses 300 satellites, 30,000 ground-tracking sensors and artificial intelligence to track 137,095 sources of particle pollution, with 3,937 of them categorized as \u201csuper emitters\u201d for how much they spew. Users can look at long-term trends, but in about a year Gore hopes these can become available daily so they can be incorporated into weather apps, like allergy reports.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, before AI, for people to really see precisely where this conventional air pollution is coming from,\u201d Gore said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s over in their homes and in their neighborhoods and when people have a very clear idea of this, then I think they\u2019re empowered with the truth of their situation.

      "The gamer's ears \u2014 and those of other \u201cTomb Raider\" fans \u2014 picked up something amiss with the French-language voice of Lara Croft, the game\u2019s protagonist.",
      "It sounded robotic, lifeless even \u2014 shorn of the warmth, grace and believability that French voice actor Fran\u00e7oise Cadol has given to Croft since she started playing the character in 1996.",
      "Gamers and Cadol herself came to the same conclusion: A machine had cloned her voice and replaced her.",
      "\u201cIt's pathetic,\" says Cadol, who straight away called her lawyer. \u201cMy voice belongs to me. You have no right to do that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was absolutely scandalous,\u201d says Bos. \u201cIt was artificial intelligence.\u201d",
      "Aspyr, the game developer based in Austin, Texas, didn\u2019t respond to e-mailed questions from The Associated Press. But it acknowledged in a post last week on its website that what it described as \u201cunauthorized AI generated content\u201d had been incorporated into its Aug. 14 update of \u201cTomb Raider IV\u2013VI Remastered\" that angered fans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content,\u201d Aspyr's post said. \u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d",
      "Still, the affair has triggered alarms in the voiceover community, with campaigners saying it's a sobering example of dangers that AI poses to human workers and their jobs.",
      "\u201cIf we can replace actors, we\u2019ll be able to replace accountants, and a whole range of other professions that could also be automated,\" says Patrick Kuban, a French-language voice actor who is also a co-president of United Voice Artists, an international federation of voiceover artists.",
      "\"So we need to ask ourselves the right questions: How far should we go, and how do we regulate these machines?\"",
      "Hollywood has seen similar concerns, with video game performers striking for 11 months for a new contract this year that included AI guardrails.",
      "\u201cThis is happening pretty much everywhere. We\u2019re getting alerts from all over the world \u2014 from Brazil to Taiwan,\u201d Kuban said in an Associated Press interview.",

      "\u201cActors\u2019 voices are being captured, either to create voice clones \u2014 not perfect ones \u2014 but for illicit use on social media by individuals, since there are now many apps for making audio deepfakes,\" Kuban said.",
      "\u201cThese voices are also being used by content producers who aren\u2019t necessarily in the same country,\" he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s very difficult for actors to reclaim control over their voices, to block these uses.\u201d",
      "Cadol says that within minutes of the release of the \u201cTomb Raider\u201d update, her phone began erupting with messages, emails and social media notifications from upset fans.",
      "\u201cI took a look and I saw all this emotion \u2014 anger, sadness, confusion. And that's how I found out that my voice had been cloned,\u201d she said in an AP interview.",
      "Cadol says 12 years of recording French-language voiceovers for Lara Croft \u2014 from 1996 to 2008 \u2014 built an intimate bond with her fans. She calls them the \u201cguardians\u201d of her work.",
      "Once the initial shock subsided, she resolved to fight back. Her Paris lawyer, Jonathan Elkaim, is seeking an apology from Aspyr and financial redress.",
      "In the update, new chunks of voiceover appear to have been added to genuine recordings that Cadol says she made years ago.",
      "Most notably, fans picked up on one particularly awkward segment. In it, a voice instructs players how to use their game controllers to make Lara Croft climb onto an obstacle, intoning in French: \u201cPlace toi devant et appuyez sur avancer\u201d \u2014 Stand in front and press \u2018advance.'",
      "Not only does it sound clunky but it also rings as grammatically incorrect to French speakers \u2014 mixing up the polite and less polite forms of language that they use, depending on who they're addressing.",
      "Gamers were up in arms. Bos posted a video on his YouTube channel that same evening, lamenting: \"It\u2019s half Fran\u00e7oise Cadol, half AI. It\u2019s horrible ! Why have they done that?\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really disgusted,\u201d the 34-year-old said in an AP interview. \u201cI grew up with Fran\u00e7oise Cadol's voice. I've been a \u2018Tomb Raider\u2019 fan since I was young kid.\"",
      "\u201cLara Croft is a bit \u2014 how should I say \u2014 a bit sarcastic at times in some of her lines. And I think Fran\u00e7oise played that very, very well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why now is the time to set boundaries,\" he added. \u201cIt\u2019s so that future generations also have the chance to experience talented actors.\"",

      "Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow",
      "VINSKI, Estonia -- Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow. But those defenses won\u2019t guard against the threat it and its NATO allies face from Russian drones and electronic warfare.",
      "From the Baltic to the Black Sea, countries bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are facing the spillover from Moscow's war in Ukraine.",
      "The incursion of about 20 Russian drones into Poland this month shone a spotlight on holes in NATO's air defenses, as multimillion-dollar jets had to be scrambled to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Russia denied that it targeted Poland, but Polish officials suggested it was intentional.",
      "Faced with a growing problem, some EU defense ministers will meet Friday to discuss creating a \u201cdrone wall.\"",
      "NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it would defend against any further breaches of its airspace after Estonia said Russian fighter jets violated it last week. But although the alliance knows how to identify threats from jets and missiles, dealing with drones is a greater challenge, officials said.",
      "In Poland, \u201cmost of the drones were not detected,\" said Hanno Pevkur, Estonia\u2019s defense minister. \u201cThis is a real gap we have to solve.\u201d",
      "Military and defense officials from the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 NATO and EU members that border Russia \u2014 told The Associated Press that defending against drones requires solving a complex set of technological, financial and bureaucratic problems.",
      "Europe needs cheaper technology to buy and to speed up slow production and procurement cycles, they said. But even then, drone technology is advancing so quickly that anything bought now could be outdated in months.",
      "\u201cWhat I need,\u201d said Lt. General Andrus Merilo who commands Estonia's military, is technology that is \u201cgood enough, it\u2019s affordable and can be produced in mass.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t need high-end capabilities of which I can fire only one, against targets which will be attacking in hundreds,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia is using drones every night in Ukraine because each drone is a \u201clottery ticket that always wins,\u201d said Kusti Salm a former top official at Estonia\u2019s Defense Ministry.",
      "That\u2019s because a drone either hits something or, if Ukraine shoots it down with a missile, it drains Kyiv's air defenses and finances, since missiles are more expensive than drones, said Salm who now runs Frankenburg Technologies, a company developing low-cost anti-drone missiles.",
      "Although NATO countries have a \u201cvery good understanding\u201d of how to defend against conventional threats such as missiles and planes, they need to rapidly improve at dealing with drone threats, said Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania\u2019s vice-minister of national defense.",
      "When the Russian drones flew into Poland, NATO nations deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters and put missile defense systems on alert. But none of those options was specifically designed for drone warfare.",
      "Although Russia and Ukraine have been firing more and more drones at each other, there has been less investment in counter-drone systems, said Salm. He suggested that's partly because it's easier to get a drone to fly than it is to develop something to detect or intercept it.",
      "Slow, low-flying drones made from wood, fiberglass, plastic or polystyrene might not be detected by radar systems searching for a fast-moving missile made of metal, or they might look like birds or a plane. Enemy operatives can also bypass defenses by launching drones from inside a country, as Ukraine did to devastating effect when it attacked Russian airfields this year.",
      "There are also other technological hurdles, including trying to jam the enemy\u2019s drones and communications without cutting your own, Merilo said.",
      "In August, a Ukrainian drone \u2014 possibly sent off course by Russian electronic jamming \u2014 landed in a field in southeastern Estonia. It crashed because the military wasn't capable of detecting it, Merilo said.",

      "\u201cDrones are not mosquitoes,\u201d the Estonian minister said, suggesting they would be unlikely to be zapped by an \u201celectronic wall\u201d along NATO\u2019s borders.",
      "There are many types of drones, including those used for intelligence and reconnaissance, that fly at high-altitude, that are used in attacks, or that even remain attached to a thin fiber-optic cable while flying, making them impossible to jam. Russia also uses decoy drones in Ukraine that carry no payload and are designed to exhaust air defenses.",
      "Any plan to defend against drones needs a multilayered approach including sensors, \u201celectronic warfare \u2026 also low-cost small missiles or attack drones,\u201d said Merilo.",
      "Although the need for better drone defenses isn't new, it\u2019s still largely only possible to buy systems that are \u201creally expensive,\u201d take a long time to develop and cannot be mass-produced, Merilo said.",
      "He suggested that\u2019s partly because big defense companies that have spent decades developing billion-dollar air defense systems might not want something new \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 on the market.",
      "\u201cWe have to understand this game,\u201d Merilo said, adding that some technology does exist, but \u201cthe question is who \u2014 and how fast they can start producing.\u201d",
      "Facing nightly onslaughts, Ukraine is rapidly developing its technology, including long-range attack drones and smaller ones for use on the frontlines.",
      "Latvia and some other NATO countries have turned to Salm's company, Frankenburg, to acquire its small anti-drone missiles once they're in production.",
      "But a piecemeal approach isn't ideal, Salm said. Instead, the EU needs to invest more in European startups which can turbocharge drone defense production that can be used by allies across different weapons systems, he said.",
      "Europe needs to switch to \u201csemi-wartime thinking\u201d and foster greater collaboration between the military, government and defense industries to be able to fill its technology gap, said Godliauskas.",
      "In Ukraine, it's sometimes only a matter of weeks between drone technology being developed and used on the battlefield. Europe \u201cdoesn't have time\u201d to spend years waiting to acquire equipment, the Lithuanian said.",
      "Another lesson from Ukraine is that what works today, might not work tomorrow, Godliauskas noted.",
      "While drone defense is critical now, it would be wrong to forget about everything else, said T\u016btins. That's because Moscow is using \u201call means possible\u201d to destabilize Europe, including hybrid warfare and cyberattacks, he said.",

      "BWINDI, Uganda -- News of a sick or injured mountain gorilla can worry local residents in this mountainous area that\u2019s home to the endangered species. That\u2019s partly because most of the gorillas have been given names, allowing rangers and others to humanize the animal's suffering.",
      "But widespread interest in protecting mountain gorillas also comes from the economic benefits of tourism that have turned poachers into conservationists, married women into porters and rangers into eloquent spokespeople for the great apes.",

It\u2019s suffering from what?\u2019\u201d said Joyleen Tugume, a ranger-guide in Uganda\u2019s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. \u201cEven the community people. Everyone is touched.\u201d",

      "Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in a remote part of southwestern Uganda, is home to many groups of habituated gorillas that have become comfortable in the presence of humans.",
      "Tourists pay a considerable sum \u2014 $800 in permit fees per foreign non-resident \u2014 for the right to see gorillas in their natural habitat. An official revenue-sharing policy channels $10 from each permit back to the local community via their elected leaders, who can invest in projects ranging from water provision to health care. Local communities are also entitled to 20% of all park entry fees generated annually.",
      "Many locals, including reformed poachers living near the park, told The Associated Press that the money generated has ensured the recovery of the species, with habitat encroachment and poaching in decline as wildlife authorities seek to collaborate more with nearby communities.",
      "Philemon Mujuni, a poacher until five years ago, said he once thought of the gorilla as a hostile animal to be killed before it killed him if he ever encountered one. As a boy, he used to follow his father, whom he described as \u201ca senior poacher,\u201d into the forest to help carry the antelopes they pulled from traps.",
      "But in 2020, when poachers killed a beloved gorilla named Rafiki, Mujuni and others formed an organization of former poachers who now say the primates are more important than any other animal.",
      "They serve as community watchdogs, looking out for people who might venture into the forest to set duiker traps that sometimes ensnare gorillas. Their surveillance efforts help support the work of armed rangers who also regularly patrol the park.",
      "\u201cWhen community conservation rangers sensitized us, we said, \u2018Let us reform and stop poaching in the national park of Bwindi,\u2019\u201d Mujuni said. \u201cI can\u2019t go there. Because, through the conservation team from (Bwindi Impenetrable National Park), we get some money from these gorillas we could kill.\u201d",
      "Peter Tumwesigye, one of 128 members of the group of reformed poachers, said gorillas are so important that people whose actions lead to a gorilla's death should be jailed.",
      "\u201cSo that others can learn and never do it again,\u201d he said.",

      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature, which maintains a list of threatened species, cites the mountain gorilla as endangered, an improvement from its earlier designation as critically endangered. About half of the gorillas live in Uganda.",
      "Besides Bwindi, the only other Ugandan park where gorillas can be tracked in the wild is Mgahinga Gorilla National Park. But that protected area has just one family of gorillas, while Bwindi has 27 groups that can be seen up close by visitors.",

      "The session at this week\u2019s annual high-level United Nations meetup showcased the global awareness of AI\u2019s power, with leaders addressing the possible benefits in areas like medical research and international, in equal measure with warnings for its ability to create and spread misinformation and other ills.",
      "\u201cDeep AI analysis of situation data holds this promise for peace,\u201d said British Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy, heralding AI's ability to keep \u201cultra-accurate, real-time logistics, ultra-accurate real-time sentiment analysis, ultra-early warning systems.\u201d",
      "But Lammy warned of the \u201cchallenges for armed conflict,\u201d such as \"the risk of miscalculation, the risk of unintended escalation, and the arrival of artificial intelligence-powered chat bots stirring conflict.\u201d",
      "Since the AI boom kicked off with ChatGPT\u2019s debut about three years ago, the technology\u2019s breathtaking capabilities have amazed the world. Tech companies have raced to develop better AI systems even as experts warn of its risks, including existential threats like engineered pandemics, large-scale misinformation or rogue AIs running out of control, and call for safeguards.",
      "The U.N.\u2019s adoption of a new governance architecture is the latest and biggest effort to rein in AI. Previous multilateral efforts, including three AI summits organized by Britain, South Korea and France, have resulted only in non-binding pledges.",

      "Wednesday's open debate centered around how the Council can help ensure the responsible application of AI to comply with international law and support peace processes and conflict prevention.",
      "Several, including Sierra Leone Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy Kabba, stressed the need for the Council to lead the way on ensuring that AI is not used by militaries without human oversight, so as to avert potentially devastating escalations or misfires.",
      "\u201cThe Council can encourage best practices in peace operations, promote safeguards to retain human agency in military uses, and ensure compliance with international law and international humanitarian law,\u201d Kabba said.",

      "ABILENE, Texas -- The afternoon sun was so hot that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman traded his usual crewneck sweater for a T-shirt on the last legs of a Tuesday visit to the massive Stargate artificial intelligence data center complex that will power the future of ChatGPT.",
      "OpenAI announced Tuesday that its flagship AI data center in Texas will be joined by five others around the U.S. as the ChatGPT maker aims to make good on the $500 billion infrastructure investment promoted by President Donald Trump earlier this year.",

More recently, OpenAI signed a $300 billion deal to buy computing capacity from Oracle. It's a huge bet for the San Francisco-based AI startup, which was founded as a nonprofit.",
      "OpenAI and Oracle invited media and politicians, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to tour the site for the first time Tuesday.",
      "Cruz called Texas \u201cground zero for AI\u201d because if \u201cyou\u2019re building a data center, what do you want? No. 1, you want abundant, low-cost energy.\u201d",

      "Major League Baseball's 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026.",
      "Human plate umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams can challenge two calls per game and get additional appeals in extra innings. Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter \u2014 signaled by tapping their helmet or cap \u2014 and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.",
      "New York Yankees outfielder Austin Slater, one of four players on the competition committee, said three voted in favor after getting support from 22 of the 30 teams. All six management reps voted in favor.",
      "\u201cI think with any sort of technology, there\u2019s not 100% certainty of the accurateness of the system,\u201d Slater said. \u201cI think the same can be said of umpires. So I think it\u2019s just coming to grips with the impact that technology is going to have and whether or not we were willing to live with that error that was associated with the system, even if the error is very, very miniscule.\u201d",
      "Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.",
      "Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.",
      "Yankees manager Aaron Boone, who leads the American League in ejections for the fifth straight year, called the adoption \u201cinevitable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThroughout the year, I\u2019ve been a little not totally on board with it or exactly how it\u2019s going to be implemented but it\u2019s going to be here and hopefully that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \"A lot of the things that Major League Baseball has done I think have been really successful in the changes they\u2019ve made and hopefully this is another one of them.\u201d",
      "Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said players will have to adjust.",
      "\u201cYou can like it, dislike it, it doesn\u2019t matter,\" Vogt said as Cleveland prepared to open a critical three-game series with Detroit. \"It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s going to change the game. It\u2019s going to change the game forever.\u201d",
      "ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that year's Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.",
      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182).",
      "\u201cI love it. I loved it in spring training,\u201d Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. \u201cNot all of the players, but most of the players, if you ask them, they really liked it too. I think it keeps everybody accountable. It keeps everybody on their toes.\u201d",
      "At Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.",

      "Teams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. The proposal approved Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don't have challenges remaining.",
      "MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",
      "\u201cThroughout this process we have worked on deploying the system in a way that\u2019s acceptable to players,\u201d Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \u201cThe strong preference from players for the challenge format over using the technology to call every pitch was a key factor in determining the system we are announcing today.\u201d",
      "This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, larger bases, and restrictions on defensive shifts and pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts.",
      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers, and there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a really good eye ... only getting two (challenges), I think a lot of the borderline ones are going to stay the same,\u201d Rangers catcher Kyle Higashioka said. \u201cSo it keeps some of the human element in in the game.\u201d",

      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina that may have used its long arms and claws to capture prey",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet (7 meters) long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what\u2019s now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \u201chuge and very powerful claws,\u201d said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \u201cfills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\u201d Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Secret Service has found and is quietly dismantling a massive network of \u201cSIM farms\u201d across the New York area just as world leaders gather for meetings at the United Nations.",
      "Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service\u2019s New York field office, said agents found multiple sites filled with servers and stacked SIM cards, of which more than 100,000 cards were already active. Though the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, he described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise and possibly run by nation-state actors \u2014 perpetrators from particular countries.",
      "Officials also warned of the havoc the network could have caused if left intact. McCool compared the potential impact to the cellular blackouts that followed the Sept. 11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing, when networks collapsed under strain.",
      "So what are these SIM farms and what are they capable of?",
      "SIM farms are hardware devices that can hold numerous SIM cards from different mobile operators. These devices then exploit voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology to send and receive bulk messages or calls.",
      "While initially developed for legitimate purposes, such as low cost international calling, the technology has become a cornerstone of organized fraud targeting mass audiences \u2014 phishing texts and scam calls.",
      "\u201cScams have become so sophisticated now. Phishing emails, texts, spoofing caller ID, all of this technology gives scammers that edge,\u201d said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center.",

      "Anthony J. Ferrante, the global head of the cybersecurity practice at FTI, an international consulting firm, said the photos show a very sophisticated and established SIM farm that could be used for any number of nefarious activities, including the potential to overwhelm cellular networks with millions of calls in just a few minutes.",
      "\u201cSo if you can imagine that type of magnitude on cellular networks, it would just overwhelm them and cause them to shut down,\u201d Ferrante said in an interview. He also notes that it's possible the system could be used for surveillance operations, given its proximity to the United Nations, \u201cpotentially that equipment could be used to either intercept communications, eavesdrop on communications, or actually, clone devices, as well.\u201d",
      "Ferrante, who previously served in key security positions at the White House and the FBI, says he's awaiting the results of the investigation before drawing any conclusions about the nature of the setup, but he emphasizes that the scale of the operation shows how simple tools can pose real risks to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThe masterminds could have set this up a long time ago and be operating from thousands of miles away,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a stark reminder of how deeply interconnected our world has become, where local vulnerabilities can be exploited globally.\u201d",

      "Robot umpires are coming to the big leagues in 2026 after Major League Baseball\u2019s 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Robot umpires are coming to the big leagues in 2026 after Major League Baseball\u2019s 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System.",
      "ABS will be introduced in the form of a challenge system in which the human umpire makes each call, which can be appealed to the computer. Robot umpires have been tested in the minor leagues since 2019, with recent testing done at Triple-A since 2022, MLB spring training this year and at this summer's All-Star Game in Atlanta.",
      "Here's what to know about MLB's robot umps.",
      "Stadiums are outfitted with cameras that track each pitch and judge whether it crossed home plate within the strike zone. In early testing, umpires wore ear buds and would hear \u201cball\u201d or \u201cstrike,\u201d then relay that to players and fans with traditional hand signals.",
      "The challenge system adds a wrinkle. Human umps call every pitch, but each team has the ability to challenge two calls per game. Teams that burn their challenges get one additional challenge in each extra inning. A team retains its challenge if successful, similar to the regulations for big league teams with video reviews, which were first used for home run calls in August 2008 and widely expanded to many calls for the 2014 season.",
      "Only a batter, pitcher or catcher may challenge a call, signaling with the tap of a helmet or cap; and assistance from the dugout is not allowed. A challenge must be made within 2 seconds, and the graphic of the pitch and strike zone is shown on the scoreboard and broadcast feed. The umpire then announces the updated count.",
      "MLB estimates the process averages 17 seconds.",
      "A Hawk-Eye pose-tracking system of cameras tracks pitches and whether they are within a strike zone based on the height of each batter, who is measured without shoes before a team\u2019s first test game. MLB estimated the calibration process at less than one minute for each player.",
      "While the strike zone actually called by big league umpires tends to be oval in shape, the ABS strike zone is a rectangle, as in the rule book.",
      "Developing a consensus on what a computer strike zone should be has been an issue.",
      "MLB has changed the shape of the ABS strike zone several times.",
      "It started with a 19-inch width in 2022, then dropped it to 17 inches \u2014 matching the width of home plate. Narrowing the strike zone led to an increase in walks and only small changes in strikeout rates.",

      "ABS makes the ball/strike decision at the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. The contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube and a strike is a pitch that crosses any part. Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.",
      "ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that\u2019s year Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.",
      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.",
      "At this year's MLB All-Star Game, four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna\u2019s calls were successful.",
      "Success rate have hovered around 50% in the minors. At Triple-A this season, the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%.

      "Challenge percentages were higher later in the game. While 1.9% of pitches were challenged in the first three innings, 2.5% were challenged from the fourth through the sixth, 2.8% in the seventh and eighth and 3.6% in the ninth.",

      "World leaders at the United Nations General Assembly have spoken out against the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, as well as divisive reaction to it",
      "The reaction over Charlie Kirk's assassination touched yet another constituency this week: the collection of world leaders gathered at the United Nations.",
      "Two weeks after Kirk was shot and killed in Utah, several of the world leaders gathered at for the U.N. General Assembly this week referenced the conservative activist's slaying \u2014 and some of the divisive outpouring of reaction to it \u2014 as evidence of deeper fissures in global society.",
      "Decrying the \u201csick expression of joy for the crime committed against an innocent person,\u201d Serbian President Alexsandar Vucic told assembled leaders on Wednesday that reaction to Kirk\u2019s death represents \u201cthe best confirmation of that.\u201d",
      "Social media lit up in the days after Kirk\u2019s Sept. 10 death with people mourning his loss \u2014 some of whom said they disagreed with Kirk\u2019s ideological stances but supported his right to voice them \u2014 as well as those celebrating it.",
      "It set off a national discussion about freedom of speech. Comments led to the firings of numerous people, from political analysts and opinion writers to school employees. Several conservative activists sought to identify social media users whose posts about Kirk they viewed as offensive or celebratory, targeting everyone from journalists to teachers.",
      "On Wednesday, Vucic said reaction to the conservative activist\u2019s assassination was demarcated \u201cless by ideological but much more by emotional hate driven differences.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch a development devastates in a deepest and clearest way the world political community much more than conflicts with clear and visible actors,\u201d Vucic said, remarking on how such a seemingly singular event can evoke such strong reactions across the globe.",
      "\u201cHe was savagely assassinated just because his killer did not like his ideas,\u201d Vucic said of Kirk, suggesting that some of the reaction in the slaying's aftermath caused yet more damage in terms of the division it sowed. \"He was shot even after death by the same ones who had prepared political and media grounds for his assassination.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe takeaway is pretty clear,\u201d Smith said: Public school enrollment is declining. \u201cIt\u2019s going to continue to fall for years to come. And so generally, state and local policymakers have to adapt to this new reality.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has refused to reinstate eight former inspectors general who sued after the Trump administration fired them with no warning and little explanation",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge refused on Wednesday to reinstate eight former inspectors general who filed a lawsuit after the Trump administration fired them with no warning and little explanation.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said that while President Donald Trump likely violated the federal law governing the process for removing the non-partisan watchdogs from office, the firings didn\u2019t cause enough irreparable harm to justify reinstating the watchdogs before the lawsuit is resolved.",
      "The eight plaintiffs were among 17 inspectors general who were fired by Trump on Jan. 24. Each received identical two-sentence emails from the White House that attributed their removal to unspecified \u201cchanging priorities.\u201d The mass firings targeted all but two of the cabinet agencies\u2019 inspectors general.",
      "Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys said the firings were unlawful because the administration didn\u2019t give Congress the legally required 30-day notice or provide a \u201csubstantive, case-specific rationale\u201d for removing them.",
      "Government attorneys said the president can remove inspectors general \u201c without any showing of cause \u201d and doesn\u2019t have to wait 30 days after providing notice to Congress.",
      "The judge noted that even if the inspectors general were reinstated, Trump could simply give notice to Congress and have them removed from their positions 30 days later.",
      "Inspectors general are responsible for rooting out waste and fraud in federal agencies. They are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Reyes said the inspectors general had provided \u201cexceptional service as IGs, marked by decades of distinguished leadership across multiple administrations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey deserved better from their government. They still do,\u201d she wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, this Court cannot provide Plaintiffs more.\u201d",
      "Reyes said the plaintiffs can be legally compensated later if they win their lawsuit, but in the meantime, their removals would stand.",
      "The plaintiffs were inspectors general at the Small Business Administration and the departments of Defense, State, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Education and Labor. Their attorneys say work by inspectors general in 2023 alone saved more than $90 billion in taxpayer dollars.",

The 1,600-mile (2,560 kilometer) route once served as a lifeline between Mexico City and Santa Fe and is depicted as a central feature that snakes through the map.

      "Federal investigators say it's not surprising that the map turned up in Santa Fe, given that the city is a major hub for dealers and collectors who are fascinated with Native American and Spanish colonial art. While they didn't divulge any details about their investigation, they say no charges will be filed.",
      "Manuel Garc\u00eda y Griego, a history professor at the University of New Mexico, recalled photographing a computer image of the map about a decade ago while conducting research at the Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n in Mexico City.

      "During the event, S\u00e1nchez shared several old maps that included areas far beyond the borders of present-day New Mexico, saying there's more to the state's history than the recovered map shows. Still, he said the map being returned to Mexico \"is something quite, quite unique and it shows a different type of settlement pattern.\u201d",
      "Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber crouched down for a better look at the map. While appreciating the fine details, he said everyone in his city is a history buff. After all, Santa Fe \u2014 founded in 1610 as the seat of Spain\u2019s Nuevo Mexico \u2014 is the oldest capital in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe live history. It's not something in the past. It's part of our daily lives,\u201d Webber said, adding that the map helps to illustrate what he described as a very old story built upon many generations and many families.",
      "For Webber, the map also documents a sense of place that is overwhelming and still present today.",
      "\u201cThere are lots of places that are suffering from sameness and Santa Fe and New Mexico are not places that suffer from sameness,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are unique and special and this map bears testimony to it already having been a remarkable place.\u201d",

      "A new federal lawsuit claims an Ohio police officer accused of shooting to death a pregnant Black mother two years ago wasn't trained or supervised properly",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- An Ohio police officer accused of shooting to death a pregnant Black mother two years ago was not trained or supervised properly, according to a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday against the police chief and the township that employed him.",
      "The estate of Ta\u2019Kiya Young sued Blendon Township and its police chief over her August 2023 fatal shooting in the parking lot of a grocery store in the Columbus suburbs. She had been suspected of shoplifting bottles of alcohol when Officer Connor M. Grubb and another officer approached her car. Young, 21, partially lowered her window and the other officer ordered her to get out of the vehicle.",
      "When she moved her car to the right, it rolled toward Grubb, who is accused of shooting her through the windshield. Young and the unborn daughter she was expecting as her third child were both pronounced dead at a hospital. Grubb was charged with murder, involuntary manslaughter and assault last year.",
      "Grubb has pleaded not guilty, and a hearing in his criminal case is scheduled for next week.",
      "\u201cWithout reasonable verification or investigation, the officers recklessly escalated their response, singling out Ms. Young and treating her as a dangerous criminal despite the minor nature of the allegations,\" the lawsuit claims. Grubb has had other \u201caggressive encounters with community members\u201d but faced no meaningful discipline, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit makes a single claim of municipal liability and seeks damages along with an injunction to stop policies that deprived Young and her unborn child of their constitutional rights.",

      "President Donald Trump has created a task force to fight crime in Memphis",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- When President Donald Trump created a task force to fight crime in Memphis, his order included the deployment of the National Guard and various federal agencies to, among other goals, enforce federal immigration law in the Tennessee city.",
      "One of the departments included in the Memphis Safe Task Force is Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That has some Latinos worried that the surge will be used to target them at homes, schools and where they work as part of Trump's plan for mass detentions and deportations of immigrants around the country.",
      "Sandra Pita, a mother of six who is a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, said she and other Hispanic people in Memphis fear that their friends and relatives, even those who are legally in the U.S., could be caught up in the crackdown.",
      "\u201cMy concern as a Latina is they will be targeting people with brown skin color, Black skin color, even my children who are citizens, and the children of other mothers who are born here in Memphis,\u201d said Pita, who was born in California.",
      "Opponents of the deployment call it an unnecessary move and a federal occupation of a city that instead needs more funding to address poverty and other drivers of crime. Supporters say it's a welcomed infusion of law enforcement personnel that, despite recent improvements in crime statistics, still needs help battling violent acts such as carjackings and murders.",
      "\u201cThis is no occupation. It's an investment,\u201d Tennessee state Sen. Brent Taylor, a Republican who supports the deployment, said during a recent GOP rally.",
      "Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee has said publicly he would not expect more than 150 National Guard members to be sent to Memphis. Lee has not officially signed an executive order to deploy members yet. An unknown number of officers from other agencies, from federal immigration authorities to drug enforcement agents, would also be involved.",
      "Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, has said he didn\u2019t ask for the deployment and doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s the way to reduce crime. In his weekly newsletter released Friday, he said he spoke with officials in Washington who said the National Guard in that city served as \u201ceyes and ears on the streets, more like a large-scale neighborhood watch than frontline police officers\" who worked to beautify the city and address homelessness, which he said would help Memphis as well.",
      "Still, data from the federal operation in Washington shows that more than 40% of the arrests made over the monthlong operation were related to immigration, an Associated Press analysis found.",
      "It's unclear when National Guard troops will arrive, though officials have said it could happen within a week.",
      "The governor\u2019s consent to the National Guard stands in sharp contrast to Democratic leaders in states like California and Illinois, who argue similar deployments undermine local authority and inflame tensions. The president has also suggested he could send soldiers to New Orleans, another majority-Black city led by Democrats in a Republican-leaning state.",
      "Roughly 10% of Memphis' population is Hispanic, according to Census data. Since Trump took office in January, community groups have been educating Memphis' Latinos about their rights and what to do if they are approached by agents questioning their immigration status.",

      "\"I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday,\" Kimmel said. \"I did not agree with that decision, and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company \u2026 they welcomed me back on the air.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!\"",
      "He went on, \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,\" Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, which the network settled in December by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million toward Mr. Trump's legal fees.",
      "\"This one sounds even more lucrative,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"A true bunch of losers!\"",
      "Kimmel told his audience Tuesday that the president \"made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.\"",
      "\"One thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like, is anti-American,\" he added.",
      "In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" Carr told Johnson. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "ABC later said that it was \"indefinitely\" suspending the show.",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to preempt Kimmel's show.",
      "Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",
      "Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"monitor the show as it returns to ABC.\"",
      "Regarding Carr, Kimmel on Tuesday\u00a0showed\u00a0the audience a social media post that the FCC chair wrote in May 2022 in which he said, \"Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people in to the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.\"",
      "Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" calling his comments \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities \u2014 including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep \u2014 signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"",
      "Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform \"for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also speculated last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" the president told reporters on Sept. 18. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'\" Cruz said Friday on his podcast. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"",
      "Kimmel's show, which launched in 2003, tapes in front of a studio audience on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The guests for Tuesday's show included actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan.",

    "story": [
      "A former stylist for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 who testified against the disgraced music mogul in his federal criminal trial earlier this year \u2014 filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing Combs of sexual abuse and violence while he was in Combs' employ.",
      "The 37-page lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of Deonte Nash against Combs and Combs' label, Bad Boy Entertainment, also accuses Combs of sexual battery, human trafficking and false imprisonment.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Nash said he was hired to be Combs' stylist around 2008, at the age of 21, and worked for him until about 2018. Nash said that during that time period, he also worked as a stylist and creative director for Combs' then-girlfriend, R&B singer Cassandra Ventura, who also accused Combs of sexual abuse in a 2023 lawsuit and gave graphic testimony against him in his trial.",
      "\"Nash personally experienced sexual, physical, mental, and emotional abuse at the hands of Defendants during his ten-year employment,\" including \"forced tests of loyalty and manipulation, sexual harassment and sexual assaults, physical violence and manhandling, labor trafficking, threats of harm, and threats of death,\" the lawsuit against Combs reads.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Nash was sexually assaulted by Combs on \"multiple occasions.\"",
      "Nash said the alleged abuse prompted him to resign in 2018, but Combs \"continued to threaten Mr. Nash after his employment ended.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Combs' attorneys for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In one incident that Nash claims occurred in 2013 or 2014, Combs discovered that Nash and Ventura had gone out to dinner in L.A. without Combs' permission. The following day, the lawsuit states, Combs \"threw\" Nash \"onto the car and violently strangled him.\"",
      "On another occasion in 2014, Combs and his security team allegedly entered Nash's home without permission, during which they \"confiscated Mr. Nash's keys and phone while they forcibly searched the house\" for Ventura, the lawsuit says.",
      "\"After enduring years of abuse, I finally found the courage during the criminal trial, and I am now ready to take action,\" Nash said in a statement. \"Sean Combs has never taken accountability for the years of harm he inflicted on me and so many others.\"",
      "In July, following a lengthy trial, the 55-year-old Combs was found guilty of two counts of prostitution-related charges, but acquitted on more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "He is\u00a0scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 3.",
      "During the trial, Ventura testified that she was repeatedly physically and sexually abused by Combs over the course of their relationship. She testified about a 2016 incident, which was caught on\u00a0surveillance video, that showed Combs violently assaulting her in the hallway of a California hotel.",
      "Nash also testified in the trial that Combs threatened Ventura and that he \"would beat her.\"",
      "Nash testified about a time when Combs allegedly grabbed a sleeping Ventura by the hair and started hitting her \"pretty hard.\" Nash said Ventura's head hit a bed frame and started bleeding, and Combs then told her, Nash and an assistant, \"Look what y'all made me do.\"",
      "Nash testified he dialed 911 but was told to hang up. He said he feared retaliation but did tell some of Combs' employees about the alleged abuse and told jurors Combs got physical with him a few times.",
      "During the trial,\u00a0Combs' attorneys denied the sexual abuse allegations brought by Ventura against their client, and argued that while evidence showed Combs may have lived a party lifestyle, they claimed he did not engage in racketeering conspiracy or sex trafficking.",
      "Nash's lawsuit seeks both compensatory and punitive damages and demands a jury trial.",

      "Natalie Jackson, another of the family's attorneys, said they believe Zavala suffered repeated head strikes based on what witnesses have said. \"His disability did not kill him,\" Jackson said. \"It was the blunt force trauma.\"",
      "The medical examiner for the Orlando area ruled the cause of death as multiple blunt impact injuries and said the manner of death was an accident.",

Well, just because it didn't malfunction does not lead us to believe that there were not safety issues because we know something caused him to die,\" said famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump, whose law firm is representing the family.",

A judge stopped the sale after Riley Keough, Lisa Marie's daughter, sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "Graceland opened as a museum and tourist attraction in 1982 and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. A large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street from the museum is owned by Elvis Presley Enterprises. Presley died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Members of the Presley family, including Elvis, Lisa Marie and Benjamin Keough are buried on the property.",
      "The public notice for the foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother's death.",
      "After the scheme fell apart, Findley tried to make it look like the person responsible was a Nigerian identity thief, prosecutors said. An email sent May 25, 2024, to the AP from the same email as the earlier statement said in Spanish that the foreclosure sale attempt was made by a Nigerian fraud ring that targets old and dead people in the U.S. and uses the internet to steal money.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs urged a New York federal judge Monday to sentence him early next month to no more than 14 months in prison for his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, meaning he'd go free almost immediately if the judge agreed.",
      "The lawyers made their arguments in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who has already rejected a proposed $50 million bail package, signaling that he doesn't believe the Grammy-winning artist is close to being released.",
      "\"Mr. Combs's celebrity status in the realms of music, fashion, spirits, media, and finance has been shattered and Mr. Combs's legacy has been destroyed,\" the lawyers wrote, saying their client has been punished enough.",
      "The submission provided new information about what life behind bars for nearly 13 months has been like for Combs, what's happened to his businesses and other interests and explains why he turned down a plea-deal offer from prosecutors prior to his trial.",
      "Combs will learn his sentencing fate on Oct. 3",
      "Combs faces an Oct. 3 sentencing after his July conviction by a Manhattan jury on two Mann Act charges that outlaw interstate commerce related to prostitution. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The Bad Boy Records founder was exonerated on more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that would have required a minimum of 15 years in prison and the possibility of a life sentence.",
      "In their submission, Combs' lawyers argued that a jury sent a loud message to the judge by exonerating him of the most serious charges.",
      "\"Put simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an 'affirmative indication of innocence,'\" the lawyers said.",
      "\"He has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America - yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life,\" they added.",
      "Prosecutors, who will submit their recommendations prior to the Oct. 3 sentencing, have already said they'll urge Combs stay imprisoned substantially longer than the four to five years they originally thought.",
      "Defense lawyers, though, wrote in their submission Monday that prosecutors \"have lost all perspective.\"",
      "Combs's career and reputation are ruined, lawyers say",
      "\"Mr. Combs's career and reputation have been destroyed,\" they wrote. \"His life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled.\"",
      "Among other things, they noted that he had to let go over 100 employees from his businesses and many of them have been unable to get new jobs because of their past association with Combs.",
      "His seven children, they said, have faced \"devastating consequences,\" including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.",
      "The lawyers also noted that Combs and his family were set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public.",
      "Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.",
      "Inmate approached Combs with a shiv, lawyers say",
      "Meanwhile, Combs's life in prison has been harrowing at times, even as it has allowed him to become sober for the first time in 25 years, his lawyers said.",
      "On one occasion, another inmate approached Combs with a shiv, accusing Combs of sitting on a chair that the inmate wanted to sit on, before Combs defused the situation and calmed the man and his makeshift weapon down, the lawyers said.",
      "They said he has been under constant suicide watch, meaning every two hours he must present his identification card to guards to show he is alive and well and is awakened from sleep in a brightly lighted cell by a guard to ensure he is well.",
      "He also has limited access to clean water, leaving him to heat the water that he drinks to ensure it won't make him sick and he must sleep within two feet of other inmates in a dorm-style room containing a bathroom and no door, the lawyers wrote.",
      "\"Mr. Combs has not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months, or felt sunlight on his skin, often walking with a limp due to a painful knee injury that requires surgery,\" they said. And the food, they added, sometimes contains maggots.",
      "Lawyers say Combs had no choice to face trial after plea offer",
      "Prior to trial, the lawyers said, prosecutors offered Combs a plea deal that would have recommended a prison sentence of at least 25 years and required him to plead guilty to crimes of which he was acquitted.",
      "They portrayed their client as a changed man, who had realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "\"Without minimizing Mr. Combs's conduct, this is in many ways a 'sex, drugs, and rock n' roll' story,\" they said. \"Mr. Combs had severe substance abuse problems throughout the entirety of the offense conduct and participated in a high-octane celebrity lifestyle.\"",
      "The music maven's trial featured lengthy testimony from two former girlfriends of Combs who said they felt forced to participate in drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed the dayslong encounters.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura testified that she participated in hundreds of the meetups that were referred to as \"freak-offs\" while she was his most frequent girlfriend from 2007 to 2018.",
      "Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said she also felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers while she dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest at a New York hotel a year ago.",
      "Lawyers say a sober Combs looks to new future unlike his past",
      "There was also extensive testimony during the trial about Combs beating his girlfriends and using violence and the fears of it to control those around him.",
      "Defense lawyers at trial conceded there was domestic abuse but said the charges brought by prosecutors were not proven.",
      "While he was once so depressed in jail that \"there were days when he was unable to get out of his bed or even talk to the psychology department,\" his lawyers said he looks forward to the future.",
      "They said he has begun teaching other inmates essential skills in business management, entrepreneurship and personal development.",
      "The lawyers wrote that the education program has become \"one of the most impactful and important endeavors of his life\" and he hopes to expand it to state-run facilities once he is released.",
      "\"He is a humbled man who understands that the most important things in life are his devotion to and quality time with his family and his contributions for the benefit of others,\" they said.",
      "Possibility of a pardon",
      "Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, told CBS News in July that he has not had any conversations with the Trump administration about seeking a pardon for his client after another attorney for Combs, Nicole Westmoreland, told\u00a0CNN\u00a0it was her understanding that the defense team \"had conversations in reference to a pardon.\"",
      "But Agnifilo told CBS News, \"I have nothing to do with a possible pardon.\"",
      "\"I have had conversations with nobody,\" Agnifilo said. \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "He says he hasn't discussed it with Combs either, except to tell him what's in the news.",
      "\"He says, 'Go tell him (Mr. Trump) that I need a pardon,'\" Agnofilo said. \"'Go tell him I deserve a pardon.' That's what he said.\"",

    "story": [
      "After being pulled off the air nearly a week ago, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" will return on Tuesday, The Walt Disney Company announced Monday.",
      "The late-night show had been \"pre-empted indefinitely\" last week following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to\u00a0the shooting death\u00a0of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "In a statement Monday, The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, said Kimmel's show was suspended \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" adding that some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "Kimmel had not yet commented on Monday on his show's return.",
      "The late-night host made the remarks in his monologue on Sept. 15, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" He also mocked Mr. Trump's reaction to the shooting.",
      "Before Disney announced last week that Kimmel's show was \"pre-empted indefinitely,\" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr called the remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" he said during a podcast interview, telling host Benny Johnson: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Kimmel faced criticism from conservatives over his comments. Mr. Trump last week had congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "ABC parent company Disney has faced fallout in Hollywood over the move: Other late-night hosts have publicly sided with Kimmel, A-listers like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro signed an open letter calling it a \"dark moment for freedom of speech,\" and screenwriter and \"Lost\" co-creator Damon Lindelof vowed not to work with Disney unless Kimmel's show is restored. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who led Disney for more than two decades, spoke out and defended Kimmel last week, writing on X: \"Where has all the leadership gone? If not for university presidents, law firm managing partners, and corporate chief executives standing up against bullies, who then will step up for the first amendment?\"",
      "Carr's comments on Kimmel drew pushback on First Amendment grounds, with the FCC's sole Democrat-appointed commissioner, Anna Gomez, arguing the agency had used Kimmel's \"inopportune joke as a pretext to punish speech it disliked.\" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also sharply criticized Carr for urging ABC to crack down on Kimmel, calling the Trump appointee's comments \"dangerous as hell\" and \"right out of 'Goodfellas.'\" Cruz chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.",
      "ABC's announcement last week came after media giant Nexstar announced that it would preempt Kimmel's show indefinitely on all its stations over Kimmel's remarks. Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said the comments were \"offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located.\"",
      "Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "\"Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform,\" Sinclair said last week in a statement.",
      "On Monday night, Sinclair posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",

      "Johnson endured three hours of makeup and prosthetics a day to look like Kerr, and he's never played anyone quite so real before. But it's something he says he's been aching to do.",
      "\"For years, I've been dreaming and hoping,\" he said. \"My desire was to play not only a dramatic role, but something that I felt like I could really sink my teeth into, and rip myself open.

      "For \"The Smashing Machine,\" he had to find a way to transform into someone whose whole world was coming apart, like the scene where Mark Kerr loses his first fight. To conjure up the feelings of despair on camera, Johnson knew right where to go. \"I went back to what it's like being a 15-year-old kid and coming home and being evicted,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"You said it felt like you were ripping yourself open. What do you think that did for you, Dwayne Johnson, ripping yourself open like that?\"",
      "\"The thing that I was running from, which was ripping myself open, is actually the thing that I needed the most,\" he replied, \"because it made me realize that the thing I love, which is acting and telling these stories, now I see it in a different world.\"",

At first, I thought it was an odd reaction, and I worried about what the paparazzi would make of Lisa playing in the wake of her father's death. But then I realized it was a child's way of escaping the reality of the silent house. I hugged her close, then went inside.",
      "I still didn't know what had happened, so Joe told me. Ginger had found Elvis unconscious, face down on the floor of the bathroom, that afternoon. She called downstairs for help, and Joe had raced upstairs. He knew immediately that Elvis had passed, but he didn't want to believe it. My heart plummeted as Joe confirmed that Lisa had seen Elvis's body. Elvis was still face down on the floor when she saw him, his face buried in the shag carpet. Lisa had been afraid he was suffocating. Joe wasn't sure if she'd understood what she was seeing. He'd sent her to see Grandma while the ambulance came. He did chest compressions while they waited for the ambulance. A doctor continued efforts to resuscitate Elvis as they raced to the hospital, but all the efforts were futile. Shortly after arrival, Elvis was pronounced dead. Apparently, it was a heart attack.",
      "Inside Graceland, the atmosphere was eerie. The house seemed hollow and dead. It was as if the energy had been sucked out of it\u2014Elvis's life force. We all walked around like zombies. Vernon was distraught. He felt Elvis's passing very, very deeply. It broke my heart to see such a strong man repeatedly call out his son's name, tears streaming down his face. He was losing his only child. A part of Vernon was lost that day as well. I never again saw the energy he once had. When- ever he'd come into a room and said, \"Hey, son,\" his face would light up with a smile. I never saw that smile again. Grandma struggled to believe that Elvis was gone. After he left us, she always carried a little handkerchief. I'd see her tearing up, and she'd wipe her eyes and whisper, \"My boy.\"",
      "There was no privacy for those of us closest to Elvis, including the family. People and cameras surrounded the property. Mourners waited to be admitted to the house for a public viewing of Elvis's open casket. The funeral was a nationally televised event. The streets near Graceland were thronged with tens of thousands of people. The crowds were so large by the second day that President Jimmy Carter called up the Air National Guard to help local police. It was hot and muggy, and some in the crowd fainted from the heat and from emotion. In the afternoon, thousands of people filed past the open casket that had been set up in the front hall. Lisa stayed with Elvis's body as much as she could. She didn't want to leave him. We sat on the stairs and watched as people walked by. Crowds of strangers in Elvis's home, crying and paying their respects. Some mourners had walked away from their jobs to drive sixteen hours or more to Memphis and line up along Elvis Presley Boulevard, hoping to be admitted to the house. The trip was a financial sacrifice for many of them, for much of the crowd was made up of the everyday people who identified with Elvis as one of their own. He, too, had come from poverty. He had remained loyal to his hometown and his family, and he never got above his upbringing. They felt compelled to pay their respects as they would to a family member. It was overwhelming. There wasn't room yet for our own grief.",
      "His memorial was an international event. While mourners gathered in Memphis, Christ's Church in London held a service in Elvis's honor. Over five hundred people crowded the sanctuary and the lawn outside. At the close of the service, they all sang \"Amazing Grace\" in his honor. Elvis's passing was felt not just in Memphis, but around the world.",
      "The private funeral service was held in the living room and adjoining music room, with the peacock glass framing an archway between the two. Elvis's coffin was moved into the room for the service. Vernon had hired a local preacher who didn't know Elvis and who talked primarily about Elvis's legendary generosity. The Blackwood Brothers, longtime friends and backup singers for Elvis, sang gospel songs. I sat on the couch with Lisa and Vernon, numb with grief. It was all a blur at the time, and it still is.",
      "Lisa and I waited until we could be alone with Elvis to say goodbye. I had bought a silver bracelet engraved with the words, \"I love you, Daddy,\" for Lisa to give him. I helped her put it around his wrist. Then we each kissed him one last time. I'm not sure it hit me until then that he was really gone. The body I had held and caressed so many times was now stiff and empty. It was an eerie, aching feeling.",
      "A line of white Cadillacs formed the funeral procession to the Forest Hill Cemetery. Lisa and I rode with Vernon in the car immediately following the hearse. Elvis was entombed in the Presley family crypt with his mother. Two days later, after two thieves tried to steal the coffin, he was moved to the Meditation Garden at Graceland and kept under security. Gladys was moved to Graceland shortly afterward, to lie beside him. Elvis and I used to sit in that garden in the small hours of the morning, in the peace and the moonlight. I was glad they had brought him home.",
      "Vernon had a bronze plaque made to cover the coffin, with an inscription ending, \"We miss you, Son and Daddy.\"",
      "I returned home to LA with Lisa, feeling that a large part of me had died with Elvis. I couldn't accept that he had passed. I'd felt Elvis would always be there. He was such a force of nature. Despite all my fears for him, I never thought he would die at the age he did. He was still so young. He'd talked so much about what he still wanted to do. He had plans for his music and for his life. Elvis wasn't ready to leave. I wasn't ready.",
      "It was a constant battle to accept that he was gone. Every morning, I would wake up and remember, \"Oh God, Elvis isn't here anymore. How can I live knowing that?\" I was frightened to be in a world without Elvis in it.",
      "There would be no more calls. I would never again pick up the phone and hear his voice. There would be no more visits, no more dropping by unexpectedly. I wouldn't be going to Graceland anymore, except to visit Grandma and Vernon. There was no more Memphis Mafia. Everybody scattered. Everything changed. I changed. I had been happy-go-lucky, always excited about where we were going or what we were doing next. I had finally adjusted to the separation, feeling free and adventurous. Optimistic. My memories of Elvis had been happy ones. When I went somewhere we'd been, I would think, \"Oh my gosh, we went here.\" I remembered the times fans would cling to him and want pictures. They loved him and didn't want to let him go, and when he tried to escape, a trail of girls would follow him. It had been fun. He had so much charm and was so generous to loved ones and strangers alike. It filled him with joy when he was able to do something special for other people.",
      "Now my mind was filled with images of loss. I couldn't get away from reminders of him. The media was filled with articles and broadcasts about Elvis, and his songs flooded the radio stations. If I went out, people would come over and say, \"I'm so sorry.\" I knew they meant well, but it was painful. For a long time after Elvis passed, I rarely went anywhere. I waited a while to continue with my life.",
      "Worst of all, I no longer had a father for my daughter. I was raising my child by myself, a brokenhearted child who had lost her daddy. When we got back home from the funeral, we were surrounded by reminders of his passing. I had to protect her from all the news reports, the unwanted attention, the nonstop condolence calls. It seemed like every newspaper and magazine had a headline about his passing. If Lisa and I went to the grocery store, I'd pull the ones with headlines out of the rack and turn them around in the checkout line so Lisa wouldn't see them. To get her away from the constant reminders, I decided to send her to summer camp. I hoped it would not only insulate her from the publicity but also take her mind off her thoughts. Joanie's kids and some of her other friends were there. I checked on her regularly at camp, and she seemed to be doing pretty well. She later said that camp had helped. When it ended for the summer, my sister and I took her out of the country to give her some privacy until the incessant publicity died down. We went to England and later to Europe. We were seldom recognized there, and we could explore the sights in peace.",

    "summary": "In her new book, Priscilla Presley writes what she calls her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after.",
    "story": [
      "It was a truly Vegas affair at the Aladdin Hotel; Elvis in a paisley tux, Priscilla with a rhinestone tiara. By the time they'd met, when Priscilla Beaulieu was just 14, Elvis Presley had already gyrated his way into pop culture, from his music to his movies.",
      "He redefined what celebrity was, and yet, Hollywood was no place for him. \"He would always go back to Memphis; that's where home was,\" said Priscilla.",
      "Priscilla met Elvis while he was in the Army stationed in Germany. The only thing that made more news than their relationship was their divorce in 1973. \"I mean, I was very much in love with Elvis, very much,\" said Priscilla, now 80. \"I am still very much in love with him. I didn't leave him because I didn't love him; I just couldn't live the life.\"",
      "Her split from Elvis is where she begins \"Softly, as I Leave You\" (to be published Tuesday), what she says is her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after. \"I was living Elvis' life,\" she said. \"It was all about him. I had to find me. Who was I? I was Elvis' wife. I don't think we could ever have a life that I wanted. I wanted him for myself.\"",
      "But so did his fans. Elvis, it seemed was destined to be shared. \"I thought, well, what if he runs into someone he falls in love with?\" said Priscilla. \"And I mentioned it to him, and he goes, 'You don't have to worry. You never have to worry.' But when you see these beautiful girls hanging out, I'm going,\u00a0Could that be the one?",
      "\"I couldn't live a life of being in panic all the time, of losing him to someone else,\" she said.",
      "There were affairs on both sides, and yet after their divorce, they still couldn't quit each other. They stayed uncommonly close. Neither ever remarried. \"We couldn't find anyone else!\" she laughed.",
      "She started businesses, and began taking acting classes. She says it helped with her shyness, and grew her confidence. She was also busy raising her and Elvis' only daughter, Lisa Marie. They had joint custody for nearly four years \u2026 before it all ended.",
      "At age 42, Elvis was gone.",
      "Priscilla had seen the changes \u2013 the bloating, the slurred words, the drugs.",
      "I asked, \"Was there anybody around him who could convince him to stop?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"You couldn't convince Elvis on anything unless he believed in it or, you know, thought about it.\"",
      "She said doctors would basically give him anything he wanted, enabling him. \"He was Elvis; you're not going to say no to Elvis,\" she said.",
      "In his absence sat Graceland, the Memphis mansion that had been hemorrhaging money. The urge was to sell. Priscilla said, \"And I looked at the guy who was telling me, the attorney, and I said, 'That will never happen, ever.'\"",
      "Instead, she opened it to the public. It went from a home to a family shrine.",
      "By the time Lisa Marie turned 25, Elvis' inheritance was hers. It was 1993, the same year another King popped the question \u2026 the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.",
      "Priscilla recalled, \"We were walking on the beach, and she said, 'Mom, you know, Michael wants to get married.' I said, 'Lisa, I'm not really for it.' And she goes, 'Why not.' And I go, 'Who are you? Michael Jackson, Lisa Presley?' And I knew that Michael loved attention, which he did. I knew that's the reason why. They didn't even know each other that long.\"",
      "Priscilla was no fan of another celebrity, O.J. Simpson. She worked with him on the \"Naked Gun\" series. \"He could be very, very nice, but I just didn't, I just felt something about him in the way he was with his wife, and it didn't set well with me,\" she said.",
      "That said, Priscilla was a huge fan of co-star Leslie Nielsen.",
      "Before \"Naked Gun,\" Priscilla had never done comedy. She was thought of in most circles as a more serious actor after her role in \"Dallas\" a few years before.",
      "\"Dallas\" was a spotlight the size of Texas, and Priscilla's role as Jenna Wade put her in the pop zeitgeist all over again.",
      "She left the series after having her second child, Navarone, with her longtime partner Marco Garibaldi.",
      "In 2023, her last physical link with Elvis left. Lisa Marie Presley died suddenly at her home in California from complications after bariatric surgery, and once again the Presley name was draped in grief.",
      "\"I miss her every day,\" Priscilla said. \"I miss her, but I have to let that go and live my life. But her spirit is still with me very, very much.\"",
      "She's buried at Graceland, like her dad. Priscilla says she will be there one day, too. For her, the first home she had as a married woman will be her last.\u00a0 That's not looking backward, she says; it's a comfort for the future.",
      "\"When you stop and think about it, we're not here that long. We're not,\" Priscilla said. \"All of a sudden we're older and we think, Wow, I don't want to hold on to bad things. I don't want to hold on to, you know, things that are in the past that happened. I want to move forward.\"",

      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol on Thursday said the company is planning on closing underperforming locations, including those where the coffee chain is \"unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect,\" and will cut 900 jobs.",
      "The overhaul will cost $1 billion, according to a Thursday regulatory filing. Most of the costs are related to the store closures, such as $450 million in costs for breaking leases early. About $150 million will cover expenses for cutting the 900 employees, who Niccol said are \"nonretail\" workers.",
      "Niccol disclosed the plan in a letter to employees, but didn't specify how many locations would be shuttered. He did note that after adding some new locations over the last year, the company's overall store count in North America will decline by about 1% in fiscal year 2025.",
      "The company will end its current fiscal year with about 18,300 locations, he added. In its 2024 fiscal year, the company had 18,424 coffee shops.",
      "The overhaul comes as part of Niccol's \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, a strategy designed to revitalize its coffee shops and convince consumers to return to the stores. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales have slowed amid heightened competition from rivals such as Dunkin'.",
      "\"[W]e identified coffeehouses where we're unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don't see a path to financial performance, and these locations will be closed,\" Niccol wrote in the letter.",
      "\"Each year, we open and close coffeehouses for a variety of reasons, from financial performance to lease expirations. This is a more significant action that we understand will impact partners and customers,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Retailers are expected to hire fewer seasonal workers this year as tariffs and inflationary pressures roil the economy.",
    "story": [
      "Retailers around the U.S. are expected to sharply reduce the number of workers they add for the holidays, a shift from their usual seasonal hiring sprees to help cope with the annual crush of customers.",
      "Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas attributes the weak demand for extra workers this year to companies bearing the heavier costs from U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, as well as on rising inflation and their growing reliance on technology to improve efficiency.",
      "The firm expects retail hiring fo the holidays to fall to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was emerging from a recession caused by the global financial crisis.",
      "\"Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,\" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The weaker seasonal hiring forecast comes as the U.S. job market is faltering. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of economists' expectations.",
      "Inflation has also edged up in recent months. The Consumer Price Index, which in March had sunk to an annual rate of 2.3%, in August\u00a0rose at a 2.9%\u00a0pace from a year ago.",
      "In the last quarter of 2024, retailers added just over 543,000 seasonal workers, down roughly 4% compared to 2023. Companies are projected to add fewer than 500,000 jobs during the last three months of 2025, according to Challenger. Such a figure would mark the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years.",
      "Challenger pointed to fewer seasonal hiring announcements than usual from retailers as a sign they plan to hire fewer workers for the holidays.",
      "\"While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less,\" Challenger said.",
      "Tariffs are causing some consumers to pull back on spending, recent data shows. An August survey\u00a0of consumers from the University of Michigan found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that see tariff-driven price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that rise substantially in price, according to the report.",
      "Tariffs have already driven up the cost of some categories of goods for U.S. consumers. For example, in August, audio equipment rose in price by 12% compared to one year earlier,\u00a0 while the cost of household goods rose 10%, the latest Consumer Price Index report\u00a0shows.",
      "\"A wave of uncertainty is impacting not just retailers, but also consumers heading into the final quarter of the year. With hiring slowing across the board, Retailers may hire fewer workers themselves, while many of their shoppers slow spending,\" Challenger added.",

      "Lawyers representing the family of a 32-year-old man who died after riding on a Universal Orlando Resort roller coaster said he likely died as a result of an injury incurred during the ride and that his disability played no role in his death.",
      "Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, who had a spinal disability and used a wheelchair, became unresponsive while on the coaster last week at the recently opened Epic Universe theme park in Florida. He was transported to a local hospital and later died.",
      "Attorneys for Zavala's family said Monday they believe he hit his head on a restraint during the coaster's downward thrusts and that he was unconscious for most of the ride. He had no medical issues before boarding the ride, they said.",
      "Natalie Jackson, another of the family's attorneys, said they believe Zavala suffered repeated head strikes based on what witnesses have said. \"His disability did not kill him,\" Jackson said. \"It was the blunt force trauma.\"",
      "The medical examiner for the Orlando area ruled the cause of death as multiple blunt impact injuries and said the manner of death was an accident.",

Well, just because it didn't malfunction does not lead us to believe that there were not safety issues because we know something caused him to die,\" said famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump, whose law firm is representing the family.",
      "Karen Irwin, Universal Orlando Resort's president, said in her note that the internal findings showed ride systems functioned normally, equipment was intact and Universal workers followed the proper procedures.

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday is expected to sign\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S., according to a White House official.",
      "On Monday, a senior White House official said Mr. Trump would declare that the deal is a \"qualified divestiture\" and satisfies a law passed by Congress that requires TikTok's parent company to divest or face a ban. The declaration is expected to come in Mr. Trump's fifth executive order pushing back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in TikTok, according to the official. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "But there's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some could see the deal as not going far enough as it relates to TikTok's algorithm.",
      "As details on the deal trickled out from the administration last week, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China Committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Congress set clear legal safeguards for a deal, including precluding any cooperation with ByteDance or its affiliates on TikTok's recommendation algorithm, and prohibiting any ongoing operational relationship between a new TikTok and ByteDance,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"Based on initial reports, I am concerned the reported licensing deal may involve ongoing reliance by the new TikTok on a ByteDance algorithm and application that could allow continued CCP control or influence.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",

      "A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands \u2014 including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports \u2014 out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, during which time it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be used for that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/h-1b-visa-new-fee-immigration-impact-american-workers/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:23:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The large fee could help some U.S. workers find jobs, but there could be longer-term costs, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says the new $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will spur companies to hire Americans instead of bringing in labor from overseas. Yet many economists predict the results will be more mixed, potentially fostering increased domestic hiring in some industries but slowing long-term economic growth with a knock-on effect on overall employment.",
      "\"I could envision a scenario in which otherwise available [American] employees see a large increase for their labor demand,\" Kirk Doran, associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said of the new visa policy. \"There is some evidence that for the kind of work H-1B employees do, there are available workers looking for jobs right now.\"",
      "In the near term, some technology industry workers in particular could see job gains as more companies seek to avoid the sharply higher costs of bringing in employees from overseas, Rutgers University labor economist Jennifer Hunt told CBS News.",
      "\"The winners would be U.S. native-born computer programmers,\" she said. \"If you're a native worker who is really similar to an immigrant, immigrants are usually bad for you. So we would expect current American, U.S. programmers to be helped.\"",
      "Yet the bigger picture is more complex. Other economic research shows that hiring immigrant workers often benefits companies, providing a ready source of skilled labor with the education and training that may not be widely available in the U.S.",
      "One 2024 study from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment said H-1B workers can \"help firms increase their employment, revenues and survival probabilities,\" while finding no evidence that hiring of foreign labor through the program displaced native-born American workers.",
      "The research \u2014 from economists at IZA, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, University of Delaware, University of Michigan and Queens College, CUNY \u2014 also found that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains. \"High-wage, high-productivity firms expand more and even crowd-in natives with college degrees\" when able to add H-1B workers, they wrote.",
      "George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens underlined that H-1B workers with specialized skills can help boost a company's revenue and profits, potentially spawning other kinds of jobs at the employer, such as in sales and marketing, that can be filled by U.S. workers.",
      "As a result, Clemens worries that the policy change would hurt Americans' job prospects over the long term. \"It is going to choke off job opportunities for the people it is supposed to help,\" he said.",
      "Cost of restricting immigration",
      "To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company. Congress caps the number of H-1B visas \u2014 which are valid for three years and which can be extended for an additional three years \u2014 at 85,000 annually. Roughly 700,000 workers in the U.S. hold H-1B visas, according to Capital Economics.",
      "\"The costs of restricting immigration are widespread,\" Gaurav Khanna, a University of California San Diego professor of economics focusing on migration, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"On net, it benefits U.S. workers more than it hurts them, such that the benefits outweigh the costs. The visas allow the IT companies to grow quite rapidly, and these IT firms start hiring other workers in management positions and in HR, so it leads to employment growth at these firms.\"",
      "The White House dismissed the notion that hiring workers from abroad also benefits U.S. workers.",
      "\"President Trump continues to prove to so-called 'experts' wrong time and time again \u2013 no 'economic study' can change the reality lived by many Americans across the country who bore the brunt of the massive abuse of the H-1B system,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "Rogers added that the visa fee protects \"Americans from cheap, foreign labor.\"",
      "In a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump said H-1B visas disadvantage Americans by allowing companies to exploit the program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" That has stunted job opportunities and undermined wages, he added.",
      "How much do H-1B workers earn?",
      "Some research supports this claim. For example, an August analysis\u00a0from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that H-1B workers earn significantly less than their American counterparts.",
      "\"[M]any employers may be using the H-1B program not to attract top-tier global talent, but to fill roles at below-median wage levels\u2014raising questions about the program's alignment with its stated objectives,\" the report said.",
      "Other changes could be coming to the H-1B program, with the Trump administration aiming to tilt it toward better-paid foreign workers. On Monday, it proposed replacing the lottery with a system that would favor immigrants with advanced skills and higher incomes.",
      "The Heritage report also notes that the visas restrict worker mobility by tying a visa holder to a given company, preventing them from seeking other employment. That can make such workers more desirable to employers than native workers, who can leave their jobs at any time, the report explains.",
      "In this sense, companies' reliance on the program can hurt native workers, the group said.",
      "\"But this creates an uneven playing field: Native workers, who are free to switch jobs or negotiate better pay, may be overlooked not because they lack skills, but because they are not as easily retained or controlled,\" wrote Alexander Frei, the report's author and formerly a senior research associate at Heritage. \"As a result, employers may favor visa-bound workers who accept lower wages and fewer demands, driving down bargaining power and wage growth for equally or more qualified U.S. workers.\"",
      "Other groups have\u00a0criticized the H-1B program for disproportionately benefiting large, multinational firms that can enter thousands of visa applicants in the lottery and hire whomever is successful.",

      "U.S. District Judge Melissa Damian ruled Friday that the consumers who filed the class-action lawsuit failed to show that the lack of confectionary details on the chocolate and peanut butter candies, such as missing mouths and eyes on jack-'o-lanterns, ghosts and other Halloween-themed figures, had cause them economic harm.",
      "Damian pointed out that while the consumers may have been disappointed by the chocolates' unwrapped appearances, the candies were not \"so flawed as to render them worthless.\" In other words, the chocolate still tasted like chocolate, even if they weren't as haunting as the purchasers had expected from the packaging.",
      "The lawsuit focused on several Hershey candies that are marketed around Halloween, including its Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins and its Reese's White Ghost, as well as a few other holiday-themed chocolates like its Reese's Peanut Butter Shapes Assortment Snowmen Stockings Bells.",
      "The original lawsuit, filed in 2024, claimed that Hershey used deceptive advertising because the \"artistic designs\" depicted on the wrappers were absent from the actual candies.",
      "But the difference between the wrappers and the chocolates' actual appearances wasn't enough to prove \"a concrete economic injury,\" Damian wrote on Friday.",
      "\"Plaintiffs' conclusory allegations as to why they have allegedly been deprived of the benefit of their bargain all boil down to their subjective, personal expectations of how the products would or should have looked when unpackaged,\" the judge added.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:14:55 -0400",
    "summary": "The Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" spending and tax law will result in cuts to food stamp benefits for many Americans, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people who receive food stamps could soon see smaller benefits or even get kicked out of the program due to changes that are starting to roll out from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, according to several analyses from the federal government and public policy think tanks.",
      "About 2.4 million people, or about 6% of enrollees, could lose access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), in an average month, because of the new law's changes, which include stricter work requirements, the Congressional Budget Office estimated last month.",
      "Millions more will see their monthly benefit amounts shrink because of other changes mandated by the law, such as a new restrictions on how an individual's benefits are calculated, it added. The total pool of people who will either be cut off from SNAP or see smaller monthly benefits could reach 22.3 million U.S. families, according to a July analysis from the Urban Institute.",
      "About 42 million individuals in 22.3 million households received food stamps in 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on the program.",
      "While SNAP is funded by the USDA, every U.S. state is in charge of administering the program to its residents, with those administrative costs split between the federal and state governments. Some states are already beginning to implement some of the new law's food stamp restrictions, such as Pennsylvania, which is mandating the stricter work rules starting Nov. 1.",
      "The changes are arriving at a precarious time for many, with grocery costs continuing to rise and poverty rates inching higher for senior citizens and Black Americans, according to new Census data. Anti-hunger advocates warn that reduced SNAP benefits could worsen food insecurity, undermining one of the nation's most effective safety nets credited with lifting 3.6 million people out of poverty last year, according to U.S. Census data.",
      "\"We are deeply concerned that the cuts to SNAP will lead to an increase in hunger,\" Carolyn Vega, associate director of policy analysis for Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger nonprofit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are looking at households that don't have a lot of extra wiggle room in their budget, so that makes every SNAP dollar very precious in extending that food budget.\"",
      "Tracking the impact of those SNAP cuts on food insecurity as the changes unfurl over the coming months and years may be difficult, given the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sept. 20 announcement that it is halting its annual Household Food Security Report, which measures whether American families have access to healthy food.",
      "The USDA said it is nixing the report because it is \"redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous\" and leads to \"fear mongering.\" But anti-hunger advocates say scrapping the report could ultimately obscure the impact of the Republicans' cuts to the food stamp program.",
      "\"I don't see how it's redundant \u2014 the USDA puts out the only report on food insecurity,\" Vega said. \"It just indicates to me that they don't want to see the results of the reconciliation bill,\" referring to the Republican's \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about that claim.",
      "New work requirements",
      "New work requirements for SNAP recipients are taking effect as the labor market stalls, raising the risk that more people could lose access to food stamps under the stricter rules mandated by the Republican law, advocates say.",
      "\"It's a tough workforce right now, and the work requirements come without any support,\" Gina Plata-Nino, a food stamp expert at the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our most vulnerable will have even less access to resources.\"",
      "The new work rules expand what the federal government considers so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, who are adults without young children who must prove they are either working, volunteering or engaged in an education or training program for at least 20 hours a week to qualify for food stamps.",
      "Previously, the work requirements only applied to people between 18 to 54 years old, but the new law pushes that to age 64. Additionally, people who are former foster youth between 18 to 24 years old, veterans or homeless are no longer exempt from the work requirements, as they were previously.",
      "People who don't meet the work requirements will be limited to receiving food stamps for three months within a three-year period.",
      "\"Just off the bat, those are veterans, youths aging out of foster care \u2014 think about what it means to be unhoused, trying to get a job when you don't have a place to shower,\" Plata-Nino said. \"Again, these populations are going to be worse off.\"",
      "Work requirements have been championed by Republican lawmakers because they say the rules encourage people to be gainfully employed or engaged in the community in exchange for food aid.",
      "But anti-hunger advocates argue the rules often bump people off the program because they may face difficulties in filing paperwork. Others point out that low-income workers may struggle to get enough hours from their employers to meet the new federal requirements, especially given the proliferation of \"just in time\" scheduling, which slots workers into short shifts to reduce costs for employers.",
      "Prior to the changes, most SNAP recipients who were required to work were doing so, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Stricter aid calculations",
      "Under the new GOP tax and spending law, there are other changes going into the SNAP program that could reduce benefits for millions.",
      "For instance, SNAP applicants can deduct their utility costs from their incomes when calculating their benefits, which can help to increase their food-stamp allotments. But the new law now prevents food-stamp recipients from counting internet expenses as part of their household costs when determining benefits. That change went into effect as soon as the law was signed on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "\"Roughly 65% of participating households will see their benefit drop by an average of $10 a month\" because of the exclusion in using internet costs to calculate benefits, Vega said.",
      "\"It's a relatively small amount but for a household facing rising grocery cost and facing tough decisions, $10 can make a difference,\" she added.",
      "Longer-term, there are additional changes that could strain states' ability to provide food stamps, such as a shift in fiscal year 2027 requiring that states cover 75% of administrative costs, up from 50% now. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, states with high error rates \u2014 such as over- and underpayments of SNAP benefits \u2014 will also need to provide more funding for the program, starting in 2028.",
      "One concern, according to Vega, is whether states will have the financial resources to cover those additional costs.",
      "\"It's uncharted territory,\" she said. \"We do worry some states might decide they can't take that level of liability and won't participate in SNAP.\"",

      "The findings jibe with data from Cars Commerce \u2014 whose holdings include\u00a0Cars.com\u00a0\u2014 that shows\u00a0 a 33% surge in EV demand since last year as shoppers rush to take advantage of the credits. The automotive tech company also found that used EVs are on dealers' lots for 46 days on average, a nearly 30% decrease from last last year that indicates the sector of the EV market is rising in popularity.",
      "Deals to be had",
      "Anxious to clear out EV inventory before the arrival of new models in November, dealerships have been offering their own incentives, such as monthly lease rates that are are as little as 1% of the car's sticker price.",
      "The Emich Volkswagen dealership in Denver has lowered EV lease rates to $40 a month. \"This deal is absurd and it's never gonna happen again,\" Philip De Jong, the marketing director at Emich, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One customer at the Denver dealership, Stephen Hynes, told CBS News' senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that that he would save as much as $400 a month compared with his last car payment.",
      "\"I'm getting an electric vehicle now; it's because of this tax credit,\" said Hynes.",
      "A chart below from Cars.com\u00a0shows which vehicles are still eligible for the federal tax credit, based on information from Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "What will happen after the tax credit ends?",
      "September 2025 could end up being the \"single biggest EV month in history,\" Tim Horvick, owner of the San Tan Ford dealership outside of Phoenix, told CBS' Van Cleave. But come October, when the EV credit is no longer in effect, the sales landscape could shift.",
      "\"It is the concern,\" Horvick said. \"It could be challenging.\"",
      "As a result of the coming end of the tax credit, along with other\u00a0policy changes introduced by the Trump administration, automakers have already slowed their production of electric vehicles, shifting their attention to more popular gas and hybrid models, CBS News reported.",
      "But not all experts believe the expiration of the tax credit will have a huge effect on future EV sales, and that's simply because sales were low to begin with.",
      "EV sales \"can't fall off a cliff because they're not very high,\" Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy, told CBS News' Van Cleave. \"They're gonna fall off a small hill because that's as high as they got.\"",
      "Electric vehicles make up about 7% of new car sales, according to Anderson Economic Group. A recent analysis from Kelley Blue Book shows EV sales in August accounted for a record 9.9% of total car sales, up from 9.1% in July.",

    "story": [
      "Americans will dish out more money to heat their homes this winter as electricity and natural gas costs continue to soar.",
      "That's according to a new study from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) which predicts that\u00a0Americans will see their energy bill rise 7.6% to $976 on average this cold weather season. Those who rely on natural gas to heat their home could see an 8.4% jump in their bill, while those who use electricity could see a 10.2% increase.",
      "While electricity\u00a0prices vary\u00a0by state, overall the cost is rising. In August, prices increased by 6.2% compared with the same month last year, according to the latest inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Those costs will continue to escalate as much as 18% in the next few years, according to a May\u00a0report\u00a0from The U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Natural gas prices are up 13.8% from last year, far outpacing the rate of inflation, which rose 2.9% in August on an annual basis.",
      "Not all Americans will see an increase in their winter energy bills. Heating oil and propane users \u2014 roughly only 10% of U.S. households \u2014 could see their energy bills decrease by 4% and 5% respectively.",
      "The overall rising home-heating costs follow greater summer air-conditioning use, amid warmer temperatures. \"The average summer household electricity bill reached an estimated $776 in 2025, the highest in at least 12 years compounding household strain,\" the report states.",
      "\"We had a period of relatively stable electric bills and then last year electricity went up twice the rate of inflation,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As a result, more American households are falling behind on their energy bills.",
      "Since Dec. 31, 2023, energy arrearages \u2014 unpaid energy bills that homeowners owe to their utility company \u2014 have risen by about 31%, from approximately $17.5 billion to $23.0 billion by June 30, 2025, NEADA said in its report.",
      "The surge in energy arrearages comes as Americans are carrying\u00a0record amounts of debt. With inflation continuing to ramp up the cost of daily living, ahead of wages, total household debt reached $18.39 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with unpaid credit card balances exceeding $1.21 trillion.",
      "Why are energy prices rising?",
      "The main factors driving up energy prices is the ongoing high cost of maintaining and upgrading the grid, along with rising natural gas prices and increasing electricity demand from data centers according to the NEADA report.",
      "\"As demand goes up and supply is not matching that, prices are going to go up,\" Abe Scarr, director of the Energy and Utilities Program at the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), told CBS MoneyWatch",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine also\u00a0created volatility\u00a0in energy prices, government data shows.",
      "So far this year, approximately 60 utility companies have either increased electricity and gas prices or proposed further increases,\u00a0according to the Center for American Progress, a Washington D.C.-based think tank. With more rate hikes on the horizon, American households will have to try to stretch their income even further.",
      "\"Families just finished paying their high electric bills for the summer, and now they're looking at high bills for the winter,\" Wolfe said.",
      "How to lower your utility bills",
      "As winter approaches, what can Americans do to lower their utility bill?",
      "Scarr suggests that people check with their utility companies, which often offer incentive programs to help customers implement cost-saving measures. Offerings vary by utility, but many companies provide free home energy assessments and discounts for people who want to insulate their homes.",
      "For those interested in fortifying the envelope of their home to minimize heat loss, options include hiring a contractor for a professional retrofit or, for straightforward insulation projects, DIY tips, he said.",
      "When it comes to general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. While it might seem obvious, people can also turn down the temperature in the home a few degrees to save money, said Scarr.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-h1b-visa-faq-100000-fee-uscis/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:09:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Heavy new H-1B visa fee raises numerous questions, immigration law experts told CBS News. Here's what employees and employers should know.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is sowing confusion among some immigrant workers and their employers, including whether it's safe for current holders of the visa to travel outside the U.S.",
      "The new fee, which President Trump announced in a proclamation on Friday, represents a major change to a 35-year-old program that has enabled millions of immigrants to work legally in the U.S. The visa has become a mainstay in the technology industry, including among bellwethers such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and is also widely used in the financial sector.",
      "Over the weekend, the White House sought to\u00a0clarify\u00a0the new policy, stating that the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and that it is a one-time cost required only when initially applying for the visa.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the addition of a $100,000 charge for H-1B visas on top of the existing fees reflects President Trump's promise \"to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "She added, \"The text of the proclamation is very clear, and it is unfortunate that uninformed reporters and corporate lawyers attempt to sow chaos and confusion. Americans have another reason to celebrate unprecedented action by President Trump to protect Americans from cheap foreign labor.\"",
      "After the White House outlined the new policy on Friday, some tech companies including Google and Microsoft this weekend instructed H-1B employees who were traveling outside the U.S. to return immediately, expressing concern they might not be allowed to re-enter without the $100,000 payment, according to workers and immigration lawyers.",
      "Despite the White House's clarification that the new fee applies only to new visa applications, not existing H-1B holders, there remains \"a great degree of uncertainty on the ground,\" Parul Koul, president of the union that represents employees at Google owner Alphabet, said during a press conference on Monday to address the new policy.",
      "On Tuesday, the Trump administration published a proposal to change how H-1B visas are allotted, switching from a randomized lottery to a system that would favor immigrants with higher skills and incomes.",
      "CBS News spoke with attorneys and other sources about the new policy \u2014 here's what to know.",
      "Who pays the $100,000 fee?",
      "Under current H-1B rules, employers pay the application fees on behalf of workers. Assuming that approach continues, that could deter many employers from picking up the additional $100,000 fees \u2014 roughly 10 times what they previously paid for an applicant, Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney and managing partner at Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Very few employers would be willing to shell out that kind of money,\" she said.",
      "Such an outcome would appear to align with the White House's goals of spurring employers to hire within the U.S. rather than recruiting foreign workers.",
      "\"It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",
      "When does the fee go into effect?",
      "The new fee must be paid in submitting any new H-1B visa application and went into effect at 12:01 am EST on Sept. 21, according to a White House\u00a0statement.",
      "Each year, the federal government approves 85,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled non-U.S. workers, who typically require at least a bachelor's degree and a skill in a highly specialized field,\u00a0according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An estimated 700,000 people in the U.S. hold a H-1B visa, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The USCIS says it has already reached its applicant cap for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means those applications would be excluded from having to pay the fee, but new applicants filing during the next fiscal year would be subject to it, Neumann explained.",
      "What are the main issues for current H-1B holders?",
      "According to the White House, the proclamation \"does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa from traveling in and out of the United States.\"",
      "H-1B visas are valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years. A White House official said the one-time $100,000 fee is only charged when applying for a visa for the first time \u2014 the payment is not required for current visa holders or those renewing the document, and those fees aren't changing.",
      "Yet the new rules leave some gray areas for current H-1B holders, Neumann said. For instance, the new fee is targeted at new visa applicants residing outside the U.S. That raises questions about whether current H-1B visa holders who are applying for changes, such as a visa renewal or a change of employer, might be caught up in the new requirement if they leave the U.S., Neumann and other immigration attorneys said.",
      "\"Where the question comes in is, what if after September 21 they file that extension and then they need to travel \u2014 are they going to be expected to pay that in order to get back into the U.S.?\" she said. \"That's kind of an open question right now.\"",
      "Although the White House said the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and won't impact their travel, Neumann said she believes more guidance is needed because the White House's Sept. 21 FAQ notes the fee applies to \"any other H-1B petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025.\"",
      "\"This makes it sound like it could apply to an employee who travels with any petition filed after September 21, 2025. Although it seems clear that it does not apply to individuals currently in the United States, it is not clear how it impacts those who later travel and have a petition filed after the relevant date,\" she said.",
      "For now, Neumann said she is advising her corporate clients to direct their H-1B employees not to leave the U.S.. That was echoed by Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and an immigration attorney.",
      "\"Until we have more clarification, which hopefully we'll have soon, we're telling people to just sit tight and not travel,\" Joseph said.",
      "Asked about the issue of H-1B holders who are applying for a change and who travel outside the U.S., the White House said the one-time $100,000 fee doesn't apply to renewals or current visa holders.",
      "How does the new fee impact the H-1B program?",
      "The $100,000 fee is likely to have a \"chilling effect\" on skilled foreign workers moving to the U.S.,\u00a0Joseph of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said.",
      "Although the tech industry has long been the biggest beneficiary of the H-1B program, the visa is designed for highly skilled workers across many industries, he added. Employers who rely on the visa include those in health care, which often recruit medical professionals outside the U.S. in areas where they have shortages, he said.",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders come from a range of countries, including Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a 2022 USCIS\u00a0report.",
      "What about the national security exemption?",
      "A provision in Mr. Trump's proclamation exempts some workers, companies and even entire industries from the new $100,000 fee if they are deemed to support the \"national interest\" and are adjudged not to pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S.",
      "For now, however, it's unclear how to receive such an exemption, including which federal agency will be charged with approving them, Neumann said.",
      "\"There's no guidance out there yet,\" she said. \"What are the national interest exemptions going to be? How would a company apply for that, if they can get the entire company to get the exemption? How would the individual apply?\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about how the national security exemption would be applied or which agency will be handling the issue.",

    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

      "On Monday, Spirit said it would discharge approximately 1,800 of its 5,200 flight attendants, an airline spokesperson confirmed to CBS News. The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first\u00a0reported Spirit's plan to furlough workers.",

      "Spirit added that it is committed to treating employees affected by the restructuring with \"care and respect during this process.\"",

      "\"These evaluations will inevitably affect the size of our teams as we become a more efficient airline. Unfortunately, these are the tough calls we must make to emerge stronger.

    "summary": "The two sides will spend the next two weeks presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that threatens to dismantle the search giant's empire.",
    "story": [
      "After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising.",
      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",
      "Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions.",
      "Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission.",
      "No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined.",
      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",
      "If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology \u2014 a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would \"invite disruption and damage\" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",
      "Google believes it has already made enough changes to its \"Ad Manager\" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling.",
      "The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct.",
      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \"radical\" proposals.",
      "The Justice Department is \"fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,\" Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial.",

    "story": [
      "Emeline Lakrout, a busy New Yorker with a knack for running, rock climbing and swimming, doesn't let being legally blind stop her from living an active lifestyle.",
      "Despite being declared blind at 8 years old, Lakrout has taken on challenges, such as running the New York City Marathon and joining the U.S. National Paraclimbing Team. A new piece of technology \u2014 Meta's AI glasses \u2014 is her latest tool to help her stay savvy and adaptable on a daily basis.",
      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",
      "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the technology.",
      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",
      "The glasses, however, are work in progress says Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind.",
      "\"(They) work well for some things, doesn't work well in other situations,\" he said.",
      "Lakrout discovered this for herself. When she tried the glasses on in a restaurant, they read the menu to her perfectly but couldn't tell her the price for a specific item on second prompt. When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

    "summary": "Even if people qualify for financial help with their hospital bills, the care they receive may not be covered.",
    "story": [
      "Quinn Cochran-Zipp went to the emergency room three times with severe abdominal pain before doctors figured out that she had early-stage cancer in the germ cells of her right ovary. After emergency surgery four years ago, the Greeley, Colorado, lab technician is cancer-free.",
      "The two hospitals that treated Cochran-Zipp at the time determined that she qualified for 100% financial assistance, since her income as a college student was extremely low. Not having to worry about the roughly $100,000 in bills she racked up for her care was an enormous relief, she said.",
      "Then she started receiving unexpected bills from doctors who worked at the hospitals but, because they weren't on staff there, didn't have to abide by the facilities' financial assistance policies.",
      "Those bills, which came from specialists in emergency medicine, anesthesiology, and radiology who treated her, totaled more than $5,000. Although it was a fraction of the total cost of her care, to Cochran-Zipp it was an enormous amount. She went on payment plans and used scholarship and COVID stimulus money to help cover the bills.",
      "Cochran-Zipp, now 25 and working at a community health center, is applying to medical schools and hopes to enroll next fall. Her experience as a patient has shaped how she thinks about becoming a doctor.",
      "\"I don't think that I could be a provider that, in good conscience, charges patients money in addition to the hospital fees,\" she said.",
      "Hospital financial assistance programs are commonplace, and many patients rely on them. Most offer varying amounts of financial help to uninsured and lower-income people. Eligibility is typically based on a sliding income scale. Some hospitals apply other tests, such as residency.",
      "But even if people qualify for assistance, they may not get discounts. That's because many physicians working at but not for a hospital aren't bound by its financial assistance policies. Hospitals themselves might limit the types of services eligible for discounted or \"charity care,\" as it's sometimes called.",
      "\"It's a hole in the system,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation, a nonprofit that helps patients with serious illnesses cover their medical bills. Case managers who work with patients report that they've seen these problems repeatedly, Donovan said.",
      "In the coming years, more patients will encounter difficulties as demand for financial assistance grows. More than 14 million people are projected to lose health insurance over the next decade, primarily because of changes to the federal Medicaid program and state insurance marketplaces in recently passed tax and spending legislation championed by the Trump administration. Some of these people will likely qualify for discounted care.",
      "Nonprofit hospitals do not pay taxes on the money they make, but to maintain that tax-exempt status, they are required to have policies to help patients pay for emergency and other medically necessary care. For-profit hospitals are not required to offer financial assistance to needy patients, but many do.",
      "However, physicians and other providers who work in a hospital as independent contractors rather than as employees are often not subject to a hospital's financial assistance policy. According to an analysis by the Lown Institute, a health care think tank, physician services in the emergency, radiology, anesthesia, and pathology specialties are commonly excluded from hospital charity care.",
      "For example, at Hartford HealthCare, a large nonprofit health system serving Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, services performed by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants employed by HHC, including emergency department physicians at four of its hospitals, are covered by its financial assistance policy. But treatment by emergency physicians at three HHC hospitals is not covered by the financial assistance policy, since they are not employees. Care by doctors working in radiology, pathology, and anesthesia isn't covered by the financial assistance policy at any HHC facility.",
      "Hartford HealthCare declined to comment on the record for this article.",
      "Health system researchers have identified another potential barrier to patients' receiving help from hospital financial assistance policies. IRS rules require that nonprofit hospitals include emergency and medically necessary care in their charity care policies, but they give hospitals substantial leeway to define what \"medically necessary\" care means.",
      "Historically, excluded care has been limited to services that insurance doesn't typically cover, like cosmetic surgery or experimental treatment. But in recent years, hospitals appear to be defining medically necessary care more narrowly, eliminating financial assistance for care that is needed but not urgently required. Care that might fall into this category could be a kidney stone removal, a cancer biopsy, or a cardiac valve replacement, according to a study published this year in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Although the study of 209 nonprofit hospitals with more than 200 beds found only isolated examples of hospitals \u2014 about 6% of them \u2014 that substantially excluded medically necessary care, researchers are concerned that it could be the leading edge of a larger trend, said Mark Hall, a professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, who co-authored the study.",
      "\"There's not really much in the way of regulatory guidance in what should be in or out\" of a financial assistance policy, said Christopher Goodman, a clinical assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, who has published several studies examining hospital financial assistance policies.",
      "The American Hospital Association declined to comment for this article. American Medical Association spokesperson Robert Mills said that the AMA doesn't have a position on whether all contracted physicians should be required to participate in hospital financial assistance policies.",
      "For-profit hospitals have more latitude to fashion their financial assistance policies as they wish.",
      "At HCA Healthcare, one of the country's largest for-profit health care systems, with nearly 200 hospitals in 20 states and the United Kingdom, discounted or free care is available only for \"emergent or non-elective services.\"",
      "\"Facility charity policies and uninsured discounts are typically specific to emergency services\" at HCA Healthcare, said Harlow Sumerford, an HCA Healthcare spokesperson. \"Any third-party providers are independent and would have their own financial policies.\"",
      "In recent years, several states have passed medical debt protection laws. A few apply to some doctors and other health care providers who practice at health care facilities and bill patients separately for their care.",
      "Colorado's is the most expansive. Under its Hospital Discounted Care law that first took effect in September 2022, covered hospitals have to screen all uninsured people and others who request it for eligibility for Medicaid and other health programs, and provide discounted care to people whose income is up to 250% of the federal poverty level (about $80,000 for a family of four). There are limits on how much qualifying patients can be billed each month and, after three years, their debt is retired.",
      "Under the Colorado law, licensed health care professionals who work at a covered hospital can charge qualified patients no more than the rates set by the state.",
      "\"This rule has been a game changer for folks in Colorado,\" said Melissa Duncan, consumer assistance program manager at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, which helps patients access health care and cover their bills.",
      "Unfortunately, the law didn't pass in time to help Cochran-Zipp.",
      "As hospitals grapple with the changes expected under the federal health care legislation passed this summer, discounted care programs may make a tempting target, say some health care financing experts. Facing higher rates of uncompensated care and trouble collecting payments from patients, facilities may reduce the financial assistance that they offer.",
      "Hospitals may say \"we are going to do all we can to protect our spending,\" said Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University. \"In that environment, charity care will be a burden.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is adding $100,000 to the existing fee for H-1B visa applications, taking aim at a program that is used to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S.",
      "President Trump signed a proclamation late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.",
      "\"We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson clarified to CBS News in an email Saturday that the fee \"does not apply to anyone who has a current visa,\" and \"only applies to future applicants in the February [2026] lottery who are currently outside the U.S. It does not apply to anyone who participated in the 2025 lottery.\"",
      "\"The Proclamation does not impact the ability of any current visa holder to travel to/from the U.S.,\" Jackson said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Saturday that the $100,000 is a one-time fee that only applies to new visas and is not an annual payment. It does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, the official said.",
      "This comes after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had told reporters Friday that the fee was \"annual.\"",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CBS News in a statement Saturday. \"It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system.\"",
      "The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have\u00a0relied on the program\u00a0to hire foreign workers.",
      "The plan was\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by Bloomberg News.",
      "H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.",
      "The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.",
      "Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the\u00a0most H1-B visas\u00a0of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.",
      "\"This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,\" a White House aide said.",
      "Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.",
      "\"The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,\" Anderson told CBS News.",
      "Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.",
      "President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.",
      "The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March\u00a0study\u00a0from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.",

      "Americans' grocery bills are growing, causing some shoppers to cut back on discretionary spending as they find themselves struggling to afford the basics.",
      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",
      "\"What they want to do is they want to protect themselves. A lot of these big food companies are public companies. So what they've gotta do is they've gotta report back to their shareholders on profit margins. So they've been hedging their bets,\" Lempert said.",
      "Sometimes, packaged-goods companies disguise price hikes by offering consumers less product for the same amount of money. The covert inflation strategy has been dubbed \"shrinkflation,\" Lempert explained.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not gonna observe that and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" he said",
      "Climate change",
      "Increasing temperatures and\u00a0shifts in weather patterns have made conditions for growing some fruits and vegetables in the U.S. inhospitable. As a result, a lot of domestic production has been moved to Central and Latin America, according to Lempert.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" he said.",
      "Labor shortage",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including raids on workplaces that employ large numbers of immigrants, plus waning interest in agricultural work, have led to an industrywide labor shortage, Lempert explained.",
      "Consumers are reacting to higher prices by looking for deals, purchasing store brand goods instead of name-brands and buying shelf-stable groceries in bulk at shopping clubs like Costco.",
      "Lempert said a little planning can go a long way to ensure that consumers can buy what they need.",
      "\"The number one thing that people want to do if they want to save money \u2014 stop wasting food,\" Lempert said.",
      "\"Forty percent of all of our food in this country is wasted. A lot of that's in our homes. So, take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers, don't waste food and you'll save a substantial amount of money,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) sent a memo to federal agencies Wednesday night telling them to prepare layoff plans if there is a government shutdown, increasing the stakes ahead of Congress' Tuesday deadline to pass a government funding bill.",
      "The news was first reported by Politico.",
      "The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices \u2014 a federal term for layoffs \u2014 for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects \"not consistent with the President's priorities.\"",
      "The RIF notices would be in addition to any furlough notices directing federal workers to stay home from work without pay if there is a shutdown, the memo states.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo states.",
      "An OMB official said that several programs will continue regardless of a shutdown, including Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, military operations, law enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and air traffic control. These are statutory federal programs and would not be impacted by any potential reductions-in-force.",
      "\"We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary. The President supports enactment of a clean CR to ensure no discretionary spending lapse after September 30, 2025, and OMB hopes the Democrats will agree,\" the memo ends with.",
      "During the last few major government shutdowns, the executive branch has temporarily furloughed staff who are deemed non-essential and asked people in critical jobs to keep working without pay. After the shutdown ends, federal workers are normally paid back for their missed paychecks. It's far less common for the government to consider permanent layoffs.",
      "Bobby Kogan, a former OMB official during the Biden administration, said the mass firings would be \"an action of enormous self-harm inflicted on the nation, needlessly ridding the country of talent and expertise.\"",
      "\"It's also extortive. 'Give us what we want in a funding fight, or we'll hurt the country,'\" Kogan said in a statement.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the memo \"an attempt at intimidation.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one\u2014not to govern, but to scare. This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government,\" he wrote, predicting that any laid-off workers will be hired back.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also a New York Democrat, wrote on X: \"We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings. Get lost.\"",
      "The current fiscal year ends on Tuesday, Sept. 30, meaning the government will enter a shutdown Wednesday if Congress doesn't pass a new funding package.",
      "A Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House has failed to reach the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate. With a 53-seat Senate majority, Republicans need to earn the support of at least seven Democrats to resolve the funding dispute. Meanwhile, Democrats are asking for several concessions, including a rollback of this year's Medicaid cuts and an extension to health insurance tax credits, in exchange for their votes.",
      "On Tuesday, President Trump canceled a meeting with Democratic congressional leaders to negotiate on a short-term funding patch, saying that their demands were \"unserious and ridiculous.\"",

    "summary": "Federal prosecutors are considering asking a grand jury to indict former FBI Director James Comey, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal prosecutors are nearing a decision about whether to seek an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime foe of President Trump's, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CBS News.",
      "It's unclear what alleged crimes Comey could be charged with, but multiple media outlets have reported that prosecutors have looked into charging him with lying to Congress when he testified in 2020 about the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The five-year statute of limitations for that runs out on Tuesday.",
      "Prosecutors are considering presenting a case against Comey to a grand jury, sources told CBS News. In order to indict him, a majority of the grand jury would need to vote that there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed \u2014 a lower standard than the burden of proof needed to secure a criminal conviction.",
      "If Comey is charged, it would mark a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration's push to punish the president's adversaries. Just four days ago, Mr. Trump penned a Truth Social post that appeared to urge Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into Comey, among others, calling them \"guilty as hell\" and writing, \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said Saturday he had fired the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia. A day earlier, the official, Erik Siebert, announced his resignation amid concerns from prosecutors in the office that he could be removed for refusing to charge another Trump political foe, New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer Lindsey Halligan, who has no prosecutorial experience, was sworn in as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia on Monday.",
      "Comey and the president have sparred for years. In the lead-up to the 2016 election, Comey oversaw investigations into alleged Russian election interference \u2014 including whether Russia sought to aid Mr. Trump's campaign \u2014 and into Hillary Clinton's private email server. The FBI's handling of both probes has drawn heavy scrutiny, and the Russia investigation, dubbed \"Crossfire Hurricane,\" has long outraged Mr. Trump and his allies.",
      "Mr. Trump fired Comey months into his first term in 2017, and the two have slammed each other periodically ever since. Comey has called Mr. Trump \"morally unfit\" to be president and has accused Mr. Trump of demanding that Comey pledge his loyalty to him when he was FBI director. Mr. Trump has accused Comey of lying and suggested he should be jailed.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's return to office, he has continued to rail against the FBI and other agencies involved in the Russia probe. In recent months, the Justice Department has been investigating the handling of classified Russia-related materials by former senior FBI officials, and intelligence agencies have revisited their Russia investigations. In 2017, U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 race and had a preference for Mr. Trump.",
      "The handling of the Comey probe has worried some legal experts.",
      "\"What is different about this case is that there clearly has been significant presidential pressure brought to bear,\" Tom Dupree, a George W. Bush-era Justice Department official, told CBS News. \"You don't want a universe in which that pressure distorts the prosecutorial judgement and makes prosecutors make charging decisions based not on the evidence, but on what they think will please the president.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration faced a legal setback in its push to cut off funding to \"sanctuary\" cities and states",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge ruled Wednesday it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to get some Federal Emergency Management Agency grants \u2014 a legal setback in the administration's push to revoke funding to \"sanctuary\" cities and states.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Smith of Rhode Island ruled in favor of 20 mostly Democratic states that had sued FEMA, accusing the administration of \"holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage\" unless they assist immigration agents.",
      "The decision is likely to be appealed.",
      "The states that sued \u2014 which include California, New York and Illinois \u2014 took issue with a Department of Homeland Security document issued earlier this year that says recipients of DHS grants must \"honor requests for cooperation\" with immigration authorities, including requests to detain migrants or share information. Some of the plaintiffs are \"sanctuary\" states that have laws restricting cooperation between police and immigration agents.",
      "The states argued this move violates federal law and the Constitution, and could deprive them of billions per year in key disaster grants from FEMA, which is a sub-agency of DHS.",
      "The Trump administration has argued its policy doesn't violate the law. Also, months after the lawsuit was filed, the government told the court it had decided most of the FEMA disaster grants that the states were concerned about losing will not be tied to immigration cooperation after all. The administration called the lawsuit moot on those grounds.",
      "The states called the Trump administration's decision not to link disaster grants to immigration enforcement \"halfhearted and incomplete,\" arguing it's unclear if the decision was communicated to agency staff or if it will apply to years beyond 2025.",
      "In a 45-page ruling Wednesday, Smith sided with the states and granted summary judgment, calling the policy \"both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"Plaintiff States stand to suffer irreparable harm; the effect of the loss of emergency and disaster funds cannot be recovered later, and the downstream effect on disaster response and public safety are real and not compensable,\" Smith wrote.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James hailed the ruling in a statement, writing: \"The federal government cannot prioritize its cruel immigration agenda over Americans' safety. Today, the court affirmed that it is blatantly unconstitutional for DHS to hold life-saving disaster relief funds hostage to advance its anti-immigration efforts.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin asserted in a statement that cities and states that \"break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that,\" she wrote.",
      "The ruling follows a monthslong gambit by President Trump to punish \"sanctuary\" cities and states that limit cooperation between the police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "The Trump administration argues that those jurisdictions make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented immigrants, including accused criminals and people who are in state or local custody. But \"sanctuary\" cities and states typically argue that requiring them to cooperate with ICE would undermine trust in local police and make some immigrants wary of reporting crimes.",
      "Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order telling federal agencies to ensure that \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Since then, several agencies have moved to restrict grants to \"sanctuary\" cities and states, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Those moves have drawn lawsuits from Democratic cities and states. Last month, a San Francisco-based judge blocked the Trump administration from cutting off funding to almost three dozen cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Boston.",

      "On Wednesday, ICE said in a statement that a gunman began firing \"indiscriminately\" at the field office and its entryway early in the morning. Three detainees were shot, and one died, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE. (The department initially said two detainees had died before issuing a correction.)",
      "No ICE officials were injured, and the gunman died of a self-inflicted gunshot, according to ICE.",
      "Joe Rothrock, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas office, said the bureau was investigating the shooting as an \"act of targeted violence.\"",
      "\"Early evidence that we've seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature,\" Rothrock said at a news conference. FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on X showing a bullet with \"ANTI-ICE\" written on it.",

The man, Bratton Dean Wilkinson, allegedly said he had a bomb in his backpack. A bomb squad cleared the scene and the suspect was charged with false reporting to induce an emergency response.",
      "Officials have not identified the gunman in Wednesday's shooting, and have not said whether the August bomb threat was related. But Homeland Security officials have highlighted a spate of threats and attacks against federal facilities and personnel, including two other recent incidents in Texas.",

      "It followed a political and media firestorm that began after the comedian addressed Kirk's slaying in a Sept. 15 monologue, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"",
      "An emotional Kimmel on Tuesday said, \"It's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it,\" noting that he had taken to social media following Kirk's killing to send his condolences to Kirk's family.",
      "Kimmel didn't issue a blanket apology for his monologue remarks last week, but said he understood how it was offensive to some.",
      "\"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual,\" Kimmel said of the suspected gunman. \"That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did, point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation was reversed, there's a good chance I'd have felt the same way.\"",
      "Kimmel gave a brief explanation for what took place behind the scenes between himself and ABC's brass.",
      "\"I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday,\" Kimmel said. \"I did not agree with that decision, and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company \u2026 they welcomed me back on the air.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!\"",
      "He went on, \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,\" Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, which the network settled in December by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million toward Mr. Trump's legal fees.",
      "\"This one sounds even more lucrative,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"A true bunch of losers!\"",
      "Kimmel told his audience Tuesday that the president \"made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.\"",
      "\"One thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like, is anti-American,\" he added.",
      "In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" Carr told Johnson. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "ABC later said that it was \"indefinitely\" suspending the show.",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to preempt Kimmel's show.",
      "Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",
      "Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"monitor the show as it returns to ABC.\"",
      "Regarding Carr, Kimmel on Tuesday\u00a0showed\u00a0the audience a social media post that the FCC chair wrote in May 2022 in which he said, \"Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people in to the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.\"",
      "Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" calling his comments \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities \u2014 including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep \u2014 signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"",
      "Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform \"for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also speculated last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" the president told reporters on Sept. 18. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'\" Cruz said Friday on his podcast. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"",

    "summary": "A malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter at the United Nations' headquarters drew President Trump's frustration.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump accused the United Nations of \"sabotage\" and demanded an investigation Wednesday after an escalator and teleprompter malfunctioned during his visit to U.N. headquarters \u2014 though the U.N. says a videographer from Mr. Trump's delegation may have triggered the escalator's safety shutoff.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump entered U.N. headquarters in New York City on Tuesday to address world leaders at this year's General Assembly session, they stepped onto an escalator. But the machine ground to a halt almost immediately, forcing both Trumps to start climbing the stairs on their own, videos of his arrival show.",
      "Later, as Mr. Trump began his speech to the General Assembly, he remarked that his teleprompter wasn't working. \"I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,\" the president said, drawing laughs from the audience.",
      "The president brought up the two mishaps later in his speech, framing them as metaphors for what he views as the incompetence of the United Nations \u2014 which he accused of offering up little more than \"empty words.\"",
      "\"All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would've fallen,\" the president said. \"These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post a day later, Mr. Trump claimed the incidents were not a coincidence. He also leveled a third allegation that \"the sound was completely off\" during his speech.",
      "\"A REAL DISGRACE took place at the United Nations yesterday \u2014 Not one, not two, but three very sinister events!\" the president wrote. \"This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.\"",
      "Mr. Trump pushed for an \"immediate investigation\" by the United Nations.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt floated a similar explanation on Tuesday, writing in a post on X: \"If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately.\"",
      "Leavitt shared a screenshot from a Times of London article that reported U.N. workers had been overheard joking they might intentionally shut off escalators during Mr. Trump's visit and blame funding shortfalls. There is no evidence that U.N. staff followed through on those jokes.",
      "The press secretary later told Fox News that the Secret Service is looking into the matter, telling host Jesse Watters that \"it doesn't look like a coincidence to me.\" A federal law enforcement source confirmed to CBS News that the Secret Service is looking into the escalator issue.",
      "However, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday the escalator may have suddenly stopped because of a videographer from the U.S. delegation who can be seen walking ahead of the president and first lady on the escalator, seemingly to film their arrival.",
      "\"A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator. The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing. The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function described above,\" St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said in a statement.",
      "Separately, a U.N. official told CBS News that the White House operated the teleprompter for Mr. Trump when it malfunctioned during his speech.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment about the U.N.'s findings.",
      "Mr. Trump's speech came as his second administration distances itself from the U.N., withdrawing the U.S. from agencies like the Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. The administration has also cut its financial contributions to the U.N. and criticized its approach to Israel.",
      "\"The U.N. has such tremendous potential,\" the president said in his speech, \"but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.\"",

    "story": [
      "Many doctors and public health officials are taking issue with President Trump's claim that there's \"no downside\" to avoiding acetaminophen during pregnancy and his suggestion that expecting mothers should \"tough it out\" when it comes to fevers.",
      "Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications, is used to reduce pain and fever in pregnancy.",
      "\"Don't take it. There's no downside in not taking it,\" Mr. Trump said during an announcement Monday that linked the use of the drug during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children without giving new evidence and ignoring data that shows there is not a causal relation.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration is \"strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary,\" he said. \"That's, for instance, in cases of extremely high fever that you feel you can't tough it out, you can't do it. I guess there's that. It's a small number of cases, I think. But if you can't tough it out, if you can't do it, that's what you're going to have to do. You'll take a Tylenol.\"",
      "In an open letter to physicians released after Mr. Trump's announcement, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary was more cautious than the president, writing, \"clinicians should consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers.\"",
      "But doctors worry the suggestion to \"tough it out\" will harm women and their babies, as high fever and pain can be dangerous during pregnancy.",
      "\"The messaging of 'tough it out' is something that unfortunately we have said to women in health care in this country for far too long,\" Dr. Lucky Sekhon, an OB/GYN and infertility specialist in New York City, told CBS News.",
      "There's also a concern patients may turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy. Makary noted in his letter that \"acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics.\" (Antipyretics are drugs that reduce fever.)",
      "In a statement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "\"Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives,\" the company said.",
      "The risks of fever during pregnancy",
      "Medical experts warn that fevers during pregnancy can cause problems for a developing baby.",
      "Especially in early pregnancy, fevers are associated with cardiac issues, cleft lip, cleft palate and central nervous system abnormalities, Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News after Mr. Trump's announcement.",
      "\"The idea that we're going to let someone with a fever 'tough it out' may have much worse implications for a pregnant woman than taking a dose of acetaminophen to bring that fever down,\" he said. \"I think that's not really an appropriate way to handle medical issues in pregnancy.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, echoed it's important to not let fevers go untreated due to the risk of brain development issues in the baby.",
      "\"Fever and infections during pregnancy can cause neurodevelopmental disorders including potentially autism,\" she said. \"I worry that this will scare women and that pregnant women may avoid Tylenol even when it's entirely appropriate, for example, to treat a fever.\"",
      "Internal medicine physician Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider said science does not support the administration's claims.",
      "\"What's far riskier is leaving a fever untreated during pregnancy which can harm both mom and baby, so Tylenol remains the safest option we have in those situations,\" she said.",
      "Why Tylenol or acetaminophen is advised",
      "Gounder said she's concerned that expectant mothers with a fever or pain may turn to other options that would be less safe.",
      "\"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby,\" she said.",
      "Fleischman agreed that acetaminophen is the safest option.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" he told CBS News. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "That research, he explained, includes a large study published last year\u00a0which analyzed data on 2.5 million pregnancies and found no increased risk of autism in children whose mothers took acetaminophen.",
      "The lead author of that study, Viktor H. Ahlqvist, PhD, of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, said in an interview that acetaminophen continues to be \"the recommended option\" for use during pregnancy.",
      "He shared the concern that \"alternatives to acetaminophen in the U.S. might be other medications with less-safe profiles, such as opioids or other things to manage pain. We do know that these have serious consequences when used in pregnancy, both for the mom and for the baby.\"",
      "These doctors are not alone. Health experts from around the world have pushed back against the Trump administration's claims about acetaminophen and autism.",
      "The European Union's European Medicines Agency said Tuesday there is \"no new evidence\" that would require changes to the current recommendations for use of acetaminophen, also called paracetamol outside the U.S.",
      "\"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,\" Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. \"Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.\"",
      "What should pregnant women do?",
      "Pregnant patients should consult with their doctor on what's the best for them, but Fleischman pointed out that acetaminophen is only used when necessary.",
      "\"You don't take Tylenol just for fun. \u2026 It's not like a [daily] vitamin, and we would never treat it that way,\" he said. \"Patients are told to use acetaminophen when they have a fever, when they have a headache or other pain symptoms in pregnancy which require treatment.\"",
      "The medication is generally recommended for a fever above 100.4, Fleischman explained.",
      "\"We know that higher fevers are definitely associated with more issues but if your temperature is above 100.4, taking acetaminophen to bring that down is definitely advised,\" he said.",
      "A single extra-strength dose, which is 500 mg, should be \"more than adequate,\" he added, but said it can be repeated if needed.",
      "\"As always, we want our patients to consult with their health care provider before using any medications, but all of the data shows that it's safe and there is no data that shows Tylenol causes autism,\" Dr. Veronica Gillispie-Bell, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, told CBS News.",
      "She shared concerns over the FDA initiating a label change on Tylenol and acetaminophen to warn of a possible association with autism.",
      "\"I think it will make our moms scared to take Tylenol, and the repercussions, again, for those moms that are having fever and those moms that are having pain, those repercussions can be very detrimental. And it's really shameful when we know that Tylenol is safe and again we have no studies showing that it causes autism,\" Gillispie-Bell said.",

      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes declined the officials' request for an order allowing them to return to their jobs as inspectors general unless Mr. Trump removes them in a way that complies with federal law. Reyes said the plaintiffs, eight former government watchdogs, failed to show that they had suffered irreparable harm as a result of their firings.",
      "She noted that even if the officials were reinstated to their roles, as they asked to be, Mr. Trump could remove them again after 30 days by providing notice and a rationale to Congress, requirements laid out in the Inspector General Act.",
      "\"The Court recognizes Plaintiffs' exceptional service as IGs, marked by decades of distinguished leadership across multiple administrations. They sacrificed much to take on the role of an IG and its many demands \u2014 no doubt including substantial time away from family and far larger paychecks available in the private sector,\" Reyes wrote in a 20-page decision. \"They deserved better from their government.

They worked at the Small Business Administration and Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Labor, State, and Veterans Affairs. Inspectors general are tasked with investigating wrongdoing and rooting out fraud and waste at government agency. They work independently from the agencies they oversee, and typically serve across Democratic and Republican administrations.",
      "The officials were informed of their firings through an email from the White House's Personnel Office, which stated that \"due to changing priorities,\" they were terminated from their respective positions \"effective immediately.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday is expected to sign\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S., according to a White House official.",
      "On Monday, a senior White House official said Mr. Trump would declare that the deal is a \"qualified divestiture\" and satisfies a law passed by Congress that requires TikTok's parent company to divest or face a ban. The declaration is expected to come in Mr. Trump's fifth executive order pushing back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in TikTok, according to the official. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "But there's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some could see the deal as not going far enough as it relates to TikTok's algorithm.",
      "As details on the deal trickled out from the administration last week, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China Committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Congress set clear legal safeguards for a deal, including precluding any cooperation with ByteDance or its affiliates on TikTok's recommendation algorithm, and prohibiting any ongoing operational relationship between a new TikTok and ByteDance,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"Based on initial reports, I am concerned the reported licensing deal may involve ongoing reliance by the new TikTok on a ByteDance algorithm and application that could allow continued CCP control or influence.\"",

      "In a joint U.S.-Mexican operation last month, authorities tracked down a cartel leader accused of running a gruesome infant trafficking ring in northern Mexico, according to senior intelligence officials.",
      "Martha Alicia Mendez Aguilar, known as \"La Diabla,\" was captured on Sept. 2 after officials say the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, referred to by the U.S. as CJNG, lured a handful of pregnant women \u2014 often in vulnerable or impoverished circumstances \u2014 to remote areas. Once there, CJNG traffickers allegedly performed illegal cesarean operations on the women, killing the mothers and allegedly harvesting their organs postmortem, and placing newborns into illicit markets, according to senior intelligence officials. The infants were then sold to couples in the United States for as much as 250,000 pesos or roughly $14,000 each, according to the senior intelligence officials.",
      "Mexican authorities were tipped off by intelligence provided by the National Counterterrorism Center, under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. NCTC Director Joe Kent called the scheme an \"example of what terrorist cartels will do to diversify their revenue streams and finance operations,\" in a statement provided to CBS News, crediting NCTC analysts with tracking Aguilar's patterns and locations, then coordinating with U.S. intelligence and Mexican partners on the ground.",
      "Senior intelligence officials say the arrest involved support from the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI El Paso, Diplomatic Security Service and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with Mexican law enforcement executing the operation alongside \"Fiscalia Especializada en la Mujer\" or the Special Prosecutor's Office for Women. Aguilar remains in Mexican custody, according to senior intelligence officials. The investigation into the alleged trafficking ring remains ongoing.",
      "The case underscores Washington's intensified targeting of Mexican cartels in recent years.",
      "In January, President Trump signed an executive order directing the State Department to designate cartels and transnational gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTOs. The State Department in February announced the designation for eight gangs, including CJNG.",
      "The capture of \"La Diabla\" marks an expansion in the application of U.S. counterterrorism policy, with intelligence elements like NCTC now actively applying counterterrorism capabilities to target not only narcotraffickers, but also human trafficking rings and terroristic violence by groups like CJNG, notorious for brutal tactics and control over swaths of Mexico's territory.",
      "Under the new FTO framing, U.S. agencies wield more expansive tools, including intelligence, sanctions, and military support to track down the cartels and their affiliates, beyond reliance on traditional criminal prosecutions. Critics of the approach have warned of overreach and unintended consequences, while proponents argue that cartels increasingly function like hybrid terrorist groups to pick up territorial control and expand trafficking networks.",
      "According to NCTC, U.S. intelligence has added over 21,000 cartel members and associates into their classified terrorist database, creating over 35,000 identities related to the newly designated foreign terrorist organizations. Last month, the agency stated that 6,525 terrorists have been denied entry into the United States since the beginning of the Trump administration.",

    "story": [
      "In response to the stabbing death of a Ukrainian refugee on Charlotte's light rail system, the North Carolina legislature gave final approval Tuesday to a criminal justice package that limits bail and seeks to ensure more defendants undergo mental health evaluations.",
      "The Republican-penned bill, called \"Iryna's Law,\" could also help restart executions in the state.",
      "The House voted 81-31 to accept the omnibus measure passed by the Senate on Monday, sending it next to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. The governor, a former attorney general, has said he supports some pretrial reforms following the fatal Aug. 22 attack on 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear whether Stein would sign the bill into law or veto it. A Stein spokesperson said he was reviewing the measure.",
      "Surveillance footage showed Zarutska entering a light rail car on Aug. 22 and sitting in a row in front of Brown. Four minutes later, the suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., allegedly pulled a knife from his pocket and struck Zarutska three times from behind, according to an FBI\u00a0affidavit\u00a0accompanying the criminal complaint.",
      "Brown had been arrested more than a dozen times and was released earlier this year by a magistrate on a misdemeanor count without any bond. Brown is charged with first-degree murder in state court and a federal count in connection with Zarutska's death. Both crimes can be punishable by the death penalty.",
      "Brown \"should have never been allowed out of the jail. The catch-and-release practices for violent offenders will end today with your support,\" Charlotte-area Republican state Rep. Tricia Cotham told colleagues during two hours of House debate. \"This heinous act was preventable.\"",
      "Public outrage over Zarutska's death intensified with the release of security video showing the attack on the commuter train, leading President Trump and GOP allies to accuse Charlotte and statewide elected Democrats of promoting soft-on-crime policies.",
      "\"Iryna's Law\" addresses bail, magistrates, behavioral health",
      "Much of the bill focuses on eliminating cashless bail for many crimes and limiting the discretion that magistrates and judges have in making pretrial release decisions.",

      "But Charlotte defense attorney Tim Emry, who previously ran for district attorney, disagreed.",
      "\"The magistrate's not asleep at the wheel,\" Emry told WBTV. \"It would be totally unconstitutional for the magistrate to hold someone without bond on a low-level misdemeanor charge.\"",
      "The bill also lays out when offenders should be examined for possible involuntary commitment.",
      "Brown's mother told media outlets that her son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.",
      "Several House Democrats took issue with the soft-on-crime label, pointing out that Republicans have controlled the General Assembly for over a decade. They said the bill falls well short in providing mental health services that advocates say could stop crimes before they occur, as well as funds to hire additional police officers and crisis responders and to house defendants being held for behavioral problems.",
      "\"Tough on crime doesn't only mean let's pay attention to punishment after the fact,\" said Democratic Rep. Marcia Morey of Durham, a former judge. \"We grieve the murder. It was senseless, it was horrible. But what you are voting on today does nothing to take it back or would have prevented it. Let's get smart on crime.\"",

      "Bill aims to end nearly 20-year halt of executions",
      "The bill initially contained language that would require certain appeals for death-row inmates be heard and reviewed by courts by the end of 2027. More than 120 people are on death row in North Carolina, but an execution hasn't been carried out since 2006.",
      "But an amendment from powerful Senate leader Phil Berger would direct the state Adult Correction Department secretary to find another form of execution if lethal injection \u2014 currently the state's sole method \u2014 is declared unconstitutional or is \"not available,\" potentially if the drugs can't be accessed.",
      "\"For nearly two decades, judicial and administrative roadblocks have stopped true justice for victims, and it's time for that to end,\" Berger said in a post shared on X.",
      "The secretary would have to select another method that's been adopted by another state. That could include the use of a firing squad, a method used to execute South Carolina inmates twice this year, or perhaps electrocution.",
      "Capital punishment has been put on hold in North Carolina in part over legal challenges on the use of the injection drugs. Inmate challenges also have occurred under a now-repealed law that has allowed some prisoners to receive life without parole if they could show racial bias was the reason for their death sentence.",
      "\"For nearly two decades, judicial and administrative roadblocks have stopped true justice for victims, and it's time for that to end,\" Berger said in a news release Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration has touted its crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., in recent weeks, with increased arrest numbers and reduced violent crime. But the surge of resources to the nation's capital hasn't extended to its courts, which have been hampered by judicial vacancies that have led to a backlog of cases and slowed the administration of justice.",
      "The crisis in the district's courts has persisted for years due to a high volume of open seats for judges. But whether, and when, it subsides rests with the president and Senate under the structure established by Congress more than 50 years ago.",
      "Today, there are 13 vacancies on the D.C Superior Court, the district's trial court, and another two judges are on extended medical leave. By January, another two sitting judges are set to retire, which would leave 15 of the Superior Court's 62 seats unfilled.",
      "On the D.C. Court of Appeals, two of its nine seats are open. One of those has been empty since November 2013, and neither have nominees awaiting approval by the Senate.",
      "\"With vacancy rates nearing 25% on the trial court, we are set up to fail those who are depending on us for fair and timely legal outcomes,\" said Douglas Buchanan, spokesman for the D.C. Courts. \"Now, in today's reality, our ability to operate is simply not sustainable. It's the case today, and it only stands to grow worse for those we serve.\"",
      "\"A lot of different gears\"",
      "The vacancy crisis underscores the unique position the district holds as the nation's capital. While judges are elected by voters or appointed by governors in other jurisdictions, the president nominates and the Senate confirms judges to the local courts in D.C., just like they do for federal courts.",
      "It's a process that Congress itself created under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. The law established a seven-member Judicial Nomination Commission, which submits a list of three candidates to fill each vacancy on the Superior Court and Appeals Court. The president then selects a person from that list to nominate for Senate confirmation.",
      "\"That requires a lot of different gears to all mesh up together when the District of Columbia doesn't even have a single senator in that room to say, 'Hey, this is important to the district,'\" said Joe Musso, president of the Trial Lawyers Association of Washington, D.C.",
      "In recent years, presidents have prioritized confirmations to the federal courts, with Mr. Trump and President Joe Biden appointing more than 230 federal judges. But filling the vacancies on the D.C. courts has not been as important.",
      "In December, the Senate had a chance to approve 10 of Biden's picks to the local courts, but the nominees were blocked. Mr. Trump can now fill those seats with his own nominees.",
      "For its part, the Judicial Nomination Commission has submitted to the president a list of candidates for every existing vacancy on the Superior Court and Appeals Court.",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has made four nominations to the D.C. Superior Court, and one is poised for a vote by the full Senate after advancing out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in July. Two of the president's four nominees are for vacancies that have existed since 2020.",
      "\"President Trump has been focused on filling vacancies in Superior Court and I strongly agree,\" Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement to CBS News. \"Not having enough judges is not only bad for the District, the prosecutors, and the attorneys, it's bad for those individuals who are awaiting a trial that will impact their civil liberties.\"",
      "While the Senate Judiciary Committee oversees nominations to the federal courts, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee handles confirmation hearings for picks to the D.C. courts.",
      "A spokesman for Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, told CBS News that the panel is processing the three other nominations \"according to our standing rules and procedures and will announce a hearing at the appropriate time.\"",
      "Still, it's unclear whether there is broad appetite in the Senate to move the president's picks for the D.C. courts, particularly as lawmakers face a fast-approaching Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government and are under pressure to approve a backlog of Mr. Trump's executive branch nominees.",
      "Meanwhile, cases filed in the Superior Court continue to stack up. In the criminal division, trials for people accused of the most serious felony offenses are being scheduled into late 2027 and early 2028, Buchanan said.",
      "\"This is not fair to the victims of these very serious crimes, nor to the defendants who stand accused and in custody while they await their day in court,\" he said.",
      "An \"urgent\" crisis",
      "Mr. Trump's crackdown on D.C. came in response to what he claimed is rampant crime that has made the nation's capital a dangerous place to live and visit, despite data showing that crime had been falling in recent years. Last month, the president deployed the National Guard to the district and placed the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control for 30 days, authority granted to him under the Home Rule Act.",
      "While the 30-day takeover of the local police department expired on Sept. 10, National Guard troops will remain on district streets through November. Muriel Bowser, the mayor of D.C., has said local police will continue close coordination with federal law enforcement indefinitely.",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's plans to address what he says is a \"crime emergency\" in the capital, the president signed an executive order last month that calls on prosecutors to pursue federal charges and pretrial detention for people arrested in the district.",
      "But government lawyers with the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C, led by Pirro, have struggled to secure indictments in a string of recent cases. In at least one of those, involving a now-fired Justice Department employee accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal officer, prosecutors filed a misdemeanor charge, which doesn't require a grand jury indictment.",
      "Pirro's office also prosecutes felony offenses and most misdemeanors committed by adults in the local trial court. From January through March, the most recent data publicly available, there was a slight uptick in felony prosecutions and cases charged in the Superior Court compared to the first three months of 2024.",
      "But the president's efforts to tamp down on crime and the alleged perpetrators are meeting a court system that has for years lacked a full complement of judges to hear and adjudicate cases.",
      "\"You're looking at criminal defendants who are sitting in jail on nothing more than a charge, and they're presumed innocent under the Constitution,\" Musso said.",
      "The ballooning number of cases filed in the Superior Court began years before Mr. Trump's crackdown. From 2021 to 2024, the trial court saw an 83% increase in new case filings, data shows. For 2025, the Superior Court is on track to either meet or exceed the 56,627 new cases from last year.",
      "For the criminal division, there were nearly 40% more felony cases filed between 2022 and 2023, and roughly 51% more misdemeanor cases brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office, according to data from the court.",
      "In a branch of the Civil Division that handles most civil disputes, the number of cases on judges' calendars has nearly doubled to roughly 500.",
      "\"This is urgent,\" said Tianna Gibbs, a law professor at American University in Washington who studies access to justice issues. \"We have a lot on the line: the administration of justice, access to justice and public confidence in the courts as a forum that can fairly and efficiently resolve their disputes.\"",
      "Meg McKinney, a family law attorney who practices in D.C., said the high number of vacancies is a problem across the Superior Court, but she believes the impact is more acutely felt in the Criminal and Family Court Operations divisions.",
      "\"You're already dealing with families who have a fair amount of crisis or dysfunction, and they're basically just twisting in the wind while they make their way through the court system,\" she said.",
      "In the family court, there were between four and six vacancies throughout 2024, and a 46% spike in new or reopened cases from 2020 to 2024, according to an annual report to Congress submitted in March. In its Domestic Relations Branch, which processes cases for divorce, custody and adoptions, among other areas, initial hearings are taking place before a magistrate judge to help ensure families can get into court quickly.",
      "But even for the small number of cases that go to trial, it can take more than a year to get a trial date, and securing consecutive days on the calendar is difficult. The wait for an actual decision may be even longer, since the time available for judges to write opinions is sparse.",
      "\"It feels like D.C. has been forgotten\"",
      "Mr. Trump has heralded the operation in D.C. as a success, and crime in the district has dropped significantly since he deployed National Guard troops and other federal law enforcement officers to the district. But local officials have urged the president and the federal government to assist D.C. in other ways.",
      "\"We have 15 vacancies in the Superior Court, which we need to go down to the Congress for approval. We have two vacancies in the Court of Appeals which we need to go down,\" Bowser, the mayor, told MSNBC in an interview last month. \"So anytime you have a backlog in the courts you have delayed justice and people are less safe.\"",
      "Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents D.C. in the House as a nonvoting delegate, warned last month that the D.C. courts are facing a \"perpetual vacancy crisis\" because of Senate inaction. She said the number of open seats on the Superior Court is \"significantly impeding D.C.'s ability to try criminal cases in court, harming public safety and access to justice.\"",
      "Norton introduced legislation in July that would give the D.C. Council authority over the jurisdiction and organization of the local courts. She has also proposed plans that would allow judicial nominees to the D.C. courts to be appointed without approval by the Senate after a 30-day congressional review period.",
      "But D.C. officials have been sounding the alarm about the vacancy crisis for years, though their appeals for help have gone unanswered. Letters sent from members of the D.C. Council, legal organizations and even sitting D.C. judges have not moved the White House or Senate to action.",
      "\"It feels like a problem where the grievance is not going to get to the person who has control of moving the levers in the process,\" said Gibbs, the American University law professor. \"It feels like D.C. has been forgotten in this way and there's no way to appeal to the powers that be to address the problem.\"",
      "Lawyers in the district pin the blame on its lack of representation in the Senate, which has left residents without a voice to pressure senators to act.",
      "\"No other jurisdiction has to go through all the hoops to get the courthouse filled with reasonable arbiters of the facts and the law,\" Musso said. \"And when it does, it has to appeal to a Senate that has no representation.\"",
      "Some senators in neighboring states have taken up the cause. In the last Congress, Sen. Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, and senators from Virginia and Maryland introduced legislation that would streamline the nomination and confirmation process for D.C. judicial picks. But the Senate didn't act on the plan, and Carper retired last year.",
      "Carper told CBS News in an interview before his term ended that \"the way we treat the District of Columbia, especially with respect to selection of the judges, is, I think, shameful.\"",
      "\"We basically say, you know, 'You can come up with all the names within the district of who you think ought to be a judge, and we'll take our good old time to figure out if we're ever going to confirm some of these judges,'\" Carper said.",
      "That approach by the Senate has led to concerns that its delays in confirming D.C. judicial nominees is damaging the public's trust in the judicial system.",
      "\"The issue is that there's just this divide where the people who do have control over the process don't understand the impact that the delay in confirmations is having on D.C. families. And then the D.C. families don't understand how the process is working,\" Gibbs said. \"In their eyes, the delay is the problem of the court. Families begin to view the court as a broken system that doesn't meet the commitment that it has to the public, which is to administer justice in a way that is efficient, that is fair, that allows families to have the opportunity to be heard before the court.\"",
      "The Republican-controlled House has begun to take legislative steps related to the D.C. courts, and it has moved swiftly to exert its control over the district. GOP Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas introduced legislation earlier this month that would dismantle the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission, and the House approved it in a party-line vote last week. It's unclear whether it would garner the 60 votes needed in the Senate to advance.",
      "In a letter to Congress, the members of the commission said D.C.'s judicial nomination process is \"one of the best nonpartisan processes\" in the nation and noted that Mr. Trump engaged in it during his first term and earlier this month with his nominations.",
      "\"The Commission process has been effective for over 50 years, working with both Republican and Democratic administrations,\" members wrote in a Sept. 9 letter. \"Our process is carefully designed to ensure that the over 700,000 residents of our city have a voice in judicial appointments, while also respecting the President's authority in nominating individuals for the critical role of judicial service in the District of Columbia.\"",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday he was surprised by President Trump's post arguing the Eastern European country could regain all of its territory captured by Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that Zelenskyy's forces are \"in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form\" with Europe's help.\u00a0 The unexpected remarks \u2014 which called the Russian military a \"paper tiger\" \u2014 came after Mr. Trump met with Zelenskyy for about an hour Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.",
      "The comments appear to mark a dramatic shift for Mr. Trump, who said last month he expected \"some swapping of territories\" as part of an eventual Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal. Russia occupies large parts of eastern Ukraine, including territories captured in 2014 and in the current war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Asked later Tuesday by Fox News' Bret Baier if he was surprised by the U.S. president's about-face, Zelenskyy laughed and responded, \"a little bit.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said he and Mr. Trump had a positive conversation on Tuesday, and he believes Mr. Trump's position on territorial swaps has changed.",
      "\"I think he understands for today that we can't just swap territories. It's not fair,\" he said.",
      "During their meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that Zelenskyy was \"putting up one hell of a fight,\" and he believes the \"biggest progress\" is that the Russian economy is \"terrible.\" But the U.S. leader didn't appear optimistic about a quick resolution to the war, telling reporters, \"It looks like it's not going to end for a long time.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire deal to end their more than three-year-long war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "But a deal has remained elusive as both sides' public positions remain far apart. The Kremlin has pushed Zelenskyy to fully withdraw from large swaths of eastern Ukraine, an idea Zelenskyy has rejected as unfair and unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Ukraine has sought international security guarantees to deter another Russian attack if the current conflict ends.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin at various points. He met with Putin in Alaska last month, but he has criticized the Russian leader for continued strikes on Ukraine, and said last week that Putin had \"really let me down.\"",
      "The U.S. president also pressed NATO countries earlier this month to stop buying Russian oil and to impose hefty tariffs on China, which has remained aligned with Russia, writing that those moves could \"be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.\"",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he believes NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace, after Russian drones entered Poland earlier this month and Russian fighter jets allegedly entered Estonian airspace.",
      "At other points, though, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy have had a rocky relationship. An Oval Office meeting between the two leaders earlier this year descended into a shouting match, and Mr. Trump has occasionally blamed Zelenskyy for the war.",
      "During his interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he believes his relationship with his American counterpart has improved.",
      "\"I think we have better relation[s] than before,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I think we didn't have close relation[s] because we didn't have, maybe, time. I don't know.\"",

In total, law enforcement discovered 300 SIM servers \u2013 over 100,000 SIM cards \u2013 enabling encrypted, anonymous communication and capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. Officials say the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch.",
      "\"This network had the potential to disable cell phone towers and essentially shut down the cellular network in New York City,\" U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool said in a video released by the agency.",
      "An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that this week, the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes,\" later adding, \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "Telephonic threats to multiple senior U.S. officials this past spring \u2013 including multiple people protected by the Secret Service \u2013 first triggered the investigation, but officials say the network was seized within the last three weeks.",
      "\"We cannot share which officials were targeted out of concerns for their privacy, but as the forensics investigation continues, we do expect that we will find more targeted officials once we get through that data,\" McCool said.",
      "Early analysis shows the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement, including members of known organized crime gangs, drug cartels and human trafficking rings, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. The U.S. Secret Service says it is combing through the more than 100,000 SIM cards in an ongoing, exhaustive forensic analysis.",
      "\"Each SIM basically has the equivalent data of a cell phone. So we're working through every call, every text, every search made on those SIM cards,\" an official told CBS News, adding, \"Early analysis indicates that this network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement here in the U.S.\"",
      "The equipment was found within 35 miles of the United Nations in New York, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. Investigators also found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, plus computers and phones.",
      "\"This isn't a group of people in a basement playing a video game and trying to play a prank,\" one official said. \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "\"The timing, the location, the proximity of this network had the potential to impact the U.N. and that was clear and something that we had to consider,\" added McCool.",
      "The investigation was launched by a new division within the U.S. Secret Service established by Director Sean Curran and dubbed the \"Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit,\" in conjunction with Homeland Security Investigations.",
      "\"These devices no longer pose any threat to New York,\" an official said. \"We've taken care of and dismantled that threat\u2026There is currently no credible threat against the UN.\"",
      "Still, another official added that \"it would be unwise to assume\" there aren't other such networks in the U.S.",
      "The investigation remains ongoing, according to the U.S. Secret Service. There have been no arrests yet, but officials said, \"there could be arrests down the road,\" adding that \"from an operational perspective, we want those behind the network to know that the Secret Service is aware and that we're kind of coming for them.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rfk-jr-distort-facts-autism-tylenol-vaccines/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 19:48:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The White House's autism announcement exaggerates links to Tylenol, misleads on vaccines, and sets back the field by ignoring decades of research, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Ann Bauer, a researcher who studies Tylenol and autism, felt queasy with anxiety in the weeks leading up to the White House's much-anticipated autism announcement.",
      "In August, Bauer and her colleagues published an analysis of 46 previous studies on Tylenol, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Many found no link between the drug and the conditions, while some suggested Tylenol might occasionally exacerbate other potential causes of autism, such as genetics.",
      "Bauer, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, and her team called for more judicious use of the drug until the science is settled.",
      "On Monday, President Trump stood beside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what he called a \"historic\" announcement on autism. \"If you're pregnant, don't take Tylenol, and don't give it to the baby after the baby is born,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines and don't take any pills that have no autism,\" he added, without providing evidence. \"They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it's a disgrace.\"",
      "A fact sheet released alongside the White House briefing cited Bauer's analysis. But she was alarmed by Mr. Trump's comments. If prenatal Tylenol has any association, which it may not, it would help account for only a fraction of cases, she said. Further, research has not deeply examined Tylenol risks in young children, and many rigorous studies refute a link between vaccines and autism.",
      "Bauer worries such statements will cut both ways: People may put themselves at risk to avoid vaccines and Tylenol, the only safe painkiller for use during pregnancy. And she frets that scientists might outright reject her team's measured concerns about Tylenol in a backlash against misleading remarks from Mr. Trump and other members of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement.",
      "\"I'm really concerned about how this message is going to play out,\" she said. \"It's a sound-bite universe, and everyone wants a simple solution.\"",
      "Autism experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were neither consulted for the White House's long-awaited autism announcement nor asked to review a draft of the findings and recommendations, CDC scientists told KFF Health News, which agreed not to identify them because they fear retaliation.",
      "\"Typically, we'd be asked to provide information and review the report for accuracy, but we've had absolutely no contact with anyone,\" one CDC researcher said. \"It is very unusual.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Kennedy promised this year that under their leadership the federal government would swiftly figure out what causes autism. Scientists who work in the field have been skeptical, noting that decades of research has shown that no single drug, chemical, or other environmental factor is strongly linked to the developmental disorder. In addition, both Mr. Trump and Kennedy have repeated the scientifically debunked notion that childhood vaccines may cause autism.",
      "Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence at Boston University, called Mr. Trump's comments dangerous. Fevers can harm the mother and the developing fetus, she said, adding that fevers are more strongly associated with autism than Tylenol.",
      "In an emailed response to queries, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, \"We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America's unprecedented rise in autism rates.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote, \"President Trump pledged to address America's rising rate of autism, and to do so with Gold Standard Science.\"",
      "Had CDC scientists been allowed to brief Kennedy, they say they would have cautioned that simple fixes won't make a dent in the number of autism cases in the United States: As many as 1 in 31 8-year-old children had autism spectrum disorder in 2022.",
      "Systemic changes, such as regulations on air pollution, which has been linked to asthma and developmental disabilities including autism, and assistance for parents of disabled children, could improve lives for far more Americans with autism and other conditions than actions taken by the Trump administration on Sept. 22, researchers say.",
      "One federal action is to consider updating the label on Tylenol and to \"encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.\" The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already recommends acetaminophen \"as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.\"",
      "\"Political crusade\"",
      "Despite Kennedy's many years of speaking about autism, he rarely cites credible autism research or expert recommendations, Tager-Flusberg said. Instead, Kennedy repeats fringe, scientifically debunked theories linking vaccines to autism, despite rigorous studies published in peer-reviewed journals that refute a link.",
      "At the Sept. 22 briefing, Mr. Trump said he spoke with Kennedy about autism 20 years ago: \"We understood a lot more than a lot of people who studied it,\" he said. Ahead of Mr. Trump's first term in 2017, Kennedy said he met with the president to consider a commission on vaccine safety and autism. It didn't happen then. But soon after Kennedy was confirmed as health secretary, he called autism \"preventable,\" pointed to \"environmental toxins,\" and contradicted the results of a CDC study finding that the main driver of rising autism diagnoses was that doctors increasingly recognize the disorder.",
      "At a televised Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Mr. Trump, \"By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures.\"",
      "\"You stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it's a shot,\" Mr. Trump replied.",
      "\"He is on a political crusade,\" Tager-Flusberg said of Kennedy, adding that vaccines, Tylenol, aluminum, and food dyes make for simple targets to rally against. \"We know genetics is the most significant risk factor,\" she said, \"but you can't blame Big Pharma for genetics, and you can't build a political movement on genetics research and ride to victory.\"",
      "\"RFK makes our work harder,\" said Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher and the author of a book about his autistic daughter, \"Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism.\" He said the book stemmed from conversations with Kennedy in 2017, in which Hotez shared studies pinpointing more than a hundred genes linked to autism, and research into the complex interplay between genetics, biological processes, and things that children and fetuses encounter during development.",
      "\"I sat down with him and explained what the science says, but he was unwilling or incapable of thinking deeply about it,\" Hotez said. \"He is extremely careless.\"",
      "In addition to its focus on Tylenol, the White House said it would move to update \"prescribing information\" on leucovorin \u2014 a medication related to the B vitamin folate \u2014 to reflect its use as an autism treatment. A small clinical trial in 2012-13 suggested the drug may help treat language problems in some children with autism. Tager-Flusberg said the findings warrant further study but clarified these were \"old data, not a breakthrough.\"",
      "Likewise, studies finding a modest association between autism and prolonged Tylenol use were published years ago. Researchers have suggested the medicine might occasionally exacerbate factors associated with autism, such as genetics and oxidative stress, a biological condition that occurs for a variety of reasons that scientists are still unraveling.",
      "Still, these studies couldn't rule out the possibility that fevers prompting women to take Tylenol, rather than the medicine itself, might instead be to blame. Fevers and infections \u2014 including those prevented by vaccines \u2014 have also been linked to autism.",
      "Nonetheless, Bauer's recommendation would be to pause before taking acetaminophen while pregnant \u2014 blanket advice that doctors give for all medications during that period, but which may be ignored. \"Try to alleviate discomfort in some other ways, like with a cold compress, hydration, or massage, before taking it,\" Bauer said.",
      "She welcomed the White House's motion to consider labeling Tylenol to emphasize judicious use of the drug but worries about how the MAHA movement might distort a careful message. On Sept. 2, the right-wing news outlet One America News Network posted an interview with newly appointed CDC vaccine adviser Robert Malone, writing that Malone \"speculates RFK Jr. may have an important announcement this month regarding a potential link between Tylenol, multiple vaccinations and autism in children.\"",
      "\"I was sick to my stomach,\" Bauer said, concerned that Kennedy would link her study to discredited theories, causing doctors and scientists to reject her far more measured work.",
      "\"The boy who cried wolf\"",
      "Several medical and scientific associations have called for Kennedy's removal or resignation. Many scientists are skeptical of what he says because much of it has been misleading or wrong. For example, he's said HIV isn't the only cause of AIDS (it is), that antidepressant drugs cause mass shootings (they don't), that older adults don't have severe autism (some do), that the measles vaccine causes brain swelling (it doesn't), that COVID vaccines were the deadliest vaccines ever made (they aren't), that vaccines aren't safety-tested (they are), and that vaccines contribute to autism (they don't).",
      "\"This is like the boy who cried wolf,\" said Brian Lee, an epidemiologist at Drexel University. \"One day he might be right about something and Americans who are not prone to conspiracies won't trust it because it's coming from RFK's mouth. And that could be a problem.\"",
      "What's more, the Trump administration is eroding scientists' ability to probe the safety of pharmaceuticals, said Robert Steinbrook, head of health research at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer protection group.",
      "\"Public Citizen is very supportive of research on medications that could be linked to diseases,\" he said. \"But it needs to be through an open process, which looks at scientific evidence, and which doesn't cherry-pick studies to support a preconceived point of view.\"",
      "Steinbrook said the administration has undermined his confidence in the government's ability to conduct credible work. The Food and Drug Administration has held less than a third the number of advisory committee meetings this year as it did last, meaning fewer opportunities for experts to discuss research on the risks and benefits of drugs. The Trump administration has fired hundreds of career scientists at the CDC and FDA and cut millions of dollars in research funds, including to projects studying autism.",
      "In early September, the CDC issued an unusual contract with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to analyze datasets for signs that vaccinated children were more likely to have autism. Unlike with other research initiatives, the CDC didn't post an open call for applications in advance. This allows agency experts to review proposals and select studies best designed to answer the question at hand.",
      "CDC researchers told KFF Health News that experts in the agency's autism and disability group weren't aware of the contract or asked to review the proposal. That's important, they said, because researchers digging through data to find clues about autism must show how they'll rule out biological and environmental exposures that muddy the results, and ensure that children have been accurately diagnosed. One researcher said, \"It absolutely looks like Kennedy has subverted the grantmaking process.\"",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to KFF Health News' requests for information on the grant, including through a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "The new vaccine study is separate from Kennedy's autism data-science initiative, which was posted as an open call at the National Institutes of Health. \"The hope is that something good comes of it, and that the government won't cherry-pick or censor what scientists find out,\" Lee said.",
      "Bauer said she didn't apply to be part of the initiative because of Kennedy's outsize presence at HHS.",
      "\"I would not take his funding because it could take away from the credibility of my study,\" she said, \"in the same way that taking money from pharmaceutical companies does.\"",

      "Routh represented himself in the trial. He was found guilty of all five charges, which included attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer.",
      "Routh was arrested in September 2024 at Mr. Trump's golf course. A Secret Service agent testified last week that he spotted Routh before the then-presidential candidate came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot, the agent said.",
      "After the verdict was read, Routh apparently tried to harm himself, possibly using a pen that was on his desk, to stab himself in the neck. His daughter cried out during the incident and U.S. marshals eventually tackled him.",
      "It was the second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in 2024, after shots were fired in a separate incident at a Pennsylvania rally. A bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear in that incident.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the guilty verdict against Routh \"illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence,\" and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the verdict sends \"a clear message\" that an \"attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate is an attack on our Republic and on the rights of every citizen.\"",
      "A federal district judge will determine his sentence. He faces life in prison.",
      "In a nearly hourlong closing argument on Tuesday, Routh said that there was no intent to kill because the trigger was never pulled, the gun was never fired and that no one was hurt, so \"no crime.\"",
      "\"I wanted to kill, my actions within the community and toward my co-workers and family should show my obvious non-violence and gentleness,\" Routh said. Speaking about himself in the third person, he said the shooting was never going to happen because it was \"never in his heart.\"",
      "But prosecutors said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Mr. Trump, who was then running for president. Prosecutors laid out Routh's actions ahead of the incident, saying \"those aren'tcoincidences \u2026 that's a plan,\" prosecutor Christopher Brown said in his closing argument.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Tuesday that he won't meet with Democratic leaders in Congress until they \"become realistic\" with their demands in the ongoing fight over funding the government, with a deadline of Oct. 1 quickly approaching.",
      "Early Tuesday morning, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries confirmed that a meeting was set to take place this week in the Oval Office. But in a\u00a0post\u00a0on Truth Social soon after, the president called off the gathering, at least for now.",
      "\"After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Last week, the House approved a measure to keep the government funded until Nov. 21, along with funds for additional security for lawmakers and other officials in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. Democrats put forward their own proposal, which would extend government funding until Oct. 31 and boost security funding. The Democrats' proposal also includes a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, and a clawback of the some of the policies put in place by Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year.",
      "Both proposals fell short in the Senate last Friday, raising fears that government funding will lapse at the end of the month.",
      "Congress is now in recess until next week, when the Senate will return with just days to act. House GOP leaders extended the lower chamber's break past the Oct. 1 deadline to pressure the Senate to adopt their bill.",
      "Meanwhile, Schumer and Jeffries have repeatedly asked GOP leaders to negotiate with them on a short-term funding extension. In a letter to Mr. Trump over the weekend, Schumer and Jeffries demanded a meeting with the president, saying Democrats would not support a \"dirty spending bill\" that does not address their health care priorities. Earlier Tuesday, the Democrats announced that following \"weeks of Republican stonewalling in Congress, President Trump has agreed to meet this week in the Oval Office.\"",
      "In his Truth Social post, the president railed against the Democratic proposal to extend government funding, which would roll back cuts to Medicaid, and restore funding for public radio and TV stations that was cut earlier this year in a rescissions package. He said \"I look forward to meeting with them if they get serious about the future of our Nation.\"",
      "\"To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for,\" he said. \"DO THE RIGHT THING!\"",
      "In a post on X in response, Jeffries said \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump just cancelled a high stakes meeting in the Oval Office with myself and Leader Schumer,\" Jeffries said. \"The extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America.\"",
      "Schumer also chimed in, telling the president, \"When you're finished ranting, we can sit down and discuss health care.\"",
      "\"Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job.

    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 20:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration announced it believes acetaminophen is linked to autism risk, but the maker of Tylenol and medical experts have strongly pushed back on the claims.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced the Food and Drug Administration believes the use of acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications \u2014 during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism, though medical experts have said the medication is safe.",
      "\"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,\" the president said. \"So, taking Tylenol is not good, alright? I'll say it. It's not good. For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.\"",
      "\"Ideally, a woman won't take Tylenol,\" he said, and pivoted to discussion of childhood vaccination, saying vaccines should be given in \"smaller doses\" and spread out \"over a period of years,\" without citing medical evidence for his claims about vaccines. On his various vaccine recommendations, the president said, \"You know, I'm just making these statements from me, I'm not making them from these doctors.\"",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the FDA based its decision on acetaminophen on \"clinical and laboratory studies\" that \"suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,\" including one study in the public health journal Environmental Health, but added that \"NIH [National Institutes of Health] research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses.\"",
      "However, in a major study published last year, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "After Mr. Trump's announcement, the FDA shared an open letter encouraging physicians to \"consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers\" \u2014 though the agency was more cautious than some of the president's statements.",
      "\"To be clear, while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,\" the letter states, calling the issue an \"ongoing area of scientific debate.\"",
      "The letter also stated physicians should balance the possible risks of acetaminophen with the fact that it is still safer than other over-the-counter painkillers and fever-reducing drugs during pregnancy, like aspirin and ibuprofen.",
      "The announcement comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS would undertake a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said later that month it could be as long as a year before the findings are released.",
      "\"To meet the president's challenge, I ordered HHS to launch unprecedented, all-agency effort to identify all causes of autism, including toxic and pharmaceutical exposures,\" Kennedy said.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary also announced the FDA would begin the process of approving the drug leucovorin to treat autism in children. It has previously been used off-label for that purpose.",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why. Most experts say it is likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in the way the condition is diagnosed.",
      "Tylenol maker responds to autism claims",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said \"independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.\"",
      "\"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise,\" the statement continues, highlighting what the company says is the greater health risk for expecting mothers from other conditions if they give up on taking the drug. \"Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\"",
      "\"The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,\" the company said, adding that it \"will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"",
      "Medical experts on acetaminophen and autism research",
      "In a statement to CBS News when reports of the administration's plans first surfaced, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said, \"There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",
      "Following the administration's announcement Monday, ACOG President Dr. Steven J. Fleischman said in a statement: \"Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy.\"",
      "\"Today's announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,\" Fleischman said. \"It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.\"",
      "\"The best evidence does not show an association between Tylenol and autism,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"The medical community, the scientific community has the same consensus, which is that Tylenol, acetaminophen, is safe in pregnancy.\"",
      "Gounder said acetaminophen is considered the safest option for treating issues like pain and high fever during pregnancy.",
      "\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" Gounder explained, adding she's worried that expectant mothers may turn to other options that would be less safe.",
      "\"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby,\" she said.",
      "While some previous research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have found no connection.",
      "\"Any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science and is premature given the current science,\" the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",
      "\"Scientific and medical authorities around the world recognize acetaminophen as the only analgesic considered safe for use during pregnancy when used according to the Drug Facts label, which specifically reminds pregnant women to always consult their healthcare provider before use,\" the group said.",
      "What is leucovorin?",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said autism \"may also be due to an autoimmune reaction to a folate receptor on the brain not allowing that important vitamin to get into the brain cells.\"",
      "He announced FDA will approve the drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid (also known as folate or vitamin B9), to treat autism in children. Leucovorin is an inexpensive, generic drug that was previously approved to ease the side effects of cancer chemotherapy.",
      "Pregnant women are prescribed multivitamins with folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. The neural tube develops into the brain and spinal cord.",
      "Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"You can have a perfectly normal folate level in your blood, but it may not be getting into the brain, and so there's a defect in the transport of folate into the brain. Leucovorin works around that,\" Gounder explained. \"Not all children with autism have this defect, so there's a test you can do to assess whether that's what's at play. For those kids, leucovorin has been shown to help, particularly with speech, getting kids to be more verbal than they were before.\"",
      "Leucovorin isn't a cure for autism, but \"it could really have a substantial impact on a very good percentage of children with autism,\" Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, told CBS News earlier this year.",

      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",
      "\"All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,\" he said.",

      "Among the new astronaut candidates is 39-year-old Anna Menon, a mother of two who flew to orbit in 2024 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon as a private astronaut on a commercial, non-NASA flight.",
      "\"I am so thrilled to be back here with the NASA family,\" Menon said. \"As more and more people venture into space ... we have this awesome opportunity to learn a tremendous amount to help support those astronauts ... and help keep them healthy and safe. So it's an exciting time to be here.\"",
      "Menon worked for NASA for seven years as a biomedical researcher and flight controller before joining SpaceX in 2018. She served as a senior engineer and was later selected as the onboard medical officer during the commercial Polaris Dawn\u00a0mission, chartered by billionaire Jared Isaacman.",
      "She married her husband, Anil, in 2016 while both were working for NASA. A former Air Force flight surgeon, Anil Menon joined SpaceX as its first medical officer in 2018. He joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2021 and is now assigned to a long-duration space station crew scheduled for launch aboard a Russian Soyuz next summer.",

      "In the largest seizure of its kind, the U.S. Secret Service announced Tuesday that the agency found active SIM farms at abandoned apartment buildings located at more than five sites. In total, law enforcement discovered 300 SIM servers \u2013 over 100,000 SIM cards \u2013 enabling encrypted, anonymous communication and capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. Officials say the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch.",
      "\"This network had the potential to disable cell phone towers and essentially shut down the cellular network in New York City,\" U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool said in a video released by the agency.",
      "An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that this week, the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes,\" later adding, \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "Telephonic threats to multiple senior U.S. officials this past spring \u2013 including multiple people protected by the Secret Service \u2013 first triggered the investigation, but officials say the network was seized within the last three weeks.",
      "\"We cannot share which officials were targeted out of concerns for their privacy, but as the forensics investigation continues, we do expect that we will find more targeted officials once we get through that data,\" McCool said.",
      "Early analysis shows the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement, including members of known organized crime gangs, drug cartels and human trafficking rings, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. The U.S. Secret Service says it is combing through the more than 100,000 SIM cards in an ongoing, exhaustive forensic analysis.",
      "\"Each SIM basically has the equivalent data of a cell phone. So we're working through every call, every text, every search made on those SIM cards,\" an official told CBS News, adding, \"Early analysis indicates that this network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement here in the U.S.\"",
      "The equipment was found within 35 miles of the United Nations in New York, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. Investigators also found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, plus computers and phones.",
      "\"This isn't a group of people in a basement playing a video game and trying to play a prank,\" one official said. \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "\"The timing, the location, the proximity of this network had the potential to impact the U.N. and that was clear and something that we had to consider,\" added McCool.",
      "The investigation was launched by a new division within the U.S. Secret Service established by Director Sean Curran and dubbed the \"Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit,\" in conjunction with Homeland Security Investigations.",
      "\"These devices no longer pose any threat to New York,\" an official said. \"We've taken care of and dismantled that threat\u2026There is currently no credible threat against the UN.\"",
      "Still, another official added that \"it would be unwise to assume\" there aren't other such networks in the U.S.",
      "The investigation remains ongoing, according to the U.S. Secret Service. There have been no arrests yet, but officials said, \"there could be arrests down the road,\" adding that \"from an operational perspective, we want those behind the network to know that the Secret Service is aware and that we're kind of coming for them.\"",

Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter \u2014 signaled by tapping their helmet or cap \u2014 and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.",
      "Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.",

The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that year's Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "In 2019, Fred DeJesus became the first umpire in a regular-season game to use ABS. He remembers the first pitch he tested \u2013 it was a strike \u2013 and how he was hesitant about the new technology at first.",

      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.",
      "At Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.",
      "ABS was used in this year's All-Star Game as well and has generally received positive reviews, CBS Sports reported. Four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna's calls were successful in July.",
      "Teams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. However, the proposal approved by the MLB on Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don't have challenges remaining.",
      "MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",
      "This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, restrictions on defensive shifts, pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts and larger bases.",
      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers. While there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, not everyone considers the skill a good thing.",
      "\"The idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that's not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension,\" former manager Bobby Valentine said.",

    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

      "The case, announced\u00a0by the Federal Trade Commission in 2023, centers on claims that Amazon engaged in what the agency said amounted to a \"years-long effort\" to trick millions of customers into automatically renewing their Prime subscriptions, specifically by using user-interface designs that were \"manipulative, coercive or deceptive.\"",
      "When it announced legal action against Amazon two years ago, the FTC said consumers who used Amazon to make purchases were presented with numerous options to subscribe to Prime, but that it was less clear how to buy an item without signing up for a membership. In some cases, the button for Amazon users to complete their purchase did not clearly indicate that they were also agreeing to enroll in Prime, according to regulators.",
      "The government's\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0also alleges that Amazon obfuscated the process to cancel a Prime subscription by forcing customers to jump through several hoops to end their membership.",
      "An FTC spokesperson declined to comment on the case.",
      "Amazon denies that its practices misled consumers. An Amazon spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch on Monday that \"neither Amazon nor the individual defendants did anything wrong.\"",
      "\"We remain confident that the facts will show these executives acted properly and we always put customers first,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Jury selection in the trial is scheduled to begin Monday, followed by opening arguments and possible witness testimony on Tuesday. The trial, which is being\u00a0held\u00a0at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, is expected to last up to four weeks. The outcome will be decided by a the jury.",

      "Despite being declared blind at 8 years old, Lakrout has taken on challenges, such as running the New York City Marathon and joining the U.S. National Paraclimbing Team. A new piece of technology \u2014 Meta's AI glasses \u2014 is her latest tool to help her stay savvy and adaptable on a daily basis.",
      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",
      "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the technology.",
      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",
      "The glasses, however, are work in progress says Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind.",
      "\"(They) work well for some things, doesn't work well in other situations,\" he said.",
      "Lakrout discovered this for herself. When she tried the glasses on in a restaurant, they read the menu to her perfectly but couldn't tell her the price for a specific item on second prompt. When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

      "The Trump administration has argued its policy doesn't violate the law. Also, months after the lawsuit was filed, the government told the court it had decided most of the FEMA disaster grants that the states were concerned about losing will not be tied to immigration cooperation after all. The administration called the lawsuit moot on those grounds.",
      "The states called the Trump administration's decision not to link disaster grants to immigration enforcement \"halfhearted and incomplete,\" arguing it's unclear if the decision was communicated to agency staff or if it will apply to years beyond 2025.",
      "In a 45-page ruling Wednesday, Smith sided with the states and granted summary judgment, calling the policy \"both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"Plaintiff States stand to suffer irreparable harm; the effect of the loss of emergency and disaster funds cannot be recovered later, and the downstream effect on disaster response and public safety are real and not compensable,\" Smith wrote.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James hailed the ruling in a statement, writing: \"The federal government cannot prioritize its cruel immigration agenda over Americans' safety. Today, the court affirmed that it is blatantly unconstitutional for DHS to hold life-saving disaster relief funds hostage to advance its anti-immigration efforts.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin asserted in a statement that cities and states that \"break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that,\" she wrote.",
      "The ruling follows a monthslong gambit by President Trump to punish \"sanctuary\" cities and states that limit cooperation between the police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "The Trump administration argues that those jurisdictions make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented immigrants, including accused criminals and people who are in state or local custody. But \"sanctuary\" cities and states typically argue that requiring them to cooperate with ICE would undermine trust in local police and make some immigrants wary of reporting crimes.",
      "Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order telling federal agencies to ensure that \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Since then, several agencies have moved to restrict grants to \"sanctuary\" cities and states, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Those moves have drawn lawsuits from Democratic cities and states. Last month, a San Francisco-based judge blocked the Trump administration from cutting off funding to almost three dozen cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Boston.",

      "As cranberry prices fall due to global competition and costs increase due to labor issues, higher utility costs and extreme weather, cranberry farmers like Rhodes are part of the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration's Cranberry Bog Program that pays farmers to turn unproductive bogs back into wetlands.",
      "The restoration project for the bogs owned by the Rhodes family is about 95% complete. It will be only a matter of time before native plants begin to return.",

      "For Massachusetts cranberry farmers, the program is one way to preserve their land as a generation of farmers nears retirement.",
      "\"They want to make sure that the land that they've tended to for so long is like, in good hands, whether that be a restoration program, or passing it on to the next generation,\" said Karen Cahill, deputy executive director of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association, a trade group which represents cranberry farmers in the state.",
      "Under the program, the farmers keep the land, but the public can enjoy it too. An example of a restoration process that worked was the Eel River headwaters in Plymouth in 2010, where 60 acres of former bogs are now beautiful wetlands, filtering water, storing carbon and providing storm resilience. They are also open for hiking and wildlife.",
      "Beth Lambert helps oversee the state's restoration program, including the projects at Eel River and Carver.",
      "\"Many of the cranberry farms in Massachusetts were constructed on wetlands,\" Lambert said. \"And what we're doing is, we're restoring those underlying drivers of water, the soil, and then we let Mother Nature take it from there.\"",

      "The bracket for Fat Bear Week 2025 has been revealed, and 12 bears at Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska are looking for votes from all over the world \u2014 but only one will be crowned the champion of the fat bears.",
      "For more than a decade, the Fat Bear Week contest has been highlighting some of the largest brown bears on the planet living along\u00a0Brooks River\u00a0inside the national park as they prepare for hibernation. The annual vote for fattest bear of the year begins Tuesday, Sept. 23, and will continue through Sept. 30. People can vote online between 12 and 9 p.m. ET each day.",
      "Bear lovers can also watch the fattened animals in their natural habitats in a series of livestreams on Explore.org, a multimedia organization that partners with the National Park Service to host the bear competition.",
      "What is Fat Bear Week?",
      "Fat Bear Week began in 2014 as a one-day event, Sarah Bruce, a park ranger at Katmai National Park and Preserve, told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a really great way to kind of showcase these bears that we have in southwest Alaska,\" Bruce said. \"It's very difficult to get to, so the cameras and Fat Bear Week make this park more accessible for folks who are unable to visit.\"",
      "It was started by\u00a0Explore.org\u00a0resident naturalist and former park ranger Mike Fitz, who saw the size difference in the park's bears from late June to July \u2014 when they are most active along the river \u2014 compared to later in September.",
      "How fat do the bears get?",
      "Scientists have estimated that the bears can pack on as much as 700 pounds as they get ready to hibernate for the winter, Bruce said. That means the bears can end up weighing more than 1,400 pounds.",
      "\"They get super fat, and it's really important to get fat. A fat bear is a healthy bear,\" she explained. \"So they're eating about a year's worth of food within the span of five to six months. When they go into hibernation, they're not eating anymore, so they survive on their fat stores.\"",
      "And what does the winner of Fat Bear Week get?",
      "\"Their prize is winning and surviving another winter season, which is the most difficult season for these bears,\" Bruce said.",
      "Meet the 2025 Fat Bear Week contenders",
      "Fat Bear Week contenders were announced during a livestream on Monday without issue, after last year's bracket reveal was\u00a0postponed following a skirmish between two Alaskan grizzlies that led to the death of one of the animals.",
      "While around 80 bears frequent the Brooks River during their active season, 12 bears are chosen for Fat Bear Week because of certain criteria, including whether there are before and after photographs of the bears, park ranger and photographer Ashleigh Monaco said Monday.",

      "These are the bears vying to be this year's champion:",
      "Fat Bear Jr. winner 128 Jr., or \"Biggie,\" is the offspring of 128. The dark fur bear is about 1 1/2 years old. She had a sibling who was unable to survive last summer, according to Monaco.",
      "\"While it is tragic that that cub didn't survive, it just goes to show 128's strength and resiliency in overcoming the challenges of living on the Brooks River herself,\" Monaco said.",
      "Going against 128 Jr. in the bracket's first quadrant is 5-year-old 609, the daughter of 909 and the champion of Fat Bear Jr. 2022. She has noticeably large round ears and a long nose.",
      "Either 128 Jr. or 609 will face off against 602, a newbie to the competition.",
      "He loves lounging and taking long naps by the river, Monaco said, and he dominated the category of size and strength this summer. Nicknamed \"Flow-tato,\" 602 is often spotted doing \"a little stomping dance,\" possibly a response to high adrenaline or excitement.",
      "In the bracket's second quadrant is 503. The 12-year-old is resourceful, playful and tolerant, allowing the younger bears to sometimes take his leftovers.",
      "This 7-year-old bear has \"never been fatter,\" said Naomi Boak, a media ranger at Katmai. In 2023, 901 had three cubs, but none of them survived.",
      "\"But she's back, and she's big,\" Boak said, adding that cubs could be in her future next season.",
      "Either 503 or 901 will have to face 32 Chunk, the runner-up of last year's Fat Bear Week. He was among the most dominant bears last year, but this year he is healing from a broken jaw, possibly from an altercation with another male over a female, according to Boak.",
      "\"That's a typical injury, and it's not an easy injury to live with, but he has powered through his injury,\" Boak said. \"He is fishing and he is getting fatter than ever.\"",
      "In the third quadrant is 26, a mother bear with twins \"with plenty of energy and spunk,\" said photographer Christine Loberg.",
      "This is the daughter of the 2018 Fat Bear Week champion, 409 Beadnose. 909 loves catching fish by the waterfall, simply catching them with her mouth.",
      "The mother of this year's Fat Bear Jr. champion is approximately 20 years old. Also known as Grazer, she stands out with her blond fur.",
      "Bear 99 is identifiable by his chocolate milk-color coat, according to Bruce. While he's still quite young, he has got enough fish this year to land him in the fat bear bracket.",

The man, Bratton Dean Wilkinson, allegedly said he had a bomb in his backpack. A bomb squad cleared the scene and the suspect was charged with false reporting to induce an emergency response.",
      "Officials have not identified the gunman in Wednesday's shooting, and have not said whether the August bomb threat was related. But Homeland Security officials have highlighted a spate of threats and attacks against federal facilities and personnel, including two other recent incidents in Texas.",

If convicted, each faces a mandatory sentence of 10 years to life in prison.",

The gunman, identified as 27-year-old Ryan Louis Mosqueda, had an assault rifle and was carrying a utility vest, officials said. Mosqueda died after Border Patrol agents and local police returned fire.",

According to court filings, 35-year-old Adrian Guerrero of Oakland, California, allegedly slashed the tire of a government vehicle and threatened to stab a law enforcement officer during a targeted law enforcement operation. He allegedly made repeated threats against law enforcement in San Francisco, warning, \"I'm going to f--- you up,\" and \"I'm going to go after your family,\" according to court papers.

      "In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" Carr told Johnson. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "ABC later said that it was \"indefinitely\" suspending the show.",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to preempt Kimmel's show.",
      "Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",
      "Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"monitor the show as it returns to ABC.\"",
      "Regarding Carr, Kimmel on Tuesday\u00a0showed\u00a0the audience a social media post that the FCC chair wrote in May 2022 in which he said, \"Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people in to the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.\"",
      "Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" calling his comments \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities \u2014 including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep \u2014 signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"",
      "Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform \"for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also speculated last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" the president told reporters on Sept. 18. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'\" Cruz said Friday on his podcast. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"",
      "Kimmel's show, which launched in 2003, tapes in front of a studio audience on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The guests for Tuesday's show included actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan.",

    "summary": "The family of one of the people killed when an airliner and an Army helicopter collided over Washington, D.C., in January has filed a lawsuit seeking accountability.",
    "story": [
      "The family of one of the 67 people killed earlier this year when an American Airlines plane and a United States Army helicopter collided over Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against the government and the airlines involved in the crash. It accuses them of failing to recognize the warning signs after more than 30 documented near misses in the area.",
      "At least 60 lawsuits from other families are expected to join this first lawsuit that seeks to hold the Federal Aviation Administration, the Army, American Airlines and its regional partner, PSA Airlines, accountable for the deadliest U.S. plane crash since 2001. PSA Airlines operated Flight 5342 that crashed on Jan. 29.",
      "The widow of Casey Crafton from Connecticut, who is raising three young boys without her husband, filed the lawsuit. Her lawyers also represent the majority of the families of people who died in the crash.",
      "\"Casey was a devoted father and husband, and we built a beautiful life together,\" Rachel Crafton said in a statement about the lawsuit, in which she described her husband as \"a loving brother, a supportive son, a committed employee, a selfless friend\" and someone who \"made everyone around him feel valued and respected.\"",
      "Casey Crafton's brother read his sister-in-law's statement aloud during a news conference Wednesday where her attorneys also spoke along with others who lost loved ones in the collision. As her husband had worked as an aviation mechanic, Rachel Crafton said he \"was betrayed by this system he trusted\" when Flight 5342 crashed.",
      "\"As his wife, I cannot stand by and allow his life to be lost in vain,\" her statement continued. \"Today, we are taking legal action because the accountability of American Airlines, PSA Airlines, and the Army and FAA is the only way to ensure this never happens again and no other family has to live with the pain we have to endure each day without Casey.\"",
      "Doug Lane, whose wife and child both died on Flight 5342, appeared at Wednesday's news conference, too.",
      "\"I, along with a number of other family members affected by this collision, are here to the deliver the message that the Crafton family are not on this journey alone,\" said Lane. He said families of the people killed have \"turned grief into action\" in the months since, prompting an investigation into the FAA and pushing for another into the Army.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the FAA said it would continue to work with the National Transportation Safety Board \"to ensure no family has to suffer this pain again.\"",
      "\"Our hearts go out to the families who lost loved ones on that tragic January evening. Since the accident, [Transportation] Secretary [Sean] Duffy and the FAA have acted decisively to make the skies over our nation's capital safer,\" the FAA said.",
      "The airlines and Army both said they are focused on supporting the families who lost loved ones in the crash and ensuring the safety of their flights. The Army declined to discuss the details of the lawsuit, but American and PSA defended their actions and said they will fight any claim that they caused or contributed to this accident.",
      "\"Flight 5342 was on a routine approach to DCA (Reagan airport) when the Army helicopter \u2014 that was above the published helicopter route altitude \u2014 collided with it,\" the airlines said in their statement. \"American has a strong track record of putting the safety of our customers and team members above everything else.\"",
      "Determining the cause of the crash",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has already highlighted a long list of things that likely contributed to the crash, although the final report identifying the cause won't be ready until next year.",
      "The Black Hawk helicopter was flying well above the 200-foot limit, but even if it had been at the correct altitude, the route it was flying provided a scant 75 feet of separation between helicopters and planes landing on Ronald Reagan International Airport's secondary runway. The helicopter's altimeter may have provided faulty readings.",
      "The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize an alarming pattern of near misses at the busy airport in the years before the crash and ignored concerns about helicopter traffic around the airport. Investigators also said that overworked controllers were trying to squeeze as many planes as possible into the landing pattern with minimal separation on a regular basis. If any of those things \u2014 or a number of other factors \u2014 had been different that night, the collision might have been avoided.",
      "The lawsuit says the airlines failed in their duty to protect the passengers because they were aware of the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport but failed to adequately train pilots to handle it and take other steps to mitigate the risks. Other airline policies, such as allowing pilots to accept an alternative runway that intersects with the helicopter route and heavily scheduling flights in the second half of every hour may have contributed.",
      "\"There is clear evidence that there were dozens of near-misses and thousands of reports of congestion between commercial aircraft and military aircraft at Reagan National that were being ignored by the airlines,\" said lawyer Bob Clifford, who is representing the families.",
      "The lawsuit says the PSA pilots should have reacted sooner when they received an alert about traffic in the area 19 seconds before the crash instead of waiting until the last second to pull up. The lawsuit says a yellow icon appeared on the pilots' warning system showing the relative direction and altitude of the Army helicopter.",
      "The PSA pilots would also have heard controllers warn the helicopter about their aircraft although the controller never warned the PSA pilots directly.",
      "\"A mission to make sure this doesn't happen again\"",
      "Among the jet's passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston, who were returning from an elite junior skaters' camp following the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas. A figure skating tribute event in Washington raised $1.2 million for the crash victims' families.",
      "Others on the flight from Wichita included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas; four members of a steamfitters' union in suburban Maryland; nine students and parents from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia; and two Chinese nationals. There were also four crew members on the plane and three people in the helicopter's crew who were killed.",
      "Bill and Renee Parente said they are hoping the lawsuit can answer the lingering questions about the crash that killed their 34-year-old son, Anthony Parente, less than six months before he was due to get married.",
      "Bill Parente said his family is mad because this crash didn't have to happen.",
      "\"We are on a mission to make sure this doesn't happen again,\" Bill Parente said after the news conference. \"We have to live with this for the rest of our lives.\"",

      "A former stylist for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 who testified against the disgraced music mogul in his federal criminal trial earlier this year \u2014 filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing Combs of sexual abuse and violence while he was in Combs' employ.",
      "The 37-page lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of Deonte Nash against Combs and Combs' label, Bad Boy Entertainment, also accuses Combs of sexual battery, human trafficking and false imprisonment.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Nash said he was hired to be Combs' stylist around 2008, at the age of 21, and worked for him until about 2018. Nash said that during that time period, he also worked as a stylist and creative director for Combs' then-girlfriend, R&B singer Cassandra Ventura, who also accused Combs of sexual abuse in a 2023 lawsuit and gave graphic testimony against him in his trial.",
      "\"Nash personally experienced sexual, physical, mental, and emotional abuse at the hands of Defendants during his ten-year employment,\" including \"forced tests of loyalty and manipulation, sexual harassment and sexual assaults, physical violence and manhandling, labor trafficking, threats of harm, and threats of death,\" the lawsuit against Combs reads.",

    "story": [
      "Retailers around the U.S. are expected to sharply reduce the number of workers they add for the holidays, a shift from their usual seasonal hiring sprees to help cope with the annual crush of customers.",
      "Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas attributes the weak demand for extra workers this year to companies bearing the heavier costs from U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, as well as on rising inflation and their growing reliance on technology to improve efficiency.",
      "The firm expects retail hiring fo the holidays to fall to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was emerging from a recession caused by the global financial crisis.",
      "\"Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,\" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The weaker seasonal hiring forecast comes as the U.S. job market is faltering. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of economists' expectations.",
      "Inflation has also edged up in recent months. The Consumer Price Index, which in March had sunk to an annual rate of 2.3%, in August\u00a0rose at a 2.9%\u00a0pace from a year ago.",
      "In the last quarter of 2024, retailers added just over 543,000 seasonal workers, down roughly 4% compared to 2023. Companies are projected to add fewer than 500,000 jobs during the last three months of 2025, according to Challenger. Such a figure would mark the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years.",
      "Challenger pointed to fewer seasonal hiring announcements than usual from retailers as a sign they plan to hire fewer workers for the holidays.",
      "\"While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less,\" Challenger said.",
      "Tariffs are causing some consumers to pull back on spending, recent data shows. An August survey\u00a0of consumers from the University of Michigan found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that see tariff-driven price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that rise substantially in price, according to the report.",
      "Tariffs have already driven up the cost of some categories of goods for U.S. consumers. For example, in August, audio equipment rose in price by 12% compared to one year earlier,\u00a0 while the cost of household goods rose 10%, the latest Consumer Price Index report\u00a0shows.",
      "\"A wave of uncertainty is impacting not just retailers, but also consumers heading into the final quarter of the year. With hiring slowing across the board, Retailers may hire fewer workers themselves, while many of their shoppers slow spending,\" Challenger added.",

Inspectors general are tasked with investigating wrongdoing and rooting out fraud and waste at government agency.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday is expected to sign\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S., according to a White House official.",
      "On Monday, a senior White House official said Mr. Trump would declare that the deal is a \"qualified divestiture\" and satisfies a law passed by Congress that requires TikTok's parent company to divest or face a ban. The declaration is expected to come in Mr. Trump's fifth executive order pushing back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in TikTok, according to the official. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "But there's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some could see the deal as not going far enough as it relates to TikTok's algorithm.",
      "As details on the deal trickled out from the administration last week, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China Committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Congress set clear legal safeguards for a deal, including precluding any cooperation with ByteDance or its affiliates on TikTok's recommendation algorithm, and prohibiting any ongoing operational relationship between a new TikTok and ByteDance,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"Based on initial reports, I am concerned the reported licensing deal may involve ongoing reliance by the new TikTok on a ByteDance algorithm and application that could allow continued CCP control or influence.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that global content will still be accessible for American users.",

      "A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands \u2014 including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports \u2014 out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, during which time it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be used for that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",
      "Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies' profits.",
      "Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing.",

      "Americans traveling to Europe will soon have their fingerprints scanned and picture taken when they arrive in countries like France, Italy and Spain under new regulations being rolled out across the continent starting next month. Those who don't provide such biometric data will be told au revoir, arrivederci or adi\u00f3s.",
      "The change comes as the European Union rolls out its new Entry/Exit System for not just Americans but all visitors from outside Europe's Schengen Area, a group of countries that allows people in the zone to travel across borders freely without going through customs checks.",

      "Early Tuesday morning, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries confirmed that a meeting was set to take place this week in the Oval Office. But in a\u00a0post\u00a0on Truth Social soon after, the president called off the gathering, at least for now.",
      "\"After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Last week, the House approved a measure to keep the government funded until Nov. 21, along with funds for additional security for lawmakers and other officials in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. Democrats put forward their own proposal, which would extend government funding until Oct. 31 and boost security funding. The Democrats' proposal also includes a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, and a clawback of the some of the policies put in place by Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year.",
      "Both proposals fell short in the Senate last Friday, raising fears that government funding will lapse at the end of the month.",
      "Congress is now in recess until next week, when the Senate will return with just days to act. House GOP leaders extended the lower chamber's break past the Oct. 1 deadline to pressure the Senate to adopt their bill.",
      "Meanwhile, Schumer and Jeffries have repeatedly asked GOP leaders to negotiate with them on a short-term funding extension. In a letter to Mr. Trump over the weekend, Schumer and Jeffries demanded a meeting with the president, saying Democrats would not support a \"dirty spending bill\" that does not address their health care priorities. Earlier Tuesday, the Democrats announced that following \"weeks of Republican stonewalling in Congress, President Trump has agreed to meet this week in the Oval Office.\"",
      "In his Truth Social post, the president railed against the Democratic proposal to extend government funding, which would roll back cuts to Medicaid, and restore funding for public radio and TV stations that was cut earlier this year in a rescissions package. He said \"I look forward to meeting with them if they get serious about the future of our Nation.\"",
      "\"To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for,\" he said. \"DO THE RIGHT THING!\"",
      "In a post on X in response, Jeffries said \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump just cancelled a high stakes meeting in the Oval Office with myself and Leader Schumer,\" Jeffries said. \"The extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America.\"",
      "Schumer also chimed in, telling the president, \"When you're finished ranting, we can sit down and discuss health care.\"",
      "\"Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job. Democrats are ready to work to avoid a shutdown\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Trump and Republicans are holding America hostage. Donald Trump will own the shutdown.\"",

      "Al-Sharaa, who has past ties to al Qaeda and the Islamic State, spoke with Margaret Brennan, on assignment in Syria for \"60 Minutes,\" ahead of his historic address to the United Nations in New York. Al-Sharaa took power after ousting former Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad following nearly 14 years of civil war. In December, the U.S. removed a $10 million bounty off al-Sharaa's head. In July, the U.S. lifted its terrorist designation of the rebel group he led.",
      "Al-Sharaa said Israel's recent attack on Hamas leaders who were in Qatar \u2014 a close U.S. ally \u2014 and its airstrikes on the grounds near Syria's presidential palace put \"the interests of the U.S. and its strategic allies at risk, pushing those allies to consider alternatives to America.\"",
      "\"Bombing the presidential palace amounts to nothing less than a declaration of war on Syria,\" he told Brennan. \"What if the backyard of the White House was bombed? The United States would wage war against whoever targeted the White House backyard for the next 20 years.\"",
      "Syria did not retaliate for those Israeli strikes. The U.S. launched a diplomatic effort led by U.S. special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack to help de-escalate tensions.",
      "\"There are borders and international standards that must be respected,\" he said. \"There are international laws, the United Nations and the Security Council that we turn to, to protect those standards. Otherwise, the world would fall into massive chaos.\"",
      "On Wednesday, al-Sharaa became the first Syrian head of state to speak at the U.N. General Assembly in nearly 60 years. In his speech, he spoke of the brutality endured by the Syrian people under the Assad regime and described what he called a \"historic opportunity to bring stability, peace, and prosperity to Syria and the entire region.\" He also warned of regional instability stemming from Israel's actions.",
      "In his nearly 10-minute speech, al-Sharaa told world leaders that Israeli policies and actions \"contradict\" the international community's support for Syria. He said Syria is committed to reaching a security agreement with Israel to lower tensions.",
      "The U.S. has been trying to broker an arrangement between Syria and Israel that is similar to a 1974 ceasefire agreement with the Assad regime. After the collapse of the Assad regime in December, Israel invaded territory in southern Syria and created what it calls a \"buffer zone\" beyond the lines of the 1974 agreement. Al-Sharaa wants Israel to return any lands seized since the Assad regime fell, and to have U.N. peacekeepers monitor the new agreement.",
      "An Israeli official declined to comment on al-Sharaa's remarks but confirmed that negotiations with Syria are continuing.",
      "Watch more of the interview this season on \"60 Minutes.\"",

      "Super Typhoon Ragasa pummeled Hong Kong on Wednesday morning with a ferocity not witnessed in the city for years. Ragasa brought hurricane-force winds, torrential rain and a storm surge that left a trail of destruction in densely populated Hong Kong.",
      "A river of sea water crashed through the lobby of a luxury hotel, sending people and glass flying.",

      "Hundreds of thousands of people had to be evacuated from low lying areas in southern China as what's been dubbed by local media the \"King of Storms\" lashed the coastline.",
      "A weather station in the town of Chuandao recorded a gust of about 150 mph on Wednesday afternoon, according to The Associated Press, setting a local record. At that strength the typhoon would likely be the equivalent of a strong\u00a0Category 3 or a Category 4 hurricane.",

    "summary": "Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who is on board one of the boats, called the strikes a \"scare tactic\" and implored the flotilla's supporters to stay focused on Gaza rather than on the activists.",
    "story": [
      "Activists taking part in a flotilla seeking to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza said Wednesday that some of their boats were attacked by drones overnight while sailing south of Greece.",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla said it was attacked during the night by \"unidentified drones and communications jamming.\" It said that \"at least 13 explosions\" were heard on and around several flotilla boats, while drones or aircraft dropped \"unidentified objects\" on at least 10 boats.",
      "No casualties were reported but there was damage to the vessels and \"widespread obstruction in communications,\" it added. Activists posted a brief video showing what appeared to be an explosion on or near one of the vessels.",
      "Greece's coast guard did not report any distress calls.",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions regarding the attack.",
      "The flotilla, which organizers say includes about 50 vessels and participants from dozens of countries, is carrying humanitarian aid, including food and medicine, for Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry has accused organizers of being linked to Hamas, an accusation organizers reject. Israel has proposed that the activists unload their aid in the Israeli port of Ashkelon for it to be transported into Gaza, saying it will not accept any breach of its blockade.",
      "Italy condemned the attack and activated a navy frigate to be on hand for possible rescue operations, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said. Crosetto said the Italian Navy's frigate Fasan, which was sailing north of Crete, was \"already heading towards the area for possible rescue operations.\" Italy has informed Israel about the decision.",
      "\"In a democracy, demonstrations and forms of protest must also be protected when they are carried out in accordance with international law and without resorting to violence,\" Crosetto said.",
      "Italy's Foreign Ministry meanwhile said its computer systems had been overwhelmed by a \"mail bombing\" campaign in which thousands of what it said were fake emails flooded its servers after the attack on the flotilla.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, the Global Sumud Flotilla had sent out an urgent appeal to its supporters asking them to email the ministry demanding it take a firm position to condemn the attack on the flotilla, protect the participants and put diplomatic pressure on those responsible.",
      "The emails \"had the effect of hindering the work\" of the ministry's crisis unit, which has been the main point of contact for Italian citizens aboard the flotilla, the foreign ministry said in a statement.",
      "Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told lawmakers earlier this month he had personally called Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to urge Israel to respect the rights of Italian activists participating in the flotilla.",
      "Tajani said at the time that 58 Italians were in the flotilla, including some lawmakers.",
      "The European Union also warned against any use of force.",
      "\"The freedom of navigation under international law must be upheld,\" said Eva Hrncirova, a European Commission spokesperson.",
      "UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan called for an investigation, saying \"attacks and threats against those trying to deliver aid to and support the hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza who are suffering famine and starvation defy belief.\"",
      "Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who is on board one of the boats, called the strikes a \"scare tactic\" and implored the flotilla's supporters to stay focused on Gaza rather than on the activists.",
      "\"We were aware of the risks of these kind of attacks and that's not something that's going to stop us,\" Thunberg said on a livestream. \"The most important thing isn't that we were hit by drones. Drones are something that Palestinians experience 24-7.\"",
      "Italian activist Simone Zambrin said drones \"have been flying over our heads for days now\" and on Wednesday \"dropped devices at our boats, damaging both the sails and the hearing of some of our crew members.\"",
      "She said Israel was trying \"to instill fear because it is afraid of our arrival.\"",
      "Greg Stoker, an American activist on board one of the boats, said in a social media post that the vessel's radio communications also suffered interference, with the jammers playing an ABBA song over the radio channel the flotilla was using.",
      "The flotilla has reported several attacks since it set sail from Spain on Sept. 1, including two while some of its boats were in Tunisian waters.",
      "Activists say it's the largest attempt to date to break the Israeli maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has now lasted 18 years, long predating the current war in Gaza. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms, while critics consider it collective punishment.",
      "The almost two-year war has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants, but says around half were women and children.",
      "The world's leading authority on hunger crises said last month that Israel's blockade and ongoing offensive had already pushed Gaza City into famine. More than 300,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks as Israel has ordered the population to move south, but an estimated 700,000 remain, according to U.N. agencies and aid groups.",
      "The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 others hostage. Israel says its operation in Gaza is aimed at pressuring Hamas to surrender and return the remaining 48 hostages, about 20 of whom Israel believes are still alive. Most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Activists have launched several flotillas aimed at breaking the blockade over the years, and nearly all of them intercepted by Israeli forces. The crew of another vessel said they were attacked by drones in May in international waters off Malta. An overland convoy traveling across North Africa also attempted to reach Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip, but was blocked by security forces aligned with Egypt in eastern Libya.",
      "In 2010, Israeli commandos raided the Mavi Marmara, a boat participating in an aid flotilla attempting to breach the maritime blockade of Gaza, killing 10 Turkish activists in clashes on board.",

    "summary": "Kremlin spokesman shoots back at Trump's suggestion that Russia is \"a paper tiger,\" declaring: \"There are no paper bears. And Russia is a real bear.\"",
    "story": [
      "Russia pushed back Wednesday at comments made by President Trump, who disparaged Moscow's military capabilities and economy and said Ukraine could potentially recapture all of the territory seized by Russian forces since President Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion over three years ago.",
      "It marked a dramatic shift in rhetoric for Mr. Trump, who has previously urged Ukraine to make concessions to end the conflict, but there was no indication that the president would also shift U.S. policy to offer more direct support for Kyiv.",
      "\"Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger,'\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday, shortly after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.",
      "\"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.\"",
      "\"President Trump heard about what is happening in Zelenskyy's version, and apparently, at that moment, this version became the reason for such an assessment,\" Peskov said in an interview with Russia's RBC radio Wednesday morning. \"We continue our special military operation in order to ensure our interests and achieve the goals that the supreme Commander-in-Chief Putin and the president of our country set in the very beginning.\"",
      "Peskov said Russia's \"premium markets\" were no longer in Europe, but in the East, and that the country was economically stable.",
      "\"Russia is associated with a bear. There are no paper bears. And Russia is a real bear\u2026 There is nothing paper here,\" Peskov said. \"Russia maintains macroeconomic stability. Yes, Russia is experiencing certain points of tension and problematic points in different sectors of the economy, which is inevitably connected with those myriads of economic restrictions, sanctions which we face, and so on, with the global economic disorder. This is not just sanctions. Let's not forget that the world has entered an absolutely unpredictable economic situation.\"",
      "Separately, in a briefing later on Wednesday, Peskov told journalists: \"The fact that they are trying in every way to encourage Ukraine to continue military operations, and the idea that Ukraine can recapture anything, is, in our view, a misguided proposition.\"",
      "Zelenskyy appeared Wednesday before the United Nations General Assembly, making a plea that \"we need to restore international cooperation for peace and security.\"",
      "\"People are still dying every week, yet there is no ceasefire, because Russia refuses,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "The U.S. is the most important contributor to NATO and the largest weapons supplier to Ukraine, but Mr. Trump wants America's European allies to take on more of the continent's defense burden - including supporting Ukraine. The president has, at times, echoed the Kremlin's narrative about the war, alarming NATO allies, and it was unclear whether U.S. policy on Ukraine would change after Mr. Trump's apparent rhetorical shift.",
      "\"He has acknowledged that the conflict is more complicated and he's clearly frustrated with Putin, so that I think it is perhaps a success for Ukrainian and European diplomacy that that explanation has got through,\" Neil Melvin, Director of International Security at the British think-tank RUSI, told the Reuters news agency. \"The narrative around what he is saying has shifted but he still seems to be making it about distancing the U.S. from leading on the conflict. He's putting it back onto Europe all the time.\"",
      "Melvin told Reuters that Mr. Trump's rhetoric could shift again.",
      "\"I think we are always just one call to Putin away from a shift, and that's why I think fundamentally the first eight months have eroded trust in Europe in the Trump administration's approach, and this doesn't restore trust,\" Melvin said.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's apparent shift on Ukraine, Peskov said the relationship between the U.S. and Russian leaders remained friendly.",
      "\"They have known each other for a very long time, and indeed they respect each other. They treat each other warmly,\" Peskov said. \"This does not prevent them from talking about sharp topics. It does not stop them from diverging on many issues. After all, each of them has his own interests.\"",

    "summary": "The Rijksmuseum museum said that it had finally sniffed out a sketch that inspired the dog in Rembrandt's iconic \"Night Watch\" painting.",
    "story": [
      "It didn't exactly take dogged detective work for an art sleuth in Amsterdam to solve a canine conundrum dating back to the Dutch Golden Age.",
      "Anne Lenders, a curator at the city's landmark Rijksmuseum, said Tuesday that it was more or less by accident that she discovered that the barking dog in\u00a0Rembrandt van Rijn's famous \"The Night Watch\" is a near-identical copy of one that features in a 1619 pen and ink drawing by fellow Dutch artist Adriaen van de Venne.",
      "\"I wasn't looking for this; it was really unexpected,\" Lenders said in the glass room where \"Night Watch\" is undergoing extensive restoration.",
      "She was visiting an exhibition at the Zeeuws Museum in the southern Netherlands when her eye fell on a picture of a dog by Van de Venne that was printed in a book by the poet Jacob Cats. The original drawing \u2014 which turned out to be part of the Rijksmuseum's own vast collection \u2014 was also on display.",
      "Using her phone to compare the two images side by side, the 39-year-old Dutchwoman saw \"striking similarities\" between van de Venne's dog and the canine depicted in Rembrandt's 1642 masterpiece.",
      "\"The resemblance is so strong that at the very first moment I thought he (Rembrandt) must have used this,\" she added.",
      "That's when the research started: a comparison of Van de Venne's and Rembrandt's dogs; their pose, even the collar they wear.",
      "\"The head turns in exact the same angle with the mouth slightly opened. ... Both dogs have long hair and ears that hang vertical,\" said Lenders.",
      "In the \"Night Watch,\" the dog adds tension to a dark corner of the crowded composition, crouching and apparently barking near a drummer called Jacob Jorisz and just behind one of the iconic 1642 painting's main characters, Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch.",
      "The discovery is the latest in a series of revelations to emerge during a yearslong project to reexamine the 379.5 by 453.5-centimeter (149.4 by 178.5-inch) canvas using modern techniques. \"Operation Night Watch\" began in 2019 with an extensive study of the painting and is continuing with restoration work that is likely to take years to complete.",
      "\"'The Night Watch' is Rembrandt's most famous painting and we always think that it was created out of nothing, out of his genius,\" Taco Dibbits, the director of the Rijksmuseum, told Agence France-Presse. \"But Rembrandt, like the great Italian masters Michelangelo and Raphael, used works of art by artists before him to make his own compositions.\"",
      "One thing the Rijksmuseum couldn't figure out was exactly what kind of dog it is, with expert opinions divided between a French or a Dutch breed. Most likely, the two artists used a little poetic license.",
      "\"We will never have a conclusion on which breed it is,\" Dibbits said. \"But it's definitely very much loved.\"",
      "While Dibbits credited \"well informed luck\" for the find, he said such discovery could only have happened with the help of \"Operation Night Watch,\" a large-scale public restoration project launched in 2019.",
      "\"You would say, well, the painting is so famous, everything has already been discovered,\" he said. \"But of course you always with art discover new things and that's why Rembrandt is such a great artist.\"",

      "Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that Zelenskyy's forces are \"in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form\" with Europe's help.\u00a0 The unexpected remarks \u2014 which called the Russian military a \"paper tiger\" \u2014 came after Mr. Trump met with Zelenskyy for about an hour Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.",
      "The comments appear to mark a dramatic shift for Mr. Trump, who said last month he expected \"some swapping of territories\" as part of an eventual Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal. Russia occupies large parts of eastern Ukraine, including territories captured in 2014 and in the current war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Asked later Tuesday by Fox News' Bret Baier if he was surprised by the U.S. president's about-face, Zelenskyy laughed and responded, \"a little bit.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said he and Mr. Trump had a positive conversation on Tuesday, and he believes Mr. Trump's position on territorial swaps has changed.",
      "\"I think he understands for today that we can't just swap territories. It's not fair,\" he said.",
      "During their meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that Zelenskyy was \"putting up one hell of a fight,\" and he believes the \"biggest progress\" is that the Russian economy is \"terrible.\" But the U.S. leader didn't appear optimistic about a quick resolution to the war, telling reporters, \"It looks like it's not going to end for a long time.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire deal to end their more than three-year-long war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "But a deal has remained elusive as both sides' public positions remain far apart. The Kremlin has pushed Zelenskyy to fully withdraw from large swaths of eastern Ukraine, an idea Zelenskyy has rejected as unfair and unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Ukraine has sought international security guarantees to deter another Russian attack if the current conflict ends.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin at various points. He met with Putin in Alaska last month, but he has criticized the Russian leader for continued strikes on Ukraine, and said last week that Putin had \"really let me down.\"",
      "The U.S. president also pressed NATO countries earlier this month to stop buying Russian oil and to impose hefty tariffs on China, which has remained aligned with Russia, writing that those moves could \"be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.\"",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he believes NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace, after Russian drones entered Poland earlier this month and Russian fighter jets allegedly entered Estonian airspace.",
      "At other points, though, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy have had a rocky relationship. An Oval Office meeting between the two leaders earlier this year descended into a shouting match, and Mr. Trump has occasionally blamed Zelenskyy for the war.",
      "During his interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he believes his relationship with his American counterpart has improved.",
      "\"I think we have better relation[s] than before,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I think we didn't have close relation[s] because we didn't have, maybe, time. I don't know.\"",

      "Health experts from around the globe are joining the chorus of doctors and organizations pushing back against the Trump administration's announcement Monday\u00a0linking the use of acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications \u2014 during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children.",
      "\"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,\" President Trump said at a news conference with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the European Union's European Medicines Agency said there is currently \"no new evidence\" that would require changes to the current EU recommendations for use of acetaminophen, also commonly called paracetamol outside the U.S.",
      "\"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,\" Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. \"Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.\"",
      "The United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said Tuesday, \"taking paracetamol during pregnancy remains safe.\"",
      "\"There is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children,\" the agency's chief safety officer Dr. Alison Cave said in the statement.",
      "In a combined statement, Australia's chief medical officer and the country's medicine regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, said they were joining \"other global medicines regulators, leading clinicians and scientists worldwide in rejecting claims regarding the use of paracetamol in pregnancy, and the subsequent risk of development of ADHD or autism in children.\"",
      "\"Robust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims,\" the statement continued.",
      "While sharing a statement from Spain's Ministry of Health that stated paracetamol can be used during pregnancy, the country's minister of health, M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda, called out Mr. Trump specifically for misinformation and lack of evidence.",
      "\"Trump's new crusade is against paracetamol during pregnancy, ignoring all scientific evidence,\" she wrote on X. \"This denialism only sows alarm and misinformation. It's better to listen to health authorities than to the person who suggested injecting bleach against COVID,\" referring to a remark Mr. Trump made in 2020.",
      "A World Health Organization spokesperson said Tuesday that evidence of a link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism \"remains inconsistent,\" according to Reuters.",
      "International-based studies have been part of the evidence that shows acetaminophen use during pregnancy is safe.",
      "In a\u00a0major study published last year, for example, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "In the U.S., organizations \u2014 including one that represents those who treat pregnant patients, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u2014 have countered the claimed link, saying there's \"no clear evidence.\"",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",
      "And the\u00a0Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement that any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on \"limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump suggested Tuesday that London officials want to \"go to sharia law,\" a comment London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office called \"bigoted\" and \"appalling.\"",
    "story": [
      "London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office called President Trump's comments \"bigoted,\" after the president appeared to make the false claim that London wants to \"go to sharia law\" and was a city that had \"changed\" under the mayor's leadership.",
      "\"I have to say, I look at London where you have a terrible mayor \u2014 terrible, terrible mayor \u2014 and it's been so changed, so changed,\" Mr. Trump said during his address to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. \"Now they want to go to sharia law ... Both their immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump used the word \"they\" without clarifying if he meant Khan and London, his comments echoed long running far-right conspiracy theories online linking Khan, who is the first Muslim to be elected mayor of London, to Islamic fundamentalism. There is no evidence that Khan has advocated for London to officially adopt Sharia, a system of religious laws that is used in some Muslim countries but not by the U.K. government.",
      "\"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response,\" a spokesperson for London's mayor told CBS News in an e-mailed statement Tuesday. \"London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.\"",
      "In response, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said: \"President Trump is right \u2014 unchecked migration into western countries is making the world a more dangerous place.\"",
      "A number of politicians in Britain came to Khan's defense following Mr. Trump's comments, including members of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. Khan is a member of Starmer's ruling, left-leaning Labour party.",
      "\"Sadiq Khan is not trying to impose Sharia Law on London,\" U.K. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in a post on X Tuesday. \"This is a Mayor who marches with pride, who stands up for differences of background and opinion, who's focused on improving our transport, our air, our streets, our safety, our choices and chances.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks \u2014 made within a wider context of criticizing the immigration policy of European countries \u2014 revived a spat between Khan and the president that stretches back nearly a decade.",
      "In 2015, Sadiq Khan roundly condemned then-candidate Donald Trump after he called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" on national security grounds, following a terrorist attack in California. Early in his first term, Mr. Trump moved to restrict travel to the U.S. by residents of several mostly Muslim countries, though it did not explicitly ban entry to the U.S. by all Muslims.",
      "That initial criticism has led to a colorful back-and-forth between the two over the years. Just last week, Mr. Trump said Khan was \"among the worst mayors in the world,\" and told reporters that he asked that Khan not be present at the banquet hosted by King Charles III during the president's state visit to the U.K.",
      "Mr. Trump has also often claimed that crime in London has risen dramatically during Khan's tenure, including in last week's comments to reporters, when he said crime in London was \"through the roof.\"",
      "Overall recorded crime in London has increased by 31.5% over the past 10 years, with violent crime increasing by 40%, according to U.K. office for National Statistics data cited by CBS News' partners at the BBC. Khan first took office as London's mayor in May 2016.",
      "But data from the Metropolitan Police shows that London had a homicide rate of 11.8 per million people in 2024. That makes the homicide rate in England's capital lower than in a number of major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., according to data cited by the White House.",

      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",

    "story": [
      "Inmates in Ecuador fought each other with guns and explosives in a riot that left 13 prisoners and a guard dead, police said.",
      "The mayhem was the latest in a series of bloodbaths to engulf gang-ridden, overcrowded prisons in a once-peaceful country now at ground zero of the violent Latin American drug trade.",
      "An unknown number of inmates escaped in the clash between rival gangs, during which another 14 people were injured, a masked police officer identified as commander Colonel William Calle told the Ecuavisa channel.",
      "Thirteen inmates have been recaptured.",
      "Calle said gunfire broke out in the early morning hours, alerting prison guards and police who rushed to that part of the prison in Machala, in southwest Ecuador near the Peruvian border.",
      "One guard was killed as he entered, and others were taken hostage, said the officer.",
      "Calle said the confrontation lasted about 40 minutes, during which inmates \"fired guns, threw bombs, grenades.\"",
      "The dead inmates belonged to the rival Los Choneros and Los Lobos gangs, two of the biggest drug trafficking groups in Ecuador. Earlier this month, the\u00a0U.S. designated\u00a0both gangs as foreign terrorist organizations in the Trump administration's latest move against cartels.",
      "Police said the violence was the result of \"fighting between gangs\" in a facility housing double the number of inmates it was designed for.",
      "Calle said \"control has already been regained\" over the prison.",
      "He did not specify the fate of the hostages or how many inmates were on the run.",
      "Ecuador's prisons\u00a0are among the most dangerous in the world, and many have been taken over by drug gangs. The penitentiaries have been under military control since January 2024, when President Daniel Noboa declared a\u00a0state of \"internal armed conflict\"\u00a0after a brutal wave of violence, sparked by the jailbreak of a powerful crime boss.",
      "In September 2024, the director of Ecuador's biggest prison,\u00a0Maria Daniela Icaza, was killed in an armed attack while driving. Icaza's death came just days after the head of a prison in the Amazonian province of Sucumbios, Alex Guevara, was killed, also in an attack while traveling by car.",
      "Ecuador recorded more than 4,600 homicides in the first half of the year, a 47% increase from the same period of 2024, data from the Ecuadoran Observatory of Organized Crime shows.",
      "Gang violence continues unabated following the recapture in June of the country's biggest drug lord,\u00a0Adolfo Mac\u00edas, alias Fito, after he escaped from a maximum-security prison in 2024.",
      "In July, the Ecuadoran government\u00a0extradited Mac\u00edas\u00a0to the United States, and he\u00a0pleaded not guilty. A\u00a0seven-count indictment\u00a0charged Mac\u00edas, who leads Los Choneros, with multiple counts, including international cocaine distribution and smuggling firearms from the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., discusses the rise of Zohran Mamdani and AOC and what it means for the Democratic Party on 'Hannity.'",
      "New York City voters across all demographic groups are dissatisfied with the direction of the city, and most are looking for significant change in the city\u2019s government. That sentiment has propelled Democrat Zohran Mamdani to the lead in the mayoral race despite concerns that his proposed tax increases may chase people out of the city.",
      "A new Fox News survey of New York City registered voters finds Mamdani, the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee and self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist, leading the race by 18 percentage points with 45% support.",
      "Former New York governor and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo comes in second with 27%, Republican Party nominee Curtis Sliwa gets 11% and current mayor and independent candidate Eric Adams garners 8%. Among likely voters, the race looks largely the same: 47% Mamdani, 29% Cuomo, 11% Sliwa and 7% Adams.",
      "FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS WANT GREATER INVOLVEMENT IN UKRAINE, SUPPORT CURRENT APPROACH IN ISRAEL",
      "The analysis below focuses on preferences and opinions among registered voters.",
      "Some of Mamdani\u2019s best groups include very liberal voters (79%), those under age 35 (61%), women under 45 (60%), Democrats (57%), and Black and Hispanic voters (49% each).",
      "Cuomo receives strong support from Jewish voters (40%), White voters ages 45+ (37%), voters ages 65 and higher (33%) and moderates (31%).",
      "Republicans prefer Sliwa (41%), while five times as many back Cuomo (32%) as Mamdani (6%). Independents are split: 26% Mamdani, 23% Cuomo and 14% each to Adams and Sliwa.",
      "FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP'S RATINGS ARE STRONG ON BORDER SECURITY, WEAK ON THE ECONOMY",
      "The Big Apple has problems: 62% are dissatisfied with the direction it\u2019s headed, with at least six in 10 Democrats (61%), Republicans (70%) and independents (59%) saying they are unhappy.",
      "That frustration results in three-quarters of voters wanting either substantial (37%), dramatic (20%) or revolutionary change (18%) in how the city\u2019s government is run. Mamdani has a significant lead among both those wanting at least substantial change and those dissatisfied with the city\u2019s trajectory. His advantage is so considerable he also holds an edge with voters satisfied with how things are going.",
      "Mamdani supporters are more enthusiastic about voting this year (63%) and more certain they will back him (83%) compared to the other candidates. Plus, most describe their support as for him (86%) rather than against his opponents (12%).",
      "For Cuomo, 32% of his backers are enthusiastic, 65% are certain and 59% say their vote is for him rather than against his opponents (39%).",
      "Voters say the top three problems facing New York City are crime (25%), followed by the cost of living (20%) and the lack of affordable housing (17%).",
      "Crime is the No. 1 concern for Republicans (50%) and independents (29%) while for Democrats it\u2019s divided across costs (23%), crime (19%) and housing (19%).",
      "Cuomo is narrowly favored (+12 points) among those who prioritize crime, while Mamdani has wide advantages among those citing the cost of living (+40) and housing (+41).",
      "Concerns about the high cost of living, the need for better city services and a heavy tax burden produce nuanced policy opinions. For example, seven in 10 New York City voters think raising taxes will cause a mass exodus of businesses and people that will leave the city more cash strapped.\u00a0At the same time, another seven in 10 favor raising taxes on residents with an annual income greater than $1 million. There is widespread agreement on both questions among Democrats, Republicans and independents.",
      "There\u2019s a reason Mamdani is campaigning with Bernie Sanders. New Yorkers like the Independent senator from Vermont. Sanders is the most popular individual tested on the survey (61% favorable opinion), followed by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (53%), Mamdani (50%) and Cuomo (45%). Adams (29%), Sliwa (28%) and President Donald Trump (24%) are viewed positively by around one-quarter of voters.",
      "When voters are asked to say in their own words why they like or dislike the candidates, the top positives for Mamdani are liking his policies generally, feeling he cares, change/having new ideas and his focus on affordability. The main reasons given for disliking him are he\u2019s a communist/socialist, his position on Israel, not liking his policies, lack of experience and unrealistic policies.",
      "Are Mamdani\u2019s left-leaning economic policies a potential Achilles heel? Probably not. In a city where more than twice as many voters are registered as Democrats than Republicans, capitalism is viewed more favorably than socialism by just seven points (48% vs. 41%).",
      "Experience is the top reason voters like Cuomo, while sexual harassment allegations are the main reason he is disliked. For Adams, voters also give him the thumbs-up for experience, whereas his detractors mainly focus on allegations of corruption.\u00a0For Sliwa, his main positive trait is that he\u2019s tough on crime (a top issue for voters), but his main negative is that voters don\u2019t think he is a serious candidate.",
      "\"Mamdani is the change candidate in a change election,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"And, like many voters for change candidates, his supporters are enthusiastic.\"",
      "Immigration and the Middle East",
      "Only 3% mention illegal immigration as the city\u2019s No. 1 problem, and when it comes to policy options, most (67%) favor only deporting those charged with crimes but allowing others to stay in the U.S. and apply for citizenship.",
      "On the Middle East, more voters back the Palestinians (46%) than the Israelis (38%).\u00a0That\u2019s the opposite of results nationally.\u00a0In line with Mamdani\u2019s criticism of Israel and Cuomo\u2019s support, those backing Mamdani side with the Palestinians by a 49-point margin, while those favoring Cuomo side with the Israelis by 16 points. More Jewish voters prefer Cuomo (40%) than Mamdani (27%) or Adams (12%).",
      "One more thing\u2026",
      "Twice as many NYC voters say the way Republicans talk about politics is leading to an increase in violence (68%) than feel the same about Democrats (32%). Democrats and Republicans are equally likely to think their counterparts\u2019 words lead to violence, while independents are more likely to cite Republican rhetoric as dangerous.",

There was a subsample of 814 likely voters and the margin of sampling error was \u00b13.5 percentage points. Sampling error for results among subgroups is higher. Results among subgroups are only shown when the sample size is at least N=100. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Sources for developing weight targets include the most recent American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population. Likely voters are identified based on past vote history and self-reported likelihood of voting."

      "The strikes are the latest escalation from the Trump administration as it moves to crack down on drug cartels and the influx of illicit drugs into the U.S. And they come after the administration designated drug cartel groups like Tren de Aragua, the Sinaloa Cartel and others as foreign terrorist organizations in February.",

But the risk of doing so would be that we could destabilize Venezuela and spark an internal armed conflict with no clear end game.\"",
      "Ramsey said the strikes come with a \"real risk of escalation\" and said that Venezuela views them as violations of sovereignty. Additionally, attacks inside Venezuelan territory could ignite a \"cycle of retaliation,\" he said.",
      "\"That would raise the prospect of a wider confrontation between the U.S. and Venezuelan forces, which could potentially end up sparking an internal armed conflict in the South American country, which could destabilize the region,\" Ramsey said.",
      "\"So far President Trump seems aware of these risks, which is why the strikes so far have been carefully framed as counter-narcotics operations in international waters rather than an overt attack on the Venezuelan government.\"",
      "After Trump sent the destroyers to the U.S. Southern Command, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said his country was prepared to respond to any attacks, adding that the move amounted to \"an extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\"",

      "\"President Trump has no legal authority to launch strikes or use military force in the Caribbean or elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. The Administration has refused to provide Congress with basic information about the multiple strikes it has carried out, including who was killed, why it was necessary to put service members\u2019 lives at risk, and why a standard interdiction operation wasn\u2019t conducted,\" Kaine said in a statement Friday.",

      "\"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "However, the strikes likely will not continue long term as boat traffic in the region dies down in response to the strikes, according to Bryan Clark, director of the Hudson Institute think tank\u2019s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology.",

      "But every once in a while, a new model rolls onto the scene that flips that thinking on its head. Meet the Robeta Ananya. This isn't just a van: it's a \"glamper\" on wheels, and it makes other builds look like tin cans.",

      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "A true living room, not just a chair",
      "Robeta makes it clear they really mean luxury. Instead of adding the typical swivel seat like most models, they built an actual, fully realized living room. There is a partition between the driving cab and the main cabin. The star of the show is an L-shaped couch that runs over six feet long. And it's not just any couch. It is deep, plush and inviting. It's the kind of seating where you can stretch out on without bumping into a dinette table or a cabinet corner.",
      "Robeta Mobil is offering a luxury camping experience via its newest camper model, available in 2026. (Robeta Mobil)",
      "Bedtime gets an upgrade",
      "When the sun goes down, that beautiful lounge transforms. A double bed lowers from the ceiling, turning the room into a proper bedroom without having to rearrange cushions or fold anything in a weird way. In the morning, it lifts right back up, making space for coffee and conversation. It is a smooth trick that makes the van feel more like a studio apartment than a rolling compromise. Neither the couch nor the bed needs to sacrifice comfort the way sofa beds typically do.",
      "Laundry on the road",
      "Let's talk about the washer and dryer. Yes, really. A compact Tiny Wash unit is built right into the wardrobe. It handles just enough for a quick refresh, and it actually dries, too. No more hanging socks from cabinet knobs or relying on campground and public laundromats. For extended trips, this little feature is a money saver and an absolute game changer.",

This setup is ready for real cooking, not just boiling water or reheating prepackaged meals. If you like to eat well on the road, this one is built with you in mind.",
      "A bathroom that feels like a bathroom",
      "At the rear of the van, the bathroom doesn't feel like an afterthought. It has a sink, a full-standing shower and a macerating toilet. Instead of cramming it all into a tiny box, Robeta gave it a soft curtain enclosure that keeps the look minimal and the space functional. It feels clean, intentional and refreshingly roomy.",
      "Power to keep you out there",
      "This luxury van even has the chops for off-roading. The Ananya packs a 10-kilowatt-hour EcoFlow power system with stackable batteries and 450 watts of solar. You can stay off the cord for days without blinking. Add in a 160-liter freshwater tank, diesel heat and hot water via Webasto, and the freedom to wander suddenly looks very comfortable. These amenities are remarkable for a camper van this size.",

This means you can explore remote places without giving up the little luxuries that make travel enjoyable. In short, you get the freedom of the open road with the comfort of a high-end apartment.",
      "Stay connected while you roam",
      "When you're traveling in a camper van, nothing kills the vibe faster than losing cell service, especially if you rely on your phone for maps, music, work or keeping in touch. Thankfully, there are two handy solutions to keep you connected: cell phone boosters and mobile hotspots.",
      "Cell phone boosters amplify weak signals from nearby towers, making calls clearer, boosting data speeds and reducing dropped calls. They're ideal for rural drives, national parks or even just passing through patchy areas. Installation typically involves an outside antenna to capture the signal, an amplifier to boost it and an inside antenna to rebroadcast it inside your van.",
      "Mobile hotspots, on the other hand, turn a cellular signal into a private Wi-Fi network for your devices. They're perfect for working remotely from the road, streaming movies or sharing the internet with multiple passengers. Many can run off your phone plan or use a dedicated SIM card for more robust coverage.",
      "Pro tip:\u00a0If your adventures often take you far from towns or highways, a cell phone booster is your best bet for call reliability. If you need strong Wi-Fi for work or entertainment, pair it with a mobile hotspot for the ultimate on-the-road connectivity.",

      "Social platforms are built for speed and visibility. Anyone can create an account in minutes, post content instantly and connect with strangers worldwide. This openness is what makes social media engaging, but it is also what makes it ripe for abuse. Fraudsters exploit the fact that posts, comments and messages are consumed quickly and often without much scrutiny.",

On platforms where checkmarks can be purchased, scammers can buy credibility without earning it. Add in the algorithms that reward viral content and sudden spikes in engagement, and you get the perfect environment for fraud to spread unnoticed.",

Clicking a bad link or handing over credentials can snowball into long-term consequences. Once scammers get access to your information, it can be sold on dark web marketplaces, used to open fraudulent accounts or leveraged for identity theft.",

      "Wisconsin\u2019s first large-scale solar battery park combines solar power with storage, providing reliable clean energy day and night. (We Energies)",
      "Now, a 110-megawatt battery storage system has been added. These batteries capture excess energy from the solar panels and release it at night, during cloudy weather, or when demand suddenly rises. The battery system can power about 130,000 homes for up to four hours.",

      "The Paris Solar-Battery Park reduces reliance on fossil fuels while strengthening Wisconsin's grid. It also provides a model other states can follow.",

      "This shift benefits both the environment and consumers. Solar farms have been shown to cut electric bills by 5 to 20 percent. Additionally, the Paris Solar-Battery Park is eligible for federal tax credits, which can pass on savings to residents.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018The Cyberguy\u2019 Knutsson explains how to keep your Windows computer safe and security risks of online retail giant Temu.",
      "Earlier this year, Australian police arrested a passenger for running a malicious Wi-Fi network both at an airport and during a flight. The setup looked just like the airline's own Wi-Fi service, but it wasn't. Instead, it was what cybersecurity researchers call an \"evil twin,\" a fake hotspot designed to trick people into handing over their credentials.",
      "The idea isn't new, but the setting is. For years, fake Wi-Fi networks have been a common trick in cafes, hotels, and airports. What makes this case stand out is that the attacker took it to the skies, exploiting the growing reliance on in-flight Wi-Fi for entertainment and internet access.",

      "What is an evil twin Wi-Fi attack?",
      "An evil twin hotspot is a wireless network that impersonates a legitimate one by copying its name, also known as the SSID. When multiple networks with the same name exist, your phone or laptop often connects to the one with the stronger signal, which is usually the attacker's.",
      "Travelers check their phones while navigating delays and flight cancellations at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on July 19, 2024, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)",
      "Once connected, victims are often redirected to a fake login or landing page. In this case, the malicious portal requested passengers' email addresses, passwords, or even social media credentials under the pretense of granting access to the airline's entertainment system. The stolen information could then be used for account takeovers, identity theft, or further attacks.",
      "Why travel Wi-Fi is a prime target",
      "Travel creates a perfect storm for these kinds of attacks. Whether you're in a hotel, airport, cruise ship or airplane, you often have limited choices for getting online. Mobile data may be patchy or expensive, which pushes people toward the available Wi-Fi networks. Because these services feel official and are tied to trusted brands, travelers tend to assume they're safe and let their guard down when login requests pop up.",
      "Another trend adds to the risk. Travel providers are increasingly moving entertainment and services onto personal devices instead of offering built-in options. Airlines replace seatback screens with streaming portals, cruise lines promote app-based services and hotels direct guests to digital check-in platforms. All of these require a Wi-Fi connection, which means more people are logging on than ever before.",
      "QANTAS DATA BREACH EXPOSES MILLIONS OF CUSTOMER RECORDS",
      "How hackers trick you with fake in-flight Wi-Fi",
      "Here's how it worked in the Australian case. The attacker carried a portable hotspot onboard and named it to match the airline's official Wi-Fi network. Passengers, seeing the fake network with stronger signal strength, connected automatically. They were then taken to a counterfeit login page asking for personal details.",
      "A traveler awaits their delayed luggage after United Airlines grounded flights due to a tech outage at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, Aug. 6, 2025.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Ryan Murphy)",

      "YOUR DISCARDED LUGGAGE TAGS ARE WORTH MONEY TO SCAMMERS",
      "Why you need a VPN for in-flight Wi-Fi security",
      "One of the best defenses against rogue Wi-Fi is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, making it far harder for attackers to intercept your data even if you connect to the wrong hotspot.",
      "There is a catch, though. In-flight Wi-Fi systems often require you to disable your VPN temporarily to access the onboard portal. Even then, a VPN remains an important safeguard. Once you have cleared the login page and, if you have paid, connected to the internet, enabling your VPN ensures that any browsing, messaging, or app traffic stays private.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at CyberGuy.com.",

      "A VPN is important, but it isn't the only defense you should rely on. Here are some other ways to stay safe when connecting midair:",
      "Before you even think about connecting to in-flight Wi-Fi, make sure your device has a strong antivirus installed. It's your first line of defense against malicious sites and apps that attackers may try to push through fake portals. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Even if an attacker manages to steal your login credentials,\u00a02FA can stop them from getting into your accounts. Use app-based authenticators rather than SMS codes whenever possible, since they work offline and are harder to intercept.",
      "Most phones and laptops are set to reconnect automatically to familiar networks. This makes it easier for a fake hotspot with the same name to trick your device. Before you board, switch off auto-connect and manually choose the correct airline Wi-Fi.",
      "When browsing in-flight, check for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar. HTTPS encrypts the connection between your device and the website, making it harder for attackers on public Wi-Fi to intercept your data.",
      "Even with precautions, in-flight Wi-Fi should be treated as untrusted. Avoid logging in to sensitive accounts like online banking or work systems. Stick to light browsing, streaming or messaging until you're back on a secure connection.",
      "Outdated operating systems and apps often have security holes attackers exploit. Before your trip, install the latest updates on your phone, tablet or laptop. Many updates include security patches that protect you against known vulnerabilities.",
      "When possible, switch your device to airplane mode and then enable only Wi-Fi. This reduces exposure from other radios (like Bluetooth or cellular roaming) that attackers sometimes target on flights.",
      "Some fake in-flight portals use pop-ups or redirects designed to trick you into entering login details or clicking on malicious links. If a page asks for unnecessary information, like your full Social Security number, banking details or unrelated logins, treat it as a red flag. Close the page immediately and don\u2019t click.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The rise of evil twin attacks in the air is a reminder that convenience often comes with hidden risks. As airlines push more passengers toward in-flight Wi-Fi, attackers are finding ways to exploit that dependency. Next time you fly, think twice before blindly connecting to the first Wi-Fi network that pops up. Sometimes, the safest choice is to stay offline until you land.",

      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "AI browsers are no longer just an idea; they're already here. Microsoft has built Copilot into Edge, OpenAI is testing a sandboxed browser in agent mode and Perplexity's Comet is one of the first to fully embrace the concept of browsing for you.",
      "This is agentic AI stepping into our daily routines, from searching and reading to shopping and clicking. Instead of simply assisting us, these tools are beginning to replace us.",
      "But with this shift comes a new era of digital deception. AI-powered browsers may promise convenience by handling shopping, emails and other tasks, yet research shows they can stumble into scams faster than humans ever could. This dangerous mix of speed and trust is what experts call Scamlexity, a complex, AI-driven scam landscape where your agent gets tricked, and you pay the price.",

      "Falling for the same old tricks",
      "AI browsers are not immune to classic scams. In fact, they can fall for them even faster. When researchers at Guardio Labs told an AI browser to buy an Apple Watch, it confidently completed the purchase on a fake Walmart store set up in minutes. It autofilled personal and payment details without hesitation. The scammer got the money, while the human never saw the red flags.",
      "AI browsers promise convenience, but security experts warn they can fall for online scams faster than humans. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Handling phishing emails from \"your bank\"",
      "Old phishing tactics also remain effective. In testing, researchers at Guardio Labs sent a fake Wells Fargo email to the AI browser. The browser clicked the malicious link with no verification and even helped the user fill out login credentials on the phishing page. By removing human intuition from the loop, the AI created a perfect trust chain that scammers could exploit.",
      "PromptFix: A modern AI injection scam",
      "The real danger comes from attacks designed specifically for AI. Researchers at Guardio Labs created PromptFix, a scam disguised as a CAPTCHA page. While humans would only see a checkbox, the AI agent read hidden malicious instructions in the page code. Believing it was \"helping,\" the AI clicked the button, triggering a download that could have been malware. This type of prompt injection bypasses human awareness and targets the AI's decision-making directly. Once compromised, the AI can send emails, share files or execute harmful tasks without the user ever knowing.",
      "The growing risks of AI browsers",
      "As agentic AI becomes mainstream, scams will scale at an alarming speed. Instead of fooling millions of people individually, attackers need only to compromise one AI model to reach millions at once. Security experts warn this is a structural risk, not just a phishing problem.",
      "Tips to protect yourself from AI browser scams",
      "AI browsers can save time, but they can also put you at risk if you rely on them too much. Use these practical steps to stay in control and reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Always double-check sensitive actions like purchases, downloads or logins. Keep final approval in your hands instead of letting the AI complete tasks on its own. This way, you prevent scammers from sneaking past your awareness.",
      "Scammers rely on exposed personal details to make their tricks more convincing. A trusted data removal service can help scrub your information from broker sites, reducing the chance that your AI agent hands over details that are already floating around online. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

    "summary": "Expert tips for buying refurbished electronics reveal what to check before purchase, including warranty policies and seller reputation.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Buying refurbished electronics sounds like a no-brainer. You get the latest gadgets at a fraction of the cost while giving devices a second life, which is better for the environment. It seems like the perfect solution for those on a budget, but it isn't always that simple. Not every refurbished device is equal, and the fine print matters more than you think.",
      "Some sellers do a fantastic job restoring products, while others barely touch them before reselling. If you're considering refurbished tech, here are important lessons I wish I knew beforehand. These insights will help you make smarter choices, avoid headaches and get real value for your money.",

      "Researching a seller\u2019s track record is more important than chasing after the lowest refurbished price point. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Imo/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "1) Refurbished does not always mean like new",
      "In the tech industry, the label refurbished carries no uniform standard. From factory-certified devices that meet stringent quality checks to third-party refurbishments that address only surface-level defects, the range is vast. My experience shows that treating refurbished items as \"like new\" is a mistake. Many come with cosmetic blemishes or partially worn components, and some sellers stop at a basic reset and cleaning.",
      "The key is to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process and request detailed specifications or photos to ensure the item is in good condition. Look for transparency about what has been repaired or replaced. A reputable refurbisher will disclose whether critical components such as screens, batteries or motherboards were replaced or simply tested.",
      "Pro tip: Many refurbishers use a grading system (A, B, C). Grade A means near new, Grade B usually has light scratches, while Grade C shows heavier wear. Knowing the grade helps set realistic expectations.",
      "2) Check the warranty and return policy",
      "One of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of buying refurbished electronics is the warranty and return policy. Through years of testing products, I've seen warranties vary wildly from generous 90-day coverage to none at all. A solid warranty is not just a formality; it's a reflection of the refurbisher's confidence in the quality of the product. Without it, you're taking a gamble.",
      "Industry best practices suggest opting for sellers who provide at least a 90-day warranty and a clear, no-hassle return window. I have consistently seen reliable refurbishers like Amazon Renewed, eBay Certified Refurbished and Back Market stand by their work with transparent policies.",
      "Also look at Apple Certified Refurbished and Dell Outlet, which are industry leaders for high-quality laptops, tablets and phones.",
      "3) Know the seller's reputation",
      "Not all sellers are equal when it comes to refurbished tech. My years covering consumer electronics have made it clear that choosing a reputable seller is more important than chasing the lowest price. Factory-certified refurbishers and authorized resellers tend to follow strict testing and quality control procedures. In contrast, independent sellers often vary in quality and reliability.",
      "I always emphasize researching the seller's history, reading verified customer reviews and ensuring they offer clear refurbishment guarantees. Established marketplaces and brand-certified stores provide additional layers of security, including dispute resolution mechanisms.",
      "Red flags include: vague warranty language, listings with only stock photos, \"open box\" items marketed as refurbished and any product sold \"as-is.\" If you see those, walk away.",
      "4) Don't forget accessories and packaging",
      "A less obvious but important consideration is the state of accessories and packaging. In industry practice, refurbished products rarely arrive in original packaging or with the full set of accessories. I've seen that some sellers ship devices with generic boxes and subpar third-party accessories or omit chargers and manuals altogether.",
      "If accessories are important to your workflow, don't assume they'll be included. Always verify the listing description and, when in doubt, ask the seller directly. Knowing exactly what comes in the box prevents surprises and ensures you don't have to hunt for compatible chargers or cables after the fact, potentially eroding any savings you initially gained.",
      "5) Battery life may not be the same",
      "A common misconception is that refurbished devices come with batteries that perform like new, but that's not the case. Batteries naturally degrade with use, and not all refurbishers replace them.",
      "Some sellers disclose battery replacement while others do not. It is critical to confirm whether the battery is new, tested or original. Otherwise, expect performance issues such as rapid discharge or failure to hold a charge. A device with a worn-out battery is rarely worth the lower upfront cost, as you'll likely need to replace the battery soon after purchase.",

      "A good warranty and return policy are essential safeguards for choosing refurbished devices. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "6) Software updates and compatibility",
      "You should only use electronic items like phones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches as long as they're receiving software updates. Many might disagree with this, but the truth is that once software support ends, your device becomes vulnerable to all kinds of unpatchable security flaws. Some good brands known for reliable software support are Apple, Samsung, Google, MSI and Lenovo.",
      "Before purchasing, always verify that the device is still supported with regular updates. This information is often available on the manufacturer's website or through trusted tech resources.",
      "7) Test the device thoroughly after purchase",
      "Testing a refurbished device thoroughly upon arrival is a best practice I've recommended repeatedly in my writing. Even trusted sellers can occasionally miss a defect. I always advise checking every essential function, such as the screen, charging port, Wi-Fi, sound and camera, within the seller's return period. Many problems won't be obvious from photos or descriptions alone.",
      "Immediate testing ensures you catch issues early enough to return or replace the product without hassle. It's a small investment of time that prevents far bigger frustrations later.",
      "And don't forget to perform your own factory reset on\u00a0iPhone,\u00a0Android,\u00a0PC or Mac to ensure no old accounts, locks or data are lingering on the device. For Apple devices, make sure \"Find My iPhone\" has been disabled before purchase, or it may be unusable.",
      "8) Install strong antivirus software",
      "Refurbished devices can sometimes carry hidden risks, especially if the previous owner didn't wipe the device properly or if the seller missed deep software issues. Installing\u00a0 strong antivirus software is essential to protect your device from malware, spyware or other security threats that may be lurking.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "9) Use a password manager",
      "Security doesn't end with antivirus protection. Many refurbished devices come with pre-installed software or misconfigured settings that could expose you to risk. One of the smartest moves you can make is using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "10) Know the real value of your savings",
      "Refurbished doesn't always mean a bargain. As a rule of thumb, expect to save 20-40% compared to new, depending on the brand, age and condition. If you're only saving 10-15%, the trade-off on warranty, lifespan or battery may not be worth it. Calculate the long-term cost, especially if you'll need to buy a new battery or accessories soon after.",

      "Refurbished products often arrive without original packaging or accessories, leaving buyers unprepared. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Bonus: The eco-friendly upside",
      "Every refurbished device purchased keeps one more gadget out of the landfill and reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Studies show buying refurbished can cut a product's carbon footprint nearly in half. That means you're not only saving money but also helping the planet.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Buying refurbished electronics can be a great way to save money and reduce e-waste. But it pays to be careful. By sticking with certified sellers, knowing what \"refurbished\" really means and insisting on warranties and clear return policies, you can protect both your wallet and your data.",

      "However, many questions surrounding Robinson\u2019s alleged actions leading up to and after the shooting, along with a potential motive or possibility of co-conspirators, remain unanswered.",
      "\"[Investigators] have to find this happy medium about sharing information that the public needs to know while maintaining some level of secrecy,\"\u00a0Peter Valentin, chair of the Forensic Science Department at the University of New Haven and a former Connecticut State Police detective, told Fox News Digital. \"So you don\u2019t give away whatever tactical advantage you have.\"",

      "Surveillance video captured Robinson arriving on campus at approximately 8:30 a.m. on the morning of the shooting, according to authorities. Several hours later, police say Robinson was seen on video walking with a limp through a nearby neighborhood toward the school \u2013 just minutes before the fatal shot was fired.",
      "However, the suspect\u2019s full escape route and movements after the shooting have yet to be revealed.",
      "\"Investigators are going to canvas the neighborhood and watch all that footage to see if there\u2019s a vehicle making its way towards the campus, and then subsequently making its way from the campus after the shooting,\" Valentin said.",

      "Investigators search a taped-off area in Orem, Utah, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. (Derek Shook for Fox News Digital)",
      "According to police, Robinson climbed onto a nearby rooftop and fired off a single round \u2013 killing Kirk.",
      "Valentin suggested video of Robinson allegedly climbing from the top of the building indicates he intended to take advantage of the chaotic moments after the shooting to make his escape.",
      "\"There\u2019s clearly really no concern about whether anybody was going to see him leaving the scene, as he just jumped off the roof,\" Valentin said. \"If you take a look at what\u2019s going on at the time of the video being captured, everyone is running from the amphitheater area. So you can imagine people\u2019s ability to take note of things like this is probably somewhat diminished.\"",
      "After the shooting, investigators discovered a bolt-action rifle wrapped in a towel and stashed in a nearby wooded area. Text messages allegedly sent by Robinson to his roommate in the immediate aftermath suggest he intended to return for his weapon, with experts pointing to several signs that could indicate if he truly intended to conceal the firearm.",

      "\"It might be as simple as, was there any evidence of any attempt to conceal the firearm \u2013 as opposed to it being dropped on the ground?\" Valentin told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s hard to understand why he would have had to leave the rifle, unless he was concerned about not being able to leave the area quickly enough to avoid being searched or having his vehicle stopped.\"",
      "In the charging documents, prosecutors revealed the gun previously belonged to Robinson\u2019s grandfather.",
      "\"It seems like this gun was in the family, so then that aspect of the investigation probably does not have the prominence it might have in other kinds of cases,\" Valentin said.",

      "\"As important as the timing of the messages are the timing of the responses,\" Valentin said. \"Because I know there has been some reporting on responses to his message in Discord suggesting what could be termed as \u2018knowledge of the attack.\u2019 And law enforcement will have to assess whether or not the conversations that are happening\u00a0demonstrate an awareness of the pending attack.\"",
      "In addition to the messages, investigators can also use DNA evidence collected from the alleged murder weapon \u2013 or the towel it was wrapped in \u2013 to determine if Robinson acted alone or with someone else, according to Valentin.",

      "\"I would not be surprised if the actual results of the testing were to indicate that there were other DNA profiles on the towel, DNA profiles that are, as of right now at least, unknown,\" Valentin told Fox News Digital. \"And the investigators would like to figure out whose DNA that is, because if you're drawing the inference that someone's DNA on the towels means that they had handled it at about the time of the shooting, having more than one DNA profile means that you potentially have more than one person contributing to this.\"",

      "\"On such a historic occasion, what he will try to emphasize and underline is that this is a new day for Syria. They have overthrown the brutal dictatorship of the Assad regime.

      "A high-ranking Syrian government official confirmed to Fox News Digital that al-Sharaa will use the opportunity at the U.N. to present Syria\u2019s vision for stability, reconstruction, and reconciliation.",
      "\"The most important issues he will raise include the need to lift all forms of unilateral sanctions that continue to hinder Syria\u2019s recovery, the importance of combating terrorism in all its forms, the return of displaced Syrians and refugees, and the advancement of a genuinely inclusive political process rooted in the will of the Syrian people,\" the Syrian official said.",
      "Al-Sharaa, who led the Islamist rebel group Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) to victory over Assad, ditched his military fatigues for a Western-style suit and has been on a charm offensive, hosting European and Western diplomats and politicians in hopes of bringing Syria out from its international pariah status.",
      "The new Syrian leader received an unprecedented endorsement from President Donald Trump when the two met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in May.",

      "Hall noted that al-Sharaa might be looking to secure a security pact between Israel and Syria along the UNGA sidelines, emphasizing that he seeks a Syria that is at peace with its neighbors and doesn't want to position Syria to be a threat to any outside forces, particularly Israel.",
      "He will also be looking to secure much-needed reconstruction aid to rebuild a country ravaged by 13 years of civil war. The cost for reconstruction is estimated to be between $250 and $400 billion, and 16.7 million people, or 75% of the population, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N.",

      "ISLAMIST GROUP RUNNING SYRIA HAS MIXED RECORD OVER GOVERNANCE IN PROVINCE, RULED WITH 'IRON FIST'",
      "Al-Sharaa also fulfilled promises to target ISIS and other terrorist groups operating in Syria. One month after taking power, Syrian security forces seized a shipment of heavy ammunition destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, once a key ally of the Assad regime and Iran\u2019s Axis of Resistance.",
      "While optimism for a new Syria remains high, some caution it\u2019s still too soon to judge al-Sharaa as a Western ally given his terrorist past.",
      "\"Al-Sharaa is not a democrat. He ruled Idlib without power-sharing. So far, in terms of control of vital government functions like security, foreign affairs, intelligence and justice, he has put loyalists in place,\" former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"Al-Sharaa's heavy hand ruling Idlib prior to Assad's fall has been lighter in Damascus, Aleppo and elsewhere. But so far, there is more political freedom to speak and protest in Syria than in many other countries in the region, such as Egypt, Algeria and some Gulf states,\" Ford added.",
      "Ambassador Barbara Leaf, who served as assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, visited Damascus and met with Shara in December, becoming the highest-ranking official to meet with Syrian leadership since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011.",
      "Leaf, a distinguished diplomatic fellow with the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital about her initial contact with Shara right after HTS overthrew Assad. Her mission was to get eyes on him, to assess him and to send a clear signal on U.S. expectations if he was going to lead a new Syria.",
      "\"My takeaway from the meeting was that he came across as somebody who was very well-prepared for the discussion. He had clearly anticipated all of the topics that I raised and he had pretty thoughtful responses with a readiness to engage,\" she said.",

      "Al-Sharaa made a point several times to say that Syria would no longer be a threat or a staging point for threats against its neighbors, including Israel, and that he would not allow the Iranians, Hezbollah or Palestinian groups, to use Syrian territory to conduct terrorist activities, the ambassador said.",
      "\"I came to the sense that he was already making a shift from being a military commander to being a politician, to being a political leader,\" Ambassador Leaf noted.",
      "While Ambassador Leaf highlighted his pragmatism, his true intentions as the new leader of Syria remain murky.",
      "The ambassador said that it appears al-Sharaa has traveled a trajectory away from his jihadist terrorist past, but it remains a question how far he is willing to go to effectuate what she believes is an intention to form an Islamist style of governance.",

      "\"Does he want to formulate a kind of Islamist governance, conservative governance and social order that, frankly, Syria has not seen? And would he be willing to use force to get there? That's an unknown,\" the ambassador cautioned.",
      "What\u2019s concerning for Ambassador Leaf and others is that many of the people serving in key roles in the transitional government are close associates of al-Sharaa and others affiliated with HTS and other allied armed rebel groups.",
      "\"Al-Sharaa is still engaged in a careful balancing act within his own government between liberal opposition voices, former regime bureaucrats and more Islamist proponents aligned still with HTS\u2019 mission and principles,\" Caroline Rose, director of The New Lines Institute, told Fox News Digital.",

      "While Syria\u2019s new government has looked to consolidate control over a restive society, Shara\u2019s forces had to manage a fragile society divided along ethnic and religious lines.",
      "Syria has experienced a wave of sectarian violence since the revolution to overthrow Assad. Government security forces retaliated after forces loyal to the Assad regime launched an attack in the coastal city of Latakia, Assad\u2019s hometown. In total, around 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were massacred, according to the U.N. Most of the victims from the Alawites, a minority group in Syria, which the Assad family belonged to, as well as from the Druze community.",
      "It was the worst episode of violence since the overthrow of Assad in December 2024.",

      "Clashes between Bedouin tribes, Druze militias and government forces in Suweida led to hundreds of deaths and drew in Israeli military intervention \u2014 to protect Syria's Druze minority. A ceasefire was eventually agreed to but the spiraling ethnic violence highlights Syria's rocky transition.",
      "The country's dwindling Christian community has also felt the brunt of extremist violence. In June, the Islamic State was suspected of carrying out a deadly suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church in Syria, which killed 22 worshipers and injured 63 others. Christians have also been attacked and, in some cases, killed, allegedly by forces tied to the al-Sharaa government.",

      "Concern over direct NATO conflict with Moscow escalated earlier this month after a swarm of at least 19 Russian drones not only flew over Polish airspace, but forced a multi-nation response when NATO, for the first time since the war began, fired upon Russian assets and brought down as many as four drones that posed a threat.",
      "While Trump suggested that the drone swarm could have been a mistake, Poland refuted this and said it was \"deliberate\" and a \"planned provocation.\"",
      "Drone strikes have long been a favored wartime tool of Russia's in its operation against Ukraine, with the number of strikes peaking in July with some 6,297 long-range drones fired across the country.",
      "That figure dipped to 4,216 drones fired in August. Though notably, the majority of those UAVs were fired between Aug. 16th and the 31st, when some 3,001 drones were deployed beginning the day after Trump met with Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15.",
      "An American company, which sat less than 30 miles from two other NATO nations, Hungary and Slovakia, was also hit with \"several\" cruise missiles in late August.",
      "\"The scope of air attacks from Russia to Ukraine is really rising. They are using more drones, more rockets, and they are still expected to rise,\" Sakaliene said.",
      "\"We have to admit and adapt to this new reality. High intensity war by Russia against Ukraine is ongoing,\" the defense minister said. \"That means that more and more UAVs are going to wander off into the territories of the bordering countries, and even further.\"",
      "Russia has increasingly turned to gray-zone tactics, which involve incidents that fall below the threshold of open warfare, but which allow Russia to test NATO\u2019s resolve and response capabilities.",
      "Over the last month, Poland saw three separate incidents in which its airspace was violated by Russian drones, including UAVs carrying explosive components that crossed into its airspace from both Ukraine and Belarus.",

      "But these tactics are not the only threats that security experts in recent weeks have flagged as concerning behavior from Moscow.",
      "Earlier this month, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) based in Washington, D.C. drew attention to an op-ed published by former Russian president and current Security Council chair Dmitry Medvedev on Sept. 8 in the state-sponsored news outlet TASS, which used language that directly mirrored rhetoric by the Kremlin in the lead up to its invasion of Ukraine.",

      "Derrick Dearman appeared to be high on drugs in his Alabama prison in the days leading up to his execution.",
      "The convicted killer raged in phone calls and emails, anguishing over how his willingness to die for his crimes wouldn\u2019t change the perception of him as an irredeemable monster.",
      "And by the time he took his final breath, his longtime addiction to methamphetamine \u2014 the drug he blamed for fueling the murders of five people, including a pregnant woman, in 2016 \u2014 had consumed him to the end.",
      "Dearman, 36, had meth in his body when Alabama put him to death by lethal injection in October 2024, according to a toxicology report confirming what eyewitnesses believed at the time.",
      "He isn\u2019t the only prisoner to be executed with narcotics in their system in Alabama recently.",
      "Since Alabama resumed executions in 2023, following a pause on capital punishment amid a series of failed lethal injection attempts, the state has executed 11 people, including Dearman. An NBC News review of available autopsies shows that at least three others had taken illegal drugs prior to their executions: Jamie Ray Mills, 50, was executed last year with meth in his body, while Carey Dale Grayson, 50, and Kenneth Smith, 58, died last year with a form of a synthetic cannabinoid in their system, according to their toxicology reports. Synthetic cannabinoids imitate the effects of substances like marijuana.",
      "Alabama has its fourth execution of the year scheduled for Thursday.",
      "Jon Ozmint, a former prosecutor who was the director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections from 2003 to 2011, said that the discovery during autopsy of drugs unrelated to an execution and not prescribed to an inmate would have been \u201ca red flag for us.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe definitely would have launched an after-action review, and then, if there was any indication of you know, staff wrongdoing, we would have launched the appropriate level of investigation,\u201d Ozmint said.",
      "Mills was executed by lethal injection, and Grayson and Smith died by an execution method using nitrogen gas. (Smith was the first inmate in the nation to die in that manner.)",
      "The amount of the drugs found in Dearman, Mills, Grayson and Smith was relatively small, independent medical experts who reviewed the inmates\u2019 records told NBC News, but their detection still indicates the drugs had been recently absorbed.",
      "D\u2019Michelle DuPre, a forensic consultant in South Carolina and a former medical examiner, has analyzed about 125 death row inmates\u2019 toxicology reports throughout her career, she said.",
      "\u201cI have rarely seen an opioid in the inmates\u2019 tox screen. I don\u2019t recall seeing a narcotic,\u201d DuPre noted.",
      "Charlotte Morrison, a senior attorney with the Equal Justice Initiative, which represented Mills in his death row case, said drugs are generally less of a problem on death row in Alabama\u2019s William C. Holman Correctional Facility because of heightened security and inmates\u2019 isolation.",
      "However, she said, she\u2019s not surprised to learn that even those inmates can score drugs, indicating the depths of the problem.",
      "\u201cThe entire system is poorly managed,\u201d Morrison said. Drugs \u201care a pervasive crisis.\u201d",
      "The Alabama Department of Corrections and the state attorney general\u2019s office did not immediately respond to inquiries about the inmates\u2019 toxicology results.",
      "According to the state\u2019s execution protocol, on the afternoon of an execution, \u201ca medical examination of the condemned inmate will be completed, with the results recorded on a Medical Treatment Record or Body Chart.\u201d The Department of Corrections also did not immediately respond when asked if workers are checking for drug use in that final examination and what happens if it is detected.",
      "In a deposition last October involving Grayson\u2019s case, Corrections Commissioner John Hamm acknowledged drugs are circulating in Alabama\u2019s prisons. He agreed that, in some instances, corrections employees may be smuggling the contraband into the prisons and selling them to prisoners.",
      "In recent months, the Department of Corrections said a corrections officer was accused of the large-scale trafficking of narcotics, including meth and marijuana, at the state prison in St. Clair County. Additionally, visitors have attempted to bring drugs into facilities, including at Holman, or used drones to drop backpacks containing drugs onto prison grounds.",
      "The drug trade has had lethal consequences, as well. Of the 277 deaths last year of inmates in state Department of Corrections custody, 46 were classified as \u201caccidental/overdose,\u201d according to an ACLU of Alabama report.",
      "In 2020, the Justice Department sued Alabama for alleged constitutional violations within its prison system, citing instances of excessive force, sexual abuse and poor sanitary conditions. The suit also mentioned the system\u2019s \u201cfailure to prevent the introduction of illegal contraband leads to prisoner-on-prisoner violence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe use of illicit substances, including methamphetamines or fentanyl or synthetic cannabinoids, is prevalent in Alabama\u2019s prison for men,\u201d the complaint alleges. \u201cPrisoners using illicit substances often harm others or become indebted to other prisoners.\u201d",
      "The federal government\u2019s lawsuit against Alabama remains ongoing, and the state has largely denied the allegations in court filings.",
      "Carla Crowder, the executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a nonprofit criminal justice reform organization that provides legal and re-entry services, said prison officials have the ability to root out drugs in prisons \u201cfrom a public corruption perspective.\u201d",
      "\u201cStart tracking down the source \u2014 who\u2019s in charge, who\u2019s calling the shots,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cWe are advocating for the state to begin to take this seriously.\u201d",
      "During Commissioner Hamm\u2019s deposition, one of Grayson\u2019s lawyers pointed out the ability for some death row inmates to acquire drugs, including his own client \u2014 and questioned whether that affected Grayson\u2019s ability to meaningfully participate in his own defense.",
      "\u201cMr. Grayson admitted that he was on drugs at the time of his deposition or had taken them in the immediate \u2014 in the preceding 12 hours,\u201d lawyer Spencer Hahn told U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand how a person who is being held on single block at the most secure prison in the state of Alabama is allowed to alter his consciousness using drugs before a deposition that is central to his case,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cSo a lot of what Mr. Grayson said and may not have said, he was not in his right mind in a lot of ways.\u201d",
      "Hahn added that Grayson had been under the influence of flakka, a synthetic stimulant similar to the more commonly known bath salts.",
      "He said Grayson\u2019s drug use was also consistent with a synthetic cannabinoid found in Smith\u2019s autopsy. An attorney for the state responded that the synthetic cannabinoid Smith consumed was \u201csmoked.\u201d",
      "\u201cCertainly taking drugs is illegal, but so is providing drugs to a prisoner. \u201d",
      "Said Spencer hahn, a lawyer for a Death row inmate",
      "\u201cHaving access to these mind-altering substances can absolutely impact your conscious state and your decision-making,\u201d said David Dadiomov, an assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California.",
      "Dadiomov also said the way these drugs are used among people who are incarcerated is different because of the setting.",
      "\u201cThings are misused simply based on access,\u201d he said. \u201cAt extremely high doses, because these substances are usually very potent, they also cause psychotic-like effects, or effects that are quite different from what people classically view as intoxication from marijuana.\u201d",
      "During Hamm\u2019s deposition, Hahn questioned how Smith could have drugs in his system when he \u201chad been watched for four days straight before an execution.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomehow he was able to, from an isolation cell, obtain flakka or whatever that synthetic cannabinoid source was,\u201d Hahn said of Smith.",
      "\u201cCertainly taking drugs is illegal,\u201d Hahn added, \u201cbut so is providing drugs to a prisoner. And somebody got those drugs into that prison.\u201d",
      "During the deposition, the judge suggested drugs could be getting into Alabama prisons another way.",
      "\u201cThere has been an issue in the state prison system of lawyers bringing in papers that have been soaked in drugs and then giving them to their clients and DOC, you know, or whatever the facility maybe can\u2019t stop that from happening because it\u2019s legal papers,\u201d Judge Huffaker said. \u201cAnd then the particular inmate smokes or ingests it or does whatever with it.\u201d",
      "Hahn denied his law office had ever done so.",
      "He declined to comment about Grayson\u2019s case when reached by NBC News this week.",
      "A lawyer for Smith also couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A U.S. film distributor has criticized a Chinese studio for reportedly using artificial intelligence to make a gay couple straight when distributing the body horror film \u201cTogether\u201d in China.",
      "Early this month, moviegoers who attended preview screenings said on Chinese social media that one of two men shown getting married in the film was digitally altered into a woman, most likely with AI.",
      "Neon, the film\u2019s global distributor, said Wednesday that it \u201cdoes not approve of\u201d the \u201cunauthorized\u201d edit of the film by Chengdu-based film distributor Hishow and that screenings of the altered version must be stopped, Deadline reported.",
      "Written and directed by Australian filmmaker Michael Shanks, the movie tells the story of a couple, played by American actors Alison Brie and Dave Franco, who move to the countryside to save their relationship and encounter a mysterious force that draws them closer.",
      "Hishow offered the first pre-release screenings in 11 Chinese cities starting Sept. 12, with the movie scheduled to be released nationwide on Sept. 19.",
      "Many early viewers took to social media to complain about the gender change.",
      "One user on Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, a Chinese platform similar to Instagram, described the AI alteration of the same-sex wedding as \u201coutrageous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe version shown in mainland China didn\u2019t delete this scene. Instead, it photoshopped a woman\u2019s face over one of the men,\u201d the person posted. \u201cIt looked quite reasonable. Even the American conservatives would be impressed!\u201d",
      "The state-owned China Film Group Corporation said last week that the wide release of \u201cTogether\u201d had been postponed due to \u201ca change in the film\u2019s distribution plan,\u201d without offering further details.",
      "\u201cThe specific new date will be announced once it is confirmed,\u201d it said.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Hishow and Neon for comment.",
      "Though imported films are often edited by Chinese censors to cut scenes deemed too sensitive or risqu\u00e9, this appears to be among the first instances of technology being used to change a scene instead.",
      "One of the biggest subjects of censorship is homosexuality, which despite being decriminalized in China has been the target of a government crackdown in recent years, even though surveys shows the public is increasingly supportive of LGBTQ people.",
      "In 2021, Chinese authorities banned \u201ceffeminate\u201d behavior from screens, and fans complained in 2022 when they noticed the removal of an LGBTQ storyline from the TV sitcom \u201cFriends,\u201d which is highly popular in China. At least 10 scenes with gay references were also dropped from the Chinese version of the 2018 biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d about the rock musician and Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.",
      "The alteration of the \u201cTogether\u201d wedding scene \u201csignifies that the government has a clear stance, and they have a red line,\u201d Jason Coe, who teaches courses on film and media studies at the University of Hong Kong, told NBC News. \u201cThey will look to enforce it, and they will find innovative ways to enforce it.\u201d",
      "Zeng Hong, an assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film, agreed that the apparent use of AI in \u201cTogether\u201d is not \u201clooking promising for LGBTQ rights as well as their representation on Chinese screens.\u201d",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time that artificial intelligence has been used to alter a film in Asia.",
      "Early last month, the 2013 hit Bollywood romantic drama \u201cRaanjhanaa\u201d was re-released in India with its ending altered by AI in what is believed to be a world first, setting off a debate about the future of storytelling in the country and beyond.",
      "The original version of the film ends with the death of a Hindu man who has a doomed romance with a Muslim woman. In the new version he lives, in what production house Eros International said was a \u201ccreative reinterpretation.\u201d",
      "The film\u2019s director, Aanand L. Rai, who was unaware of the changes, called the decision \u201cdeeply disrespectful.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo cloak a film\u2019s emotional legacy in a synthetic cape without consent, is not a creative act,\u201d Rai wrote in a post on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s an abject betrayal of everything we built.\u201d"

      "Among the group, which includes a correctional officer, film producer and rocket scientist, are two players who will return for the show\u2019s milestone 50th season, premiering in spring 2026. The network has already announced 22 members of the all-returnees cast and will later reveal the two additional contestants from \u201cSurvivor\u201d 49 that were asked to play again.",

      "\u201cEvery time a new group comes in, they find a different way to do something with the Shot in the Dark, or they encounter a new take on the Beware Advantage,\u201d he said, referring to twists that have been added in the \u201cnew era\u201d of \u201cSurvivor.\u201d \u201cAnytime something like that happens, it now gifts the game because new things are possible or new things are plausible, even if they haven\u2019t happened yet.\u201d",
      "Probst continued, \u201cWhen Rizo and Shannon and Savannah and Jawan and Kristina all get out there this season, they have their own take on the game, but they\u2019re also bringing 48 seasons of history of what has worked, what hasn\u2019t worked, what they should encounter, what they should expect to encounter. That\u2019s what makes it unique \u2014 that they\u2019re playing with more history than the previous group had and therefore, maybe it\u2019s a slightly more evolved group every time.\u201d",
      "He also teased that loyalty during the second half of the season is like \u201ca temporary tattoo,\u201d hinting the gameplay will be ruthless.",

      "Kimberly J. Brown and her former \"Halloweentown\" co-star and husband, Daniel Kountz, are starring in a highly anticipated movie sequel this Halloween season \u2014 but not the one you might be expecting.",
      "The actors and real-life spouses first worked together in the 2001 Disney film \u201cHalloweentown II: Kalabar\u2019s Revenge.\u201d Over two decades later, they're teaming up once again for another Halloween movie but this time, with the Hallmark Channel.",
      "Out on Oct. 11, \u201cHaul Out the Halloween\" is the third installment in the \u201cHaul Out the Holly\u201d series, which is centered around the residents of Evergreen Lane, a neighborhood homeowner association that pulls out all the stops to decorate for Christmas.",
      "When Brown and Kountz's characters, Luna and Marvin, move to the block, their neighbors aren't sure what to think when they see their extravagant Halloween decoration display.",
      "\u201cWe really enjoyed getting to play a different side of the Halloween excitement. We\u2019ve been on the magical, witchy and warlock side before, and it was fun to play some characters that are Shakespeare buffs and into the history and the spookiness of Halloween,\u201d Brown tells TODAY.com over a video call.",
      "\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have checked off any more boxes of a dream scenario,\u201d Brown says of her role in the film.",
      "In the holiday flick, Luna and Marvin's neighbors agree to give Halloween the attention it deserves. Along the way, they work together to plan a Halloween charity fundraiser.",
      "Brown says she and her husband were already fans of the \u201cHaul Out the Holly\u201d series before signing on for the movie, as she's been best friends with one of the film's stars, Lacey Chabert, since childhood.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a proud bestie. I try to support wherever I can and watch whatever I can. (Daniel and I) had actually decorated our Christmas tree to the 'Haul Out the Holly' premiere the year (it) first premiered and enjoyed it and laughed and loved the cast,\" she says.",
      "When Chabert told Brown another film was in development and she wanted her to be involved, the \"Halloweentown\" star felt \"giddy\" and started \"slightly fangirling.\"",
      "\u201cGetting to be a part of that world was truly just very exciting for us because we had been fans since the beginning,\u201d she says.",
      "Brown calls the experience of working with Chabert \u201cthe absolute best.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn one of our first scenes, standing across Lacey and next to Daniel, I had this kind of pinch me moment. What a dream (and) blessing of a job to be able to act across my best friend and then act next to my husband. And we all got to do it together and laugh and have fun,\" she says.",
      "Brown says fans can expect a mix of \u201cspookiness,\u201d \u201claughter\u201d and \u201cfestive magic\u201d in the film, plus some epic Halloween sweaters.",
      "\u201cFor Halloween being such a spooky holiday, it\u2019s equally as balanced with so much laughter in this movie,\u201d Brown describes, adding that she and Kountz would be \u201cexcited\u201d to return for any potential sequels to the film series.",
      "The 'Halloweentown' Legacy",
      "Brown and Kountz starred together in \"Halloweentown II\" but they didn't connect on a romantic level until over a decade later, when she reached out to her former co-star to take part in some sketches she was filming for her YouTube channel. The rest is history.",
      "Brown says they still honor their \"Halloweentown\" legacy by regularly taking part in fan events, especially around Halloween. Naturally, fans are always curious to know if she'd be open to doing more \"Halloweentown\" sequels in the future.",
      "\u201cI am totally down to do another one. Disney knows I\u2019m down to do another one, so the ball\u2019s in their court. The fans pitch me storylines and all kinds of things. So yes, we would all love to get back together and do another one,\u201d she says.",
      "It's been nearly 27 years since the first \"Halloweentown\" movie was released. When asked why she thinks the fanbase is still going strong, Brown notes that the Cromwell family is \"very relatable.\"",
      "\"When I was filming the first 'Halloweentown,' I was 13, and I was also trying to figure out who I was, just like Marnie was,\" she says. \"It\u2019s been such an honor to watch the movies grow over the years. We were just supposed to do one movie back in the day, and because of the incredible fans and and how they\u2019ve put so much love into it over the years, we got to do sequels and and now they\u2019re on Disney+.\"",
      "Brown, who also starred in the franchise's second and third films, says the success of \"Halloweentown\" is beyond their \"wildest dreams.\" She added that she's \"touched\" to know people \"still share their Halloween with the movies.\"",
      "Brown's Own Halloween Traditions",
      "It's no secret that Brown's real-life love for Halloween runs deep.",
      "While Brown\u2019s Halloween display isn\u2019t quite as grand as her character in \u201cHaul Out the Halloween,\u201d she\u2019s certainly got some decorating skills of her own, as seen on her Instagram.",
      "Brown says she looks forward to putting up a Halloween tree for the first time this year.",
      "In addition to decorating for the spooky season, Brown says she and Kountz also enjoy planning family costumes with their dog, Luna, and usually start mulling over ideas mid-summer.",
      "\u201cLuna has pretty much become aware that most Halloweens she\u2019s gonna have to try on multiple costumes, but I think she digs it,\u201d she teases.",
      "As far as other Halloween traditions go, Brown is \"team candy corn\" and loves to light pumpkin spice candles in her house. She prefers \"family-friendly\" Halloween flicks over horror films and loves carving both real and craft pumpkins.",
      "Halloween is one of Brown's favorite holidays, but she's also a fan of Christmas, calling the two celebrations \"equally magical.\" Still, she admits that Halloween has a leg up due to the costumes.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no shock as to why I\u2019ve been an actress my whole life because you get to become different characters on Halloween,\u201d she says.",
      "As she looks ahead to the premiere of \"Haul Out the Halloween,\" Brown is thrilled to be experiencing her favorite time of the year and tap into her inner child for the next few weeks.",
      "\"The wonder, the joy of Halloween, the excitement, the magic, it's all there and it's my favorite aspect of the season to still grab on to as much as possible,\" she says."

    "summary": "Why is TikTok talking about the rapture nonstop? A  Christian expert unpacks the rapture trend and what it means, plus what Joshua Mhlakela.",
    "story": [
      "Anyone scrolling through TikTok this week may be wondering what's fueling chatter about the Rapture.",
      "Videos with the hashtag #Rapture have gone viral in recent days, with some Christians stating Jesus Christ will return to Earth on Sept. 23 or 24 to collect true believers and bring them back to heaven with him. The event would mark the beginning of what some believers call the \"end times\" \u2014 or essentially, the end of human history.",
      "On the flip side, others are creating their own videos satirizing the idea of the Rapture. In other words, it's been a lively week on social media. Read on to learn what #RaptureTok is all about.",
      "What is the Rapture?",
      "\u201cRapture is a theological belief within some strands of Christianity,\" Malynda Hale, activist and executive director of the progressive Christian nonprofit the New Evangelicals, tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"They believe that all the good Christians that have given their life over to Jesus and declare him as their Lord and Savior will be taken up. Those who are not saved will remain on Earth to endure prolonged suffering,\" she continues.",
      "Some Christians, particularly evangelical Christians, believe the Bible predicts the rapture with the passage 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17. The passage describes a moment that believers are \"caught up together ... in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air,\" per the King James Bible.",
      "\"Not all sectors of Christianity believe it,\" Hale says, but adds the reason it's \"popular\" with American evangelicals is because of the faith's focus on the afterlife.",
      "\"The afterlife is what matters. That's eternity. That's where we are immortal. Earth is just a small blip,\" she summarizes.",
      "Why did people think the Rapture will happen on Sept. 23 and 24?",
      "The dates this week were predicted by Joshua Mhlakela, a man from South Africa interviewed in a video posted to the Centtwinz TV YouTube channel.",
      "\"The time of The Rapture is at hand,\" Mhlakela said in the June 2025 video.",
      "Mhlakela said that Jesus told him in a 2018 dream, \u201cOn the 23rd and the 24th of September, 2025, I will come to take my church.\u201d",
      "\"He says to me \u2014 another thing that I forgot \u2014 is, 'In these two days, no one knows which days, or which hour, I will come,\" he said. Mhlakela was emphatic: \"There are many dates out there, but the one that I'm telling you is the true one.\"",
      "He also predicted that the end of the world would come after the Rapture, and that Jesus would rule on Earth in September 2032. In a livestream on Sept. 23, Mhlakela stood by his predictions, saying \"everything in me knows\" he would not be here on Sept. 25.",
      "Hale isn't sure what about Mhlakela's predictions made them take off recently, but has a feeling it has to do with the dates' alignment Rosh Hashanah, or the Jewish New Year, which he pointed out in the initial prediction.",
      "Still, Hale says, \"I couldn't tell you what it was about him that has really made people kind of panic and believe that this is actually the one.\"",
      "Have other dates for the Rapture been predicted?",
      "The prophecy has since gone viral, with many sharing the video on social media \u2014 but, Hale points out, Mhlakela is hardly the first person to make such a prediction.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time that we\u2019ve had Rapture theology come to the forefront,\u201d Hale says.",
      "There\u2019s a long history of people predicting when the Rapture will happen, in fact. Countless people have shared their own predictions \u2014 on social media and otherwise \u2014 which are often based on visions, biblical interpretations and, sometimes, numerology.",
      "Take Harold Camping, for example. In 2005, the American radio broadcaster and evangelist relied on his own interpretation of the book of Genesis to predict the Rapture was coming in 2011, according to NBC News' reporting at the time. (Camping had previously predicted the event would occur on three different dates in 1994.)",
      "As for TikTok, as long as the platform has been active, believers have gathered to discuss the Rapture and other theological issues, even tackling the question of whether our pets get taken to heaven with us when the Rapture finally happens.",
      "What are people saying about the Rapture on TikTok?",
      "Some Christians on TikTok have shared videos filled with tips for other believers so they can be sure Jesus takes them home.",
      "\"The day of the lord is near, folks. Are you ready? Repent of your sins. Put your faith in Jesus,\" one user instructed viewers.",
      "An account called christwillreturn has posted several videos of believers happily waiting for Jesus Christ's return. Another account called christianquotes89 posted a video of two men sharing calm words to non-believers who will be left behind during the Rapture.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering, where did the missing people go? What\u2019s going on? I imagine you\u2019re pretty afraid and looking for answers,\u201d one of the men explains.",
      "He goes on to say he and others believers are now \"with Jesus.\"",
      "Others are stressed by the idea of the Rapture. One TikToker who spent an hour on RaptureTok cried at the thought of only having a few more days with her children.",
      "The \"actual logistics\" of the Rapture are \"terrifying\" to those who believe, Hale says. \"But for them, it's really like, 'I finally get to go be with Jesus. That's eternal life.'\"",
      "As of Sept. 24, the Rapture hasn't happened. \"I think it could leave people really disoriented,\" Hale says of the experience, adding that they could be \"spiritually shaken.\"",
      "\"I think it's very concerning that people aren't thinking about the ramifications of pushing this theory because they're so convinced it's the truth.\""

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is suddenly bullish when it comes to Ukraine\u2019s chances of repelling Russia\u2019s invasion and regaining all its territory, yet the shift in rhetoric means little unless he is prepared to ramp up pressure on the Kremlin, diplomats and foreign officials say.",
      "Thus far, Trump hasn\u2019t taken these essential steps, they added.",
      "Trump\u2019s social media post Tuesday upended the conventional thinking about his view of the war, now in its fourth year. Back in February, he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he didn\u2019t have the \u201ccards\u201d in a peace negotiation and that his country was in \u201cbig trouble.\u201d",
      "Now, Trump says that Russia is the one that is in \u201cbig economic trouble\u201d and that its failure to swiftly conquer its smaller neighbor has revealed it to be a \u201cpaper tiger.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,\u201d he wrote in his post Tuesday.",
      "\u201cRussia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThis is not distinguishing Russia.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s aim in releasing the statement was to exert \u201cmaximum public pressure on Russia to get them to the table for a deal\u201d to end the war, according to a senior Trump administration official.",
      "Next steps will depend on how Russia responds, said the official, who did not lay out any specific policy changes happening now.",
      "There are different ways to construe Trump\u2019s statement. One is that he\u2019s grown tired of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s persistence in shelling Ukraine and is prepared to step up coercive measures aimed at getting Russia to pull back.",
      "\u201cTrump concluded Putin is not interested in peace,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump confidant, said in an interview Wednesday. Calling Trump\u2019s post and his speech to the United Nations General Assembly a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d Graham added, \u201cThere was a belief in Moscow that Trump is on their side, but the president made it clear that Ukraine will have all it needs as long as it needs.\u201d"

      "A Palestinian state is getting a powerful new push.",
      "Dozens of world leaders gathered Monday to rally support for a two-state solution, with the United States and Israel set to boycott the summit as they find themselves increasingly isolated by a rising tide of traditional allies responding to Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron announced at the meeting at the United Nations on Monday that France is formally recognizing a Palestinian state.",
      "\u201cThe time has come. This is why, true to the historic, historic commitment of my country to the Middle East, to peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. This is why I declare that today, France recognizes the state of Palestine,\u201d he said.",
      "The summit, convened by France and Saudi Arabia, comes after the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal all announced their formal recognition of the state of Palestine on Sunday, with several other nations expected to follow suit at the United Nations General Assembly this week.",
      "These Western powers may be hoping to breathe new life into the idea as a way to resolve the conflict, but Israel's hard-line government has instead vowed to retaliate while pressing ahead with its deadly assault on Gaza City that has forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said both Israel and the U.S. would boycott Monday's summit, branding it a \"circus.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decried the moves as a \"huge reward to terrorism\" and vowed there \"will be no Palestinian state.\"",

      "Hopes for a two-state solution have dwindled in the midst of Israel's nearly two-year offensive in Gaza \u2014 and as efforts to negotiate a ceasefire to end the war and free the remaining hostages have repeatedly failed.",
      "Palestinian statehood, which would see an internationally recognized state in territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, is now formally recognized by around 75% of U.N. member countries. But that recognition remains largely symbolic.",
      "Gershon Baskin, an Israeli who has acted as a mediator with Hamas for decades and a staunch advocate of a two-state solution, said that he welcomed the growing recognition. But without further action, including sanctions against Israel, he said the move will do little to \"change the lives of Palestinians\" on the ground.",
      "\"It's really a step in the right direction,\" Baskin said in a phone interview Monday of the summit at the General Assembly. But, calling Israel's offensive in Gaza \"a genocide,\" he said, \"the most important thing now ... is to end the war in Gaza and that comes before everything else.\"",
      "It is unclear how effective Monday\u2019s summit will be in advancing efforts to end the war in the face of furious opposition from Israel and the U.S., which blocked Palestinian officials from even attending the U.N. gathering.",
      "Baskin noted the possibility of retaliation from Israel in response to the diplomatic moves by France, the U.K. and others, with far-right members of Netanyahu's government pushing for the annexation of part of the occupied West Bank.",
      "Speaking with the BBC ahead of Monday's summit, British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she had directly warned her Israeli counterpart against such a move.",
      "Baskin warned that any \"annexation steps by Israel, which would be illegal against international law\" would only result in further isolation of the country on the international stage.",
      "\u201cThis conflict has to be resolved \u2014 and the only way to resolve it is through the two-state solution,\u201d he said.",
      "Palestinians in the West Bank also welcomed the growing international recognition, but said more must be done.",
      "The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates said it \u201cwelcomes and thanks the countries that have recognized the State of Palestine,\u201d calling their decisions \u201ccourageous and consistent with international law and international legitimacy resolutions.\u201d",

      "By the time the White House clarified that existing holders of the H-1B visas for skilled workers were not affected, the chaos had already been sewn: U.S. allies expressed concern and their nationals abandoned holidays, business trips and plans to see their families as they raced back to America before the new rules took effect Sunday.",

      "\"There was certainly that flurry, because for organizations big and small, they would have to get that message out, and the earlier the better,\" she said.",

      "President Donald Trump has said he hopes to see Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan returned to U.S. control, suggesting a renewed American presence in the country now again ruled by the Taliban.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said of Bagram during a news conference Thursday alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that capped a whirlwind state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Taking aim at the Biden administration's fraught withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as a \"total disaster,\" Trump criticized the decision to relinquish Bagram Airfield, which quickly fell under the control of the Taliban as they swept back into power in 2021.",
      "\"We gave it to them for nothing,\" said Trump, who has long criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"We want that base back,\" he said.",
      "About an hour's drive north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, Bagram served for years as a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At its peak around 2012, the sprawling airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its compound.",
      "Late Thursday, Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Afghan Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of Bagram returning to the U.S.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan and the U.S. need to interact with each other and can have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and common interests,\u201d Jalaly said on the social platform X. \u201cThe Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the door is open for further interaction.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear at least one motivating factor for his interest in reclaiming Bagram, noting its proximity to rival superpower China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said during his comments Thursday, which came a day before he was spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade negotiations.",
      "Addressing journalists later on Air Force One, Trump said Bagram was \"one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,\" adding: \"You could land anything there.\" He emphasized again that the base was \"an hour away from where they make their missiles \u2014 China.\"",
      "Addressing Trump's comments Friday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China \"respects Afghanistan\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.",
      "\"Afghanistan\u2019s future should be decided by its own people,\" Lin said, adding: \"Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won\u2019t be popular.\"",
      "China, which has made strides in rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile, is estimated to have accumulated about 600 warheads, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "Of course, greater surveillance on China wouldn't be the only advantage to regaining Bagram.",
      "A presence at the base could also aid in regional counterterrorism efforts, among other factors that could appeal to Trump.",
      "It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the U.S. has been in talks with the Taliban on the future of Bagram.",
      "\u201cEven if the Taliban considered this, China most certainly would do everything it can to entice the Taliban to keep the U.S. out of Afghanistan and has far more leverage and enticements to make this happen,\" Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, cautioned in comments shared online Thursday.",
      "\"The Trump administration should be very careful not to grant the Taliban concessions only to be prevented access to Bagram in the end,\" he said.",
      "The Taliban have been working to rehabilitate their global standing, with the militant group freeing American George Glezmann, a Delta Air Lines mechanic, in March amid efforts to normalize relations between Afghanistan and the U.S.",
      "On Friday, the Taliban also released British couple Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband, Peter Reynolds, 80, who were detained by the Interior Ministry in February, according to Sky News, NBC News' sister outlet in the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump's comments came as the Pentagon continues to push ahead with a review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed at Kabul's airport in a bombing by the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "Trump, who began the process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during his first term, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration's handling of the drawdown.",
      "The White House under President Joe Biden largely blamed the Trump administration for the chaotic withdrawal, with a National Security Council report released in 2023 arguing that Biden's options for executing the operation were \"severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor.\""

      "Speculation had gone into overdrive prior to the announcement, with experts wondering whether Masaryk may have conveyed a fateful warning before Europe's descent back into war. His words are believed to have been dictated to his son Jan, surviving both World War II and subsequent communist rule.",
      "Jan\u2019s former secretary handed the envelope to the National Archives in 2005 on the condition that it not be opened for another 20 years.",
      "Even the Masaryk family did not know what mystery the white envelope contained. But when it was opened early Friday, it still managed to surprise.",
      "Inside was another yellow envelope, containing five pages of handwritten notes in Czech and English (Masaryk's wife, Charlotte Garrigue, was born in the United States.)",
      "Rather than a final message before his death in 1937, experts assessed that the message was instead dictated three years earlier.",
      "\u201cI am ill, seriously ill \u2014 it is the end, but I am not afraid. You will continue the work, you know how, but you must be careful. You know how to behave; I don\u2019t need to tell you anything more,\u201d the letter read, according to the country's official broadcaster.",

      "Masaryk became the first president of Czechoslovakia in 1918 after it declared independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was defeated in World War I. He served until 1935. Jan became foreign minister at the end of World War II, until his sudden death in 1948.",
      "In the envelope, Masaryk talked extensively about his death and subsequent funeral and reflected on the complex political situation in the ethnically diverse country.",
      "As well as derisive comments about a Slovak politician, he urged keeping the German minority part of the state. \u201cGive them what they deserve, but no more,\u201d he said of the Germans, according to the state broadcaster.",
      "\u201c[This was a] crucial time in Czechoslovakia with Hitler just coming to power in Germany,\u201d said Mark Cornwall, an emeritus professor of modern European history at the University of Southampton in England.",
      "\u201cIt was a very turbulent period in Europe about what was going to happen,\u201d said Cornwall, nodding to the Nazis' subsequent annexation of the Sudetenland, a Czech region that had a significant German-speaking population, and the later outbreak of World War II.",
      "\u201cMasaryk is still very revered\u201d in the country, Cornwall told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an American equivalent. Perhaps he\u2019s George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.\u201d"

      "The Israeli airstrikes that killed 31 journalists and media support workers in Yemen earlier this month were the second-deadliest attack ever on the press, according to a report by the Committee to Protect Journalists, a global watchdog.",
      "At least 35 people were reported killed during the Sept. 10 bombings that struck residential areas, a military headquarters and a gas station, according to the health ministry in the rebel-held northern part of the country.",
      "Two media outlets, 26 September and Yemen newspaper, are located in the government's Moral Guidance Directorate\u2019s headquarters, said the CPJ.",
      "Nasser al Khadri, editor-in-chief of 26 September, described the killings as an \u201cunprecedented massacre of journalists,\u201d telling the CPJ that his offices were hit in the afternoon.",
      "Both outlets are under the control of the Iran-backed Houthis, who say they are supporting Hamas and the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

      "Israel has emerged as \u201ca regional killer of journalists, with repeated incidents in Gaza, Lebanon, Iran, and now Yemen confirming Israel\u2019s longstanding pattern of labeling journalists as terrorists or propagandists to justify their killings,\u201d said CPJ's regional program director, Sara Qudah.",
      "CPJ, which distinguishes journalists from other media workers, said it has determined that at least nine of the 31 who worked for the two media outlets are journalists, and is still investigating details on other press members.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied targeting journalists.",
      "When asked for comment on the killing of journalists and media workers, the IDF referred NBC News to a statement issued after the strike, in which it accused the Houthis' \"public relations department\" of leading \"propaganda efforts\" and \"psychological terror.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said the strikes were a response to the repeated Houthi attacks and followed a drone launched by the Houthis that breached Israel\u2019s multilayered air defenses and slammed into an airport in the south.",
      "The Houthis, a religious and military group that controls most of Yemen\u2019s northwest including the capital, Sanaa, have been launching missiles and drones at Israel since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led terrorist attacks in Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza.",
      "The war in Gaza has been one of the bloodiest for media workers, and reporters across the Middle East have come under fire as tensions spill beyond the strip.",

      "The Foreign Press Association, which represents international media in Israel and the Palestinian territories, has also called on Israel \u201cto halt its abhorrent practice of targeting journalists.\u201d",
      "Israeli forces have killed so many journalists that Reuters has stopped sharing the locations of its teams in the Gaza Strip with the country\u2019s military, the international news agency told NBC News in August.",
      "The deadliest attack on the press recorded by the CPJ was the 2009 Maguindanao massacre in the Philippines, in which 32 journalists were among those killed when a convoy was ambushed."

      "Early this month, moviegoers who attended preview screenings said on Chinese social media that one of two men shown getting married in the film was digitally altered into a woman, most likely with AI.",

      "Written and directed by Australian filmmaker Michael Shanks, the movie tells the story of a couple, played by American actors Alison Brie and Dave Franco, who move to the countryside to save their relationship and encounter a mysterious force that draws them closer.",
      "Hishow offered the first pre-release screenings in 11 Chinese cities starting Sept. 12, with the movie scheduled to be released nationwide on Sept. 19.",

      "The state-owned China Film Group Corporation said last week that the wide release of \u201cTogether\u201d had been postponed due to \u201ca change in the film\u2019s distribution plan,\u201d without offering further details.",
      "\u201cThe specific new date will be announced once it is confirmed,\u201d it said.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Hishow and Neon for comment.",
      "Though imported films are often edited by Chinese censors to cut scenes deemed too sensitive or risqu\u00e9, this appears to be among the first instances of technology being used to change a scene instead.",
      "One of the biggest subjects of censorship is homosexuality, which despite being decriminalized in China has been the target of a government crackdown in recent years, even though surveys shows the public is increasingly supportive of LGBTQ people.",
      "In 2021, Chinese authorities banned \u201ceffeminate\u201d behavior from screens, and fans complained in 2022 when they noticed the removal of an LGBTQ storyline from the TV sitcom \u201cFriends,\u201d which is highly popular in China. At least 10 scenes with gay references were also dropped from the Chinese version of the 2018 biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d about the rock musician and Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.",
      "The alteration of the \u201cTogether\u201d wedding scene \u201csignifies that the government has a clear stance, and they have a red line,\u201d Jason Coe, who teaches courses on film and media studies at the University of Hong Kong, told NBC News. \u201cThey will look to enforce it, and they will find innovative ways to enforce it.\u201d",
      "Zeng Hong, an assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film, agreed that the apparent use of AI in \u201cTogether\u201d is not \u201clooking promising for LGBTQ rights as well as their representation on Chinese screens.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has demanded an investigation into what he called a \u201ctriple sabotage\u201d at the United Nations General Assembly, including his allegation that an escalator was deliberately halted while he and first lady Melania Trump were riding it.",
      "The U.N. says the escalator was likely stopped when a White House videographer accidentally triggered a safety mechanism. Nonetheless, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres' office said late Wednesday that it had ordered a \"thorough investigation\" into the three incidents mentioned by Trump, and was \"ready to cooperate in full transparency\" to find out what caused them.",
      "That came after Trump posted a 358-word complaint on Truth Social detailing \u201cthree very sinister events.\u201d",
      "Aside from the escalator issue, he saw malice in faults with his teleprompter and audio during his speech to the assembly, in which he had initially made light of the issues and told Western nations \u201cyour countries are going to hell\u201d over immigration.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey ought to be ashamed of themselves. I\u2019m sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary General, and I demand an immediate investigation.\u201d",
      "In what has become a fraught back-and-forth between the White House and General Assembly, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, detailed the sequence of events that caused the travellator to halt.",
      "\"A readout of the machine's central processing unit indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism\" was \"triggered at the top of the escalator,\" likely by the White House videographer who had boarded before the president and first lady, Dujarric said. That safety mechanism \"is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing,\" he said.",
      "That did not appear to satisfy Trump, who described the escalator as coming to a \u201cscreeching halt.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt stopped on a dime. It\u2019s amazing that Melania and I didn\u2019t fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster.\u201d",
      "He referenced reporting in Britain\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper, which had said that U.N. staff had been overheard joking about turning off the building\u2019s escalators and elevators to highlight a funding shortfall caused by White House cuts. This reporting has not been confirmed by NBC News.",

      "LONDON \u2014 The mayor of London has labeled Donald Trump \"racist, sexist and Islamophobic\" after the president used a United Nations General Assembly address to call him a \"terrible mayor\" and falsely claim the city wanted to be governed by Islamic law.",
      "\"I think Donald Trump has shown he is racist, he is sexist, he is misogynistic and he's Islamophobic,\" Sadiq Khan told reporters Wednesday.",
      "The pair have traded many barbed comments since Khan was elected to lead London in 2016 \u2014 Khan strongly criticized the president the same year for pledging a travel ban on a number of majority-Muslim countries, which was enacted in 2017. Trump called the Londoner and former member of Parliament \"a nasty person\" in a July news conference.",
      "\"I think people are wondering what it is about this Muslim mayor who leads a liberal, multicultural, progressive, successful city that means I appear to be living in Donald Trump's head, rent free,\" Khan said.",

      "\"I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it's been changed, it's been so changed,\" he said. \"Now they want to go to Sharia law. But you are in a different country, you can't do that.\"",
      "Initially, Khan's team at City Hall released a statement saying: \"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response.\"",
      "But Wednesday, speaking from the top deck of a London bus, Khan said he was thankful for the \"record numbers of Americans\" coming to live in London, which he said was the highest since records began. \"There must be a reason for that,\" he said.",
      "Khan's pointed criticism was in contrast to the approach taken by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Last week saw King Charles III and Starmer welcome Trump and first lady Melania Trump for a lavish state visit \u2014 an unprecedented second official trip to Britain for a sitting president.",
      "Particularly after Trump launched a global trade war, with tariffs impacting scores of close allies including the United Kingdom, very few world officials have seemed willing to so openly criticize the president or his policies.",
      "Asked whether Britain should be extending such friendship to Trump, Khan said: \"If you have a best friend, you should expect more from them \u2014 it's very different to an acquaintance or somebody who's a distant friend.\"",
      "While he said the U.K. and the U.S. have important economic and military ties, Khan said such a relationship should mean one side has the confidence to call out the other. \"I think that President Trump is wrong in many, many ways,\" he said.",
      "Davis Ingle, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement: \u201cMayor Khan clearly suffers from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome and has done a terrible job as mayor. His ridiculous open border and unchecked immigration policies have allowed violent crime to run rampant in his city.\u201d",
      "Khan, who represents Britain's Labour Party and is characterized as being on the center-left, social democratic wing of the party, won a third third term in office in 2024.",
      "The prevalence of Sharia law in the U.K. features in many right-wing conspiracy theories about the role of Muslims in the country, often partnered with the similarly false assertion that parts of big cities are dangerous \"no-go areas\" for non-Muslims.",
      "In reality, there are Sharia councils, which base decisions on traditional Muslim beliefs and religious texts, but they have no legal jurisdiction \u2014 as a government review found in 2018.",
      "Anger persists over the president's comments about London: Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour lawmaker who now represents Khan's old constituency in south London, has called for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. to be summoned over the remarks."

      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian lashed out at the U.S and Israel for their attacks in June during a speech at the United Nations on Wednesday, one day after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the country, ruled out talks with President Donald Trump about Iran's nuclear program.",
      "\u201cThe aerial assaults of [Israel] and the United States of America against Iran\u2019s cities, homes and infrastructure, precisely at a time when we were treading the path of diplomatic negotiations, constituted a grave betrayal of diplomacy and a subversion of efforts towards the establishment of stability and peace,\u201d he said.",
      "At the podium, Pezeshkian held up a book with the words \u201cKilled By Israel\u201d printed on the front and leafed through pages with pictures of families and children.",
      "There have been calls among moderates in Iran for direct talks with Trump, but on Tuesday Khamenei rejected negotiations with the U.S. about the country's nuclear program and in many ways set the parameters of what Pezeshkian could discuss in New York.",
      "\u201cIn my view, negotiating with America about the nuclear issue and maybe other issues is an absolute dead end,\u201d Khamenei said in an address, adding that Iran would not stop uranium enrichment because it would not be acceptable to the people of the country, according to his official website.",
      "He added, \u201cThis negotiation will be beneficial for the current American president. He will hold his head high, say I threatened Iran and I brought them to the negotiating table. He will be proud of this in the world. But for us it\u2019s an absolute loss and has no benefit.\u201d",
      "Khamenei also said on Tuesday that Iran does not intend to build a nuclear weapon, a point that Pezeshkian highlighted in his speech Wednesday, and that it will not negotiate on its ballistic missile program.",
      "But a White House official told NBC News on Wednesday that the U.S. is still open to talks with Iran. \u201cIran continues to defy its nuclear commitments. The United States is fully coordinated with our E3 partners and stands firm in holding Iran accountable,\u201d the official said. The E3 is a reference to Britain, France and Germany.",
      "The official added, \u201cAt the same time, the United States remains available for direct engagement with Iran \u2014 in furtherance of a peaceful, enduring resolution to the Iran nuclear issue.\u201d",
      "Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Wednesday that Iran is in a tough position and that the administration wants to negotiate with it, according to Reuters.",
      "\"We're talking to them,\" Witkoff said when asked if there is a diplomatic path forward with Iran.",
      "But the hard line drawn by Khamenei against talks with Trump about the nuclear issue could significantly ramp up tensions with the U.S. and Israel.",
      "The value of the Iranian rial against the U.S. dollar hit a record low Wednesday after Khamenei\u2019s remarks.",
      "Moderate voices in Iran pushing for direct talks with the U.S. were hoping to stave off more devastating attacks on the country by either the Israeli or U.S. military, which pummeled the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites in late June with airstrikes, including the first combat use of massive \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs.",
      "Trump, addressing the United Nations on Tuesday, said the attacks had targeted \u201cIran\u2019s key nuclear facility, totally obliterating everything.\u201d But analysts have raised questions about the extent of the damage caused by the attacks and the whereabouts of the approximately 880 pounds of enriched uranium that Iran is thought to have produced.",
      "The Israeli attacks, which Israeli officials said were intended to stop the Islamic Republic from obtaining a nuclear weapon, also hammered nuclear targets but expanded to include energy infrastructure and even the country's notorious Evin prison, and killed more than 1,000 people, according to state media.",
      "Even if Iran does not talk to the U.S. directly, Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, only have until Sep. 27 to negotiate a diplomatic solution with Britain, France and Germany before they face a \u201csnapback\u201d of sanctions. Negotiated under the 2015 nuclear deal, the snapback would lead to an arms embargo, freezing of assets outside the country and restrictions on enriching uranium, among other penalties.",
      "The sanctions could hit at a time when the country is reeling from an economic crisis, which critics blame on current sanctions as well as corruption and mismanagement.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron met with Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting in New York on Wednesday and posted on X that a diplomatic solution to avoid snapback could still be reached if Iran allows full access to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, is transparent about its stockpile of enriched materials and resumes negotiations.",
      "\"An agreement remains possible. Only a few hours are left,\" Macron wrote. \"It is up to Iran to respond to the legitimate conditions we have set.\"",
      "After meeting with Macron, Pezeshkian also said that an agreement is possible in a post on X.",
      "\"If there is a commitment to fairness and what is right and ensuring the interests of both sides then a definite solution is within reach,\" he wrote.",
      "In recent months, Pezeshkian has been fighting for his political, and actual, life. He narrowly escaped an Israeli attack on a meeting of top officials in June, and his conservative critics have pressed him hard on the economy as well as restrictions on social freedoms.",
      "Security forces kicked off a massive crackdown during and after the war. The crackdown was ostensibly to ferret out spies, but in many cases the security forces used the war as a pretext to detain ethnic and religious minorities as well as Afghan migrants, according to Amnesty International. A police spokesman said in mid-August that 21,000 people had been arrested in the 12-day period of the war and observers say that more arrests have subsequently taken place and pending executions have been expedited.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re targeting already marginalized groups even further, and that\u2019s one way for them to exert and show the control that they have and try to retain their power while also instilling fear in the population,\u201d said Nassim Papayianni, an Iran campaigner at Amnesty International. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about scapegoating. So essentially they are trying to use the conflict as a way to ramp up the crackdown and the arrests.\u201d",
      "With Pezeshkian\u2019s hands tied on the international stage by the supreme leader and his hard-line opponents pressing a crackdown on real and perceived enemies at home, the Iranian president appears more isolated than at any point since assuming his position last year."

      "He added that Israel would not allow the flotilla to \u201center an active combat zone and will not allow the breach of a lawful naval blockade.\u201d",
      "Marmorstein also called for the flotilla to dock at Israel\u2019s Ashkelon Marina and unload aid there for it to be transferred to Gaza.",
      "But GSF has argued that Israel is violating international law in Gaza, rendering its blockade illegal.",
      "The flotilla, which is carrying more than 500 people from more than 40 countries, set sail from Barcelona late last month in a bid to \u201cbreak the illegal siege of Gaza.\u201d",
      "Gaza has been under an Israeli naval blockade since 2007, when Hamas took power.",
      "GSF said this month that two of its boats had been attacked by drones while it was stationed in Tunisia.",
      "The Tunisian Interior Ministry said at the time that reports that a drone hit a boat at its Sidi Bou Said port had \u201cno basis in truth\u201d and that a fire broke out on the vessel itself, according to Reuters.",
      "Israeli forces continue their devastating assault on Gaza City, where scores of people have been killed in recent days and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Deaths from starvation have also continued to rise, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks in 2023, when 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, Palestinian health officials say, more than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, while much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble.",
      "This week, Tom Barrack, the U.S. special envoy to Syria and ambassador to Turkey, accused Israel of \u201cattacking everybody\u201d in an interview with The National, the state-owned English-language daily newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 You'd forgive Ukrainians double-checking their Truth Social feeds.",
      "There was a mix of astonishment and reservation in Kyiv on Wednesday \u2014 contrasted with bitter dismissal and some mocking defiance in Moscow \u2014 after President Donald Trump said Ukraine could reclaim all of its territory, a dramatic change in rhetoric on the war.",
      "The Kremlin rejected Trump\u2019s description of Russia as a \u201cpaper tiger,\u201d saying its military was advancing and its economy stable rather than suffering \"big\" problems as the president suggested. But in Ukraine, the sudden reversal was greeted cautiously as a welcome shift from the U.S. leader that still left much to be answered.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly insisted that giving up territory to Russia in a peace deal was not an option, and hailed the \u201cbig shift\u201d in Trump\u2019s position after meeting with him in New York.",

      "\"But in the end, peace depends on all of us,\" he said.",
      "Trump had long maintained that an end to the war would require Ukraine ceding territory, but months of failed diplomacy have seemingly fueled frustrations with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"I was almost amazed to hear it from him, it was powerful,\" Maryna Lozova, 32, said. \"But there is one huge \u201cbut\u201d \u2014 we should definitely remember how often he changes his mind, and how crazy some of his ideas are,\" the housewife in Kyiv told NBC News.",
      "Others were similarly reluctant to celebrate given what they saw as a number of recent U-turns on the subject, as Trump first welcomed Putin to Alaska, then met with Zelenskyy and European leaders, each time leaving his guests feeling positive about their efforts.",
      "\u201cI would like to believe in deeds, not words,\u201d said Volodymyr Rzhavskyy, a 44-year-old entrepreneur from the front-line Donetsk region. He called on Trump to \u201cprovide Ukraine with maximum opportunity to regain its territorial integrity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that if we really are provided with enough weapons and the support we need, then we have the opportunity to return our land,\u201d he said.",
      "Lozova said she knew \"for sure, that Ukraine can return the territories,\" and was thankful that \u201cfinally, someone recognizes this and does not question it.\u201d",
      "But she pointed to Trump's comment in his lengthy Truth Social post that it was with help from Europe and NATO, not the U.S., that Ukraine might retake its land. \"That raises some questions,\" she said.",

      "The idea that Ukraine can \"win back something is, from our point of view, an erroneous talking point,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Russia was not a paper tiger, he said in an earlier radio interview, but \"more often associated with a bear. And paper bears don\u2019t exist.\"",
      "Russia currently controls roughly 19% of Ukraine following its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022, according to open source maps of the battlefield cited by Reuters. Peskov claimed its advance may be slow in a deliberate bid to minimize casualties.",
      "\u201cOf course, President Trump heard Zelenskyy\u2019s version of events. And apparently at this point, this version is the reason for the assessment we heard,\u201d Peskov said.",

      "A call between world leaders is usually a carefully choreographed event reserved for talk of war and peace. France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron used his hotline to President Donald Trump to complain about New York traffic.",
      "After he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday night, Macron found himself stuck behind a police barricade while he was trying to reach his country\u2019s diplomatic mission in the city. Whereas regular folk may have sat patiently or taken to social media to vent their fury, Macron put aside any tension over their dueling stances on Israel's war in Gaza and dialed his friend in the White House.",
      "\u201cHow are you?\u201d Macron was recorded saying into his cellphone. \u201cGuess what? I\u2019m waiting in the street because everything is frozen for you!\u201d",
      "He then tried to use their traffic chat as an excuse to discuss weightier matters.",
      "\u201cI would love this weekend have a short discussion with Qatar and you on the situation in Gaza,\u201d Macron said.",
      "An official traveling with Macron told NBC News that Macron \u201ctook the opportunity to call Donald Trump on the phone while walking, for a very warm and friendly conversation that allowed them to discuss several international issues.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t possible to hear Trump\u2019s responses. The White House for comment didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "He wasn\u2019t the only world leader to suffer such a traffic-related indignity. Earlier in the day, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was also seen held up at the barriers.",
      "French media reported that Macron was soon able to complete his journey to the consulate.",
      "Beneath the minor traffic-related indignity, there was genuine friction between the two leaders this week. Macron had just announced that France would become the latest country to recognize Palestinian statehood \u2014 something Trump decried as a reward for Hamas' terrorist attack of Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "\"I think it honors Hamas, and you can't do that because of Oct. 7. You just can't do that,\" Trump told reporters as he sat next to Macron on Tuesday.",

      "\"There is one person who can do something about it, and that is the U.S. president,\" he told France's BFMTV. \"And the reason he can do more than us is because we do not supply weapons that allow the war in Gaza to be waged. We do not supply equipment that allows war to be waged in Gaza. The United States of America does.\"",
      "Echoing the nuanced nature of their relationship, Trump did also say that Macron was \u201cdoing a really good job. He\u2019s fighting hard. He\u2019s fighting on a lot of fronts. He\u2019s helping with regard to the Russia, Ukraine catastrophe. And his words of wisdom mean a lot.\" He added, \"We\u2019ve been friends for a long time now, really from the first term on.\u201d",
      "France is the latest European country to formally recognize Palestine as a state, joining the United Kingdom and adding to a growing list of global nations that now numbers more than 145. The United States, Germany, Italy, Japan and a handful of others are firmly in the minority.",
      "Macron has sought to cast himself as a Trump-whisperer who can act as a counterweight to him: someone who gets on with Trump personally but is unafraid to stand up for European interests when the need arises.",
      "Nevertheless, their relationship has blown hot and cold.",
      "Personal interactions have been characterized by uncomfortably long handshakes and macho knee-slapping. And in June, Trump branded Macron as a \u201cpublicity-seeking\u201d leader who \u201calways gets it wrong\u201d after Macron made comments about his counterpart\u2019s decision to leave the Group of 7 summit in Canada early.",

      "Saad Almadi, 75, was found guilty of distributing online content that undermines public order, according to a Sept. 14 ruling provided by his son. The conviction, which has not been previously reported, carries a three-year sentence but spares Almadi additional prison time after he spent more than a year behind bars following his arrest in 2021.",
      "Instead, it blocks Almadi from leaving the kingdom until March. The Saudi government, which did not respond to a request for comment, doesn\u2019t recognize dual citizenship and regularly rejects criticism of its actions, saying they are part of a multiyear crackdown on corruption, terrorism and other security threats.",
      "The ruling comes after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave a lavish welcome to President Donald Trump during a May trip to Saudi Arabia, a key strategic partner of the United States. It built on efforts to reengage with the kingdom after the crown prince\u2019s reputation was badly damaged by a U.S. intelligence determination that he had likely ordered the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Prince Mohammed denies his involvement.",
      "Son believes ruling looks to keep his father quiet",

      "\u201cThe government keeps changing its mind, and there\u2019s no consequences every time it does,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "A retired project manager who immigrated to the U.S. in the 1970s, the elder Almadi was arrested upon his arrival in Saudi Arabia for what was supposed to be a short trip to see family. Officials confronted him with tweets he had posted over the past several years, including one about Khashoggi\u2019s killing and another on the crown prince\u2019s consolidation of power, his family says.",
      "Almadi was quickly sentenced to more than 19 years in prison on terrorism-related charges stemming from the tweets. Saudi Arabia freed him after more than a year and dropped the terrorism charges but imposed an exit ban that keeps him from returning to his home in Boca Raton, near Miami.",
      "The Associated Press reported in January that Saudi officials were pressuring the elder Almadi to renounce his American citizenship",
      "Trump, who has made freeing Americans held by foreign adversaries a top priority, has remained mostly silent. When asked by a reporter in May about the case, he said he didn\u2019t know about it but promised to take a look. A few weeks later, one of his national security aides, Sebastian Gorka, met with the younger Almadi at the White House.",
      "The U.S. State Department said it is monitoring the elder Almadi\u2019s case, providing him with appropriate consular services and has been in contact with his family, but it declined to provide further comment, citing privacy considerations. The White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump deepens ties with Saudi Arabia",
      "Trump, since returning to the White House, has intensified an effort started during the Biden administration to bury any criticism of the Saudi royals over allegations of their involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.",
      "During his visit to Riyadh in May, Trump described Prince Mohammed as an \u201cincredible man\u201d and \u201cmy friend.\u201d Trump\u2019s family has extensive business dealings with the world\u2019s top oil exporter, which have only deepened since voters returned him to the White House.",
      "In April, the Trump Organization struck a deal with a developer close to the Saudi royal family, London-based Dar Global, to build a Trump-branded beachside villa and 18-hole golf course in neighboring Qatar. The Trump Organization also is partnering with the firm in a luxury high-rise apartment building in the coastal city of Jeddah, a project that was announced last December.",
      "A private equity firm controlled by Trump\u2019s son-in-law and former White House adviser Jared Kushner received a $2 billion investment from the sovereign wealth fund controlled by the crown prince.",
      "Abdullah Alaoudh, a senior director at the Middle East Democracy Center, a Washington-based human rights group, is tracking cases of Americans under exit bans in Saudi Arabia. He said he knew of four others \u2014 an American citizen, two dual U.S.-Saudi nationals and a U.S. green-card holder \u2014 facing a similar plight to Almadi\u2019s.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Health officials across the globe on Tuesday rejected President Donald Trump's warning that pregnant women should limit the use of acetaminophen over unsubstantiated claims of a link to autism.",
      "Authorities from Australia to Europe moved swiftly to respond to the U.S. announcement, which Trump made with great fanfare while flanked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t take Tylenol. Don\u2019t take it. Fight like hell not to take it,\u201d Trump said.",
      "But a range of experts worldwide noted there was not conclusive evidence to support the possible association between autism and acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol and other widely used medications \u2014 and no new evidence to warrant a change in guidance.",
      "\u201cAvailable evidence has found no link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism,\u201d said the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Paracetamol is a widely used name for Tylenol beyond the U.S.",
      "The EMA said it would not be making changes to the region\u2019s current recommendations, maintaining that pregnant women should take the lowest effective dose of the drug for the shortest possible time and as infrequently as possible.",
      "\u201cA large amount of data from pregnant women who used paracetamol during pregnancy indicates no risk of malformations on the developing fetus or on newborns,\u201d the EMA said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "The World Health Organization said that \u201cthe evidence remains inconsistent\u201d regarding any link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and autism.",
      "WHO spokesperson Tarik Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 cited unspecified studies that pointed to a possible link but said that this was not confirmed by subsequent research. \u201cThis lack of replicability really calls for caution in drawing casual conclusions,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump on Monday also suggested that additives in vaccines may cause autism, which the WHO was similarly quick to dispute.",
      "\u201cWe know that vaccines do not cause autism. Vaccines, as I said, save countless lives. So, this is something that science has proven, and these things should not be really questioned,\u201d Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 told a Geneva press briefing.",
      "Australian health officials were among the first to reject the claims, labeling them \u201ca misrepresentation of the science.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, together with the country\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, said Tuesday that it was joining other global medicines regulators in repudiating Trump\u2019s claims.",
      "\u201cRobust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims,\u201d they said in a statement.",
      "A number of other countries restated their existing guidance, which differs from the new warning issued by the Trump administration.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Health reiterated that its guidance had not changed, describing paracetamol as \u201cthe safest medicine to take in pregnancy\" for treatment of pain or fever.",
      "A spokesperson for the German Health Ministry told NBC News that there was no link between taking paracetamol during pregnancy and developmental abnormalities. \"In certain situations, taking medication is necessary to avoid endangering the mother and unborn child, for example in the case of high fever,\" they said in an emailed statement.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s health regulator, MHRA, issued a similar statement, stressing that \u201cparacetamol remains the recommended pain relief option for pregnant women when used as directed.\u201d",
      "\u201cUntreated pain and fever can pose risks to the unborn baby, so it is important to manage these symptoms with the recommended treatment,\u201d Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said in a statement on the agency\u2019s website.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting told ITV early Tuesday: \u201cI would just say to people watching, don\u2019t pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine.\u201d",
      "Spain\u2019s health minister, M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez, also called out Trump by name, accusing him of \u201cignoring all medical studies.\u201d",
      "\u201cDenialism not only destroys trust in science: it puts lives at risk,\u201d she wrote on X on Monday.",
      "Scott White, chair of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Women\u2019s Health Committee, said he was \"worried\" about the messaging from the U.S.",
      "\u201cParacetamol is safe and actually important to use because pain and fever are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes themselves,\u201d White told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really worried about the messaging that says pregnant women should just tough it out, that pregnant women should be denied access to pain relief, which is a fundamental human right. It\u2019s every woman\u2019s right,\u201d White said.",
      "\u201cTo suggest that women can\u2019t access a medication that we feel has been shown to be safe simply because they\u2019re pregnant women, is misogynistic.\u201d",
      "White cited a study published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association that studied 2.5 million children in Sweden. It compared siblings and found no association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability.",
      "While other studies have suggested some kind of link, including research published last month that Trump administration officials are citing, White argues many struggled to exclude factors like genetics or environment.",
      "Outside autism researchers have said that literature review, by researchers from Harvard and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, wasn\u2019t rigorously conducted and that it cherry-picked studies that supported its conclusion.",
      "White also said the reason a woman is taking paracetamol, such as to treat a fever or infection, could be what affects the mental development of the child.",
      "\u201cWe know that women who\u2019ve got complicated pregnancies in some way are more likely to go on to have babies that are neurodevelopmentally impacted,\u201d he added, citing fever as a prime example."

      "BEIJING \u2014 Washington and Beijing will have to communicate better if they are to resolve their various disagreements \u2014 and if they don\u2019t talk, it could be \u201cdangerous,\u201d a U.S. lawmaker said Tuesday during a rare congressional visit to China.",
      "This is the first delegation of House lawmakers to visit China since 2019; a group of U.S. senators visited Beijing in 2023. Their trip comes amid tensions between the United States and China over trade, technology and wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the leader of the bipartisan delegation, said that they held \u201crobust and very helpful\u201d meetings with Chinese officials and that the objective of the trip was to reopen lines of communication between \u201cthe two most powerful countries in the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur relationship is going to be the most consequential relationship in terms of what the world is going to be like for decades to come,\u201d Smith told reporters at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. \u201cIt is really important that we work to strengthen that relationship and better understand each other.\u201d",
      "The military relationship between the United States and China is of particular concern, he said.",
      "The congressional delegation arrived weeks after Beijing showed off its military might and advanced weaponry in a highly choreographed parade.",
      "\u201cChina is the most rapidly growing military and the most rapidly growing nuclear power in the world. The U.S. has the biggest military in the world and the biggest nuclear arsenal,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt is dangerous for us not to be having regular communications about our capabilities and intentions.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke Friday in their first phone call since June. Trump said that they agreed during the call to meet on the sidelines of the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 APEC Summit in South Korea and that he would visit China early next year.",
      "David Perdue, the new U.S. ambassador to China, said the two leaders had a \u201cgreat call\u201d and were \u201clooking forward to getting together.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that the relationship between President Xi and President Trump is actually very good and very encouraging right now,\u201d he said.",
      "The other members of the delegation are Reps. Michael Baumgartner, R-Wash.; Ro Khanna, D-Calif.; and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa. They are in China until Thursday.",
      "After they arrived Sunday, the lawmakers met with Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s No. 2 official. On Monday, they met with Vice Premier He Lifeng, who has been leading the Chinese side in trade negotiations with the United States, and Defense Minister Dong Jun.",
      "In their meeting with He, the delegation discussed the talks with China, which accounts for the largest U.S. trade deficit, and urged Beijing \u201cto help stem the flow of fentanyl to the U.S. and reduce non-tariff barriers to U.S. companies seeking to do business in China,\u201d according to a congressional readout.",
      "The delegation also discussed the future of the video app TikTok, which faces a ban in the United States unless its Chinese parent company sells its U.S. assets to U.S. owners, as well as the issue of critical minerals and the export controls Beijing has sought to impose on them as it leverages its near-monopoly in the industry.",
      "In their meeting with Dong, the lawmakers stressed the importance of greater communication between the U.S. and Chinese militaries to avoid miscalculation and conflict.",
      "Communications between the militaries were suspended starting in August 2022 after Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, angered Beijing by visiting Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy that China claims as its territory. They were restored in November 2023 after a meeting in the United States between Xi and President Joe Biden.",
      "The lawmakers visiting China said that the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific \u201cshould not be construed as a threat to China,\u201d that they sought a peaceful resolution to the issue of Taiwan and that conflict between the United States and China \u201cshould not be inevitable.\u201d",
      "Speaking before their meeting, Dong said the visit \u201cshows a good phase in strengthening China-U.S. communications, and I believe it is the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing and Jennifer Jett from Hong Kong."

    "summary": "U.S. allies called an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday after a series of incidents raised alarm about Russian threats to NATO.",
    "story": [
      "Drones over Poland. Fighter jets above Estonia. Surveillance planes over the Baltic Sea.",
      "To U.S. allies in Europe, the pattern is unmistakable: A deliberate campaign of escalation from the Kremlin, designed to probe NATO\u2019s defenses and political resolve.",
      "The question hanging over an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday is how exactly the alliance will respond.",
      "As NATO struggles to turn alarm into action, officials and analysts urged a more forceful response and warned that hesitation risks emboldening  Russian President Vladimir Putin. But questions about U.S. support, escalation risks and what this growing threat means for Ukraine remain unresolved.",
      "Estonia, which called for the Security Council meeting after three Russian MiG-31 fighter aircraft entered its airspace for 12 minutes without permission last week, pressed members to address what it described as a \u201cblatant, reckless, and flagrant violation of NATO airspace\u201d and Russia\u2019s \u201crepeated violations of international law.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s actions \u201cundermine principles vital to the security of all U.N. member states,\u201d Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said Sunday on X.",
      "Claims that Russia violated Estonian airspace were \"baseless\" and \"aimed at escalating tensions,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, adding that Russia operated within international regulations.",
      "So far, NATO\u2019s response has largely been limited to meeting rooms as Moscow's probing exposes a contrast between European leaders\u2019 urgent calls for action and President Donald Trump\u2019s more muted response.",
      "Asked by reporters Sunday whether Washington would come to the defense of Poland and the Baltic states if Russia attacks, Trump said: \"Yeah I would.\"",
      "And on Monday Mike Walz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said at Security Council meeting that the events left \u201cthe impression either Russia wants to escalate or doesn\u2019t have full control of its fighter planes and drones.\u201d Either scenario, he said, was \u201cvery disconcerting.\u201d",
      "The U.S. \u201cwill defend every inch of NATO territory,\u201d he said, adding that he expected \u201cRussia to seek ways to de escalate, not risk expansion.\u201d",
      "At the same meeting, Britain\u2019s foreign minister, Yvette Cooper, also warned that Russia\u2019s incursions into NATO territory risked triggering an armed conflict.",
      "\u201cYour reckless actions risk direct armed confrontation between NATO and Russia. Our alliance is defensive, but be under no illusion: We stand ready to defend NATO\u2019s skies and NATO\u2019s territory,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we need to confront planes operating in NATO space without permission then we will do so.\u201d",
      "That drew an immediate rebuke from Moscow, which dismissed Europe\u2019s concerns as groundless and hysterical.",
      "NATO's response to this ratcheting Russian activity amounts to the launch of operation \"Eastern Sentry\" earlier this month to bolster the defense of Europe\u2019s eastern flank in response to a series of Russian drone incursions over Poland.",
      "After Germany and Sweden scrambled fighter jets Sunday to intercept and track a Russian surveillance plane flying unidentified over the Baltic Sea, one regional leader said Russia was not just testing NATO\u2019s response, but was also aiming to reduce support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources.",
      "Calibrating how to respond to Russia was not easy, Latvian President Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds said on social media, adding that Russia was doing just enough not to cross a red line.",
      "European confidence about backing from Washington has been shaken by Ukraine, where Trump has so far stopped short of imposing his promised punishment of further sanctions on the Kremlin for refusing peace talks.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he was preparing for an \u201cintense week\u201d at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, where he hopes to build support for efforts to stop Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, said in a post on Telegram on Monday that he spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the leadup to an \"important meeting\" between Zelenskyy and Trump.",
      "\"We discussed the preparation of security guarantees for Ukraine, as well as the expansion of cooperation in the military, defense, and economic spheres,\" he wrote in the post.",
      "Ukraine has also submitted a request to attend the Security Council meeting and present its position.",
      "But Europe's security will require decisive action, and that will not happen at a Security Council meeting, \u201cfor the very simple reason that Russia has a veto on the council,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank",
      "Unable to rely on Trump\u2019s \u201cshifting position\u201d on Russia, Giles told NBC News, the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 European nations that say they are prepared to underwrite security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 must become the \u201ccoalition of the able and actually doing something.\u201d",
      "Poland will not hesitate to shoot down objects that violate its airspace and pose a threat, its prime minister said Monday. But, he said, his country would take a more cautious approach when dealing with situations that are less clear-cut, and would need to know it had its allies' support.",
      "\"You really need to think twice before deciding on actions that could trigger a very acute phase of conflict,\u201d Donald Tusk told a news conference.",
      "Hesitation, analysts said, risks sending a dangerous signal.",
      "\u201cEurope and NATO have to show the will to respond forcefully to Russia,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cRussia is trying to gauge whether it\u2019s possible to single out individual elements of the alliance,\u201d he said in a phone interview.",
      "A forceful approach, Brake argued, would involve not just intercepting Russian aircraft, but also sending \u201cmanned fighter jets\u201d that could shoot Russian jets down \u201cat any minute.\u201d",
      "As an example, he pointed to 2015, when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane seconds after it violated the country\u2019s airspace near the Syrian border. Moscow did not retaliate militarily.",
      "\u201cRussia didn\u2019t declare war on Turkey,\u201d Brake said. \u201cWavering is much more dangerous than a forceful approach.\u201d"
