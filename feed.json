      "Swiss singer Nemo, who won the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest, has decided to return the winners' trophy",
      "GENEVA -- Swiss singer Nemo, who won the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest, said Thursday they will return the winner's trophy because Israel is being allowed to compete in the politically troubled pop music competition.",
      "In an Instagram video, Nemo held the microphone-shaped glass ornament and said \u201ctoday I no longer feel like this trophy belongs on my shelf.\u201d",
      "\u201cEurovision says it stands for unity, for inclusion and dignity for all people,\u201d Nemo said, adding that Israel\u2019s participation, given its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza, shows those ideals are at odds with organizers\u2019 decisions.",
      "The nonbinary singer won the contest in May 2024 with pop-operatic ode \u201cThe Code.\u201d",
      "Five countries have announced they will boycott the 2026 contest after organizers declined to expel Israel: Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, Slovenia and Iceland.",
      "\u201cWhen entire countries withdraw it should be clear that something is deeply wrong,\u201d Nemo said before placing the trophy in a box they said would be sent to the Geneva headquarters of the European Broadcasting Union, which runs Eurovision.",
      "Next year\u2019s Eurovision is scheduled to take place in Vienna in May, after Austrian singer JJ won the 2025 contest in Basel, Switzerland. By Eurovision tradition, the winning country hosts the following year.",
      "The walkouts cast a cloud over the future of what\u2019s meant to be a feel-good cultural party marked by friendly rivalry and disco beats.",

      "Archivists are about a quarter of the way through cataloging the 150-plus boxes of material that document the 76-year-old filmmaker\u2019s role in bringing to life iconic characters like Indiana Jones and Yoda, and directing actors ranging from Geena Davis and Glenn Close to Morgan Freeman and Kevin Costner.",
      "\u201cAll I wanted to ever do was be a movie director. And so, all the details meant something to me,\u201d Kasdan said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier to have this mass of stuff available to anybody who is interested.\u201d",
      "The archive includes scripts, call sheets and still photos \u2014 including a few rarities.",
      "Before Costner became an Oscar winner and Hollywood icon, he worked various studio jobs while taking nighttime drama lessons. His break \u2014 or so he thought \u2014 came when Kasdan cast him in 1983\u2019s \u201cThe Big Chill.\u201d",
      "Costner played Alex, whose death brings his fellow Michigan alums together. Unfortunately his big flashback scene ended up on the cutting-room floor.",
      "What are believed to be among the only existing photographs of the famously deleted scene are part of the Kasdan collection, now housed in Ann Arbor.",
      "\u201cDifferent people will be interested in different things,\u201d Kasdan said, pointing to his work writing the \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d screenplay as one possible destination for researchers. The archive features audio cassette recordings of Kasdan discussing the film with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. It also includes Polaroids taken of cast and crew members on the sets of his movies.",
      "There are props, too, including a cowboy hat from the 1985 Western \u201cSilverado,\u201d worn by none other than Costner. Kasdan and the kid from California would work together again on \u201cWyatt Earp\u201d in the \u201990s. Costner also starred in \u201cThe Bodyguard,\u201d which Kasdan wrote.",

      "Kasdan\u2019s papers are part of the University of Michigan Library\u2019s Screen Arts Mavericks and Makers Collection, which includes Orson Welles, Robert Altman, Jonathan Demme, Nancy Savoca and John Sayles. Kasdan, who grew up in West Virginia and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1970 and a master\u2019s two years later, is the lone Michigan alum among the group.",

      "The Mariachi Rams are reshaping NFL game day by blending traditional Mexican music with Los Angeles\u2019 hip-hop and rock influences",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez steadies her violin and scans the crowd from the sixth floor of SoFi Stadium as 70,000 fans stream into a Los Angeles Rams home game. Below her, blue-and-gold jerseys mix with charro suits and sombreros, and the low rumble of pregame noise swells into the opening notes of the late Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s \u201cCrazy Train\u201d reimagined through trumpets, guitarr\u00f3n and vihuela.",
      "On Hern\u00e1ndez's right, rock guitarist Nita Strauss cuts through with an electric solo as the several-piece mariachi ensemble locked into rhythm. On the concourse, fans stop mid-step, phones raised, caught by the unlikely fusion of rock, mariachi and football.",
      "At games, it's not unusual to hear Kendrick Lamar,Bad Bunny and Beyonc\u00e9's music blaring through the speakers. But the Mariachi Rams are reshaping the sound of NFL game day, blending traditional Mexican music with Los Angeles\u2019 hip-hop and rock influences in a way no other team in the league does.",
      "\u201cMariachi music has so much flexibility and I think that\u2019s special because we get to show how versatile mariachi music is to the NFL audience,\u201d says Hern\u00e1ndez, who is the only woman in the NFL\u2019s first official mariachi band. She's the daughter of Mariachi legend Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, who built the ensemble when he partnered with the Rams in 2019.",
      "In one moment, they play classic mariachi standards. In the next, they are turning Tupac Shakur\u2019s \u201cCalifornia Love\u201d into a brass-heavy anthem as a lowrider car bounces nearby while fans roar from the stands.",
      "\u201cThe things that come out of our communities, all of our communities, we all represent each other,\u201d says rapper Xzibit, who performed with the USC Marching Band at halftime during the Rams game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He says seeing the Mariachi Rams on the NFL stage speaks to how the culture moves through the city without boundaries.",
      "\u201cTo be brought into something where culture is embraced on that level,\u201d Xzibit says. \u201cThat's when you feel like you're part of something that matters.\u201d",
      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez didn\u2019t land in the Mariachi Rams by accident.",
      "A Rams staffer approached him several years ago with a video of a mariachi group performing at a major soccer match and asked a simple question: \u201cCould this work for football?\u201d recalled the Grammy-nominated musician and founder of Mariachi Sol de Mexico and Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles, an all-female mariachi ensemble that includes Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez didn't hesitate. He believed it could work with the right musicians and musical range. What followed was the formation of a 10-member ensemble built to bridge tradition and modern Los Angeles sound, performing classic mariachi standards alongside reimagined pop and hip-hop anthems from \u201cEl Rey\u201d to Tupac's \u201cCalifornia Love.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's pride and passion,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez says.",
      "The Mariachi Rams are made up of:",
      "Santiago Espinoza (vihuela), Mateo Real (guitar), Joshua Gutierrez (guitarr\u00f3n), Kevin Ramirez (trumpet), Christopher Rubalcava (trumpet), Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez (violin), Adrian Arias (violin), Ricardo Rios (violin), Ricardo Cisneros (violin) and Joaquin Telles (violin).",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez says his vision from the start was to reflect the city around them musically and culturally.",
      "\u201cWhen they see young musicians on that jumbotron at SoFi playing songs they completely connect with, you can't even imagine the pride they feel,\u201d he says.",
      "While other NFL teams, including the Houston Texans, now feature mariachi bands as part of their cultural programming, the Rams were the first to embed a mariachi ensemble as a recurring game-day element when they launched the Mariachi Rams six years ago. Since then, a handful of teams have followed.",
      "Behind the stadium lights and viral halftime moments are musicians who spend most of their week far from the field teaching students, working in offices, designing graphics or performing in classical orchestras across Southern California.",
      "Several members of the Mariachi Rams teach through Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s mariachi academy. Others balance careers in education, banking, graphic design and orchestral performance before transforming into stadium entertainers on Sundays.",

It's a staple across various neighborhoods through quincea\u00f1eras, weddings, parades, street festivals and championship celebrations. Bringing that sound into SoFi Stadium, Daly says, was about introducing something new to the city in hopes of reflecting what was already there.",
      "\u201cOur main logo is the two letters \u2018Los Angeles.\u2019 It\u2019s LA, right?\u201d Daly says. \u201cYou can\u2019t not celebrate Mexican American culture if you\u2019re an Angeleno. If you don\u2019t understand Mexican American culture, you\u2019re probably not going win over this market.\u201d",
      "For Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez, the meaning of the Mariachi Rams stretches beyond music and game day. It\u2019s about visibility in a space that has rarely made room for women.",
      "\u201cIt makes people feel seen,\u201d she says of the band\u2019s presence at SoFi. \u201cIt makes them feel excited to see that their home team, the Rams, recognizes that and embraces it.\u201d",
      "As the only woman in the group, Hern\u00e1ndez says she stands at the intersection of tradition and change. For her father, the moment is deeply personal, saying she broke the mold for his family's seven generations of male musicians.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez believes the band can break barriers too.",
      "\u201cI think it's the beginning of a movement in the NFL,\" he says. \u201cIf these teams know they have Latino fans supporting them, they're going to think of bringing mariachi too.\u201d",

      "NAPLES, Italy -- At long last, vindication is at hand for an Oscar-winning composer who sought to prove he was just as capable of breathing life into Italy\u2019s grand theaters as gritty Hollywood films.",
      "On Friday night, Naples\u2019 Teatro San Carlo will stage Ennio Morricone\u2019s only opera, \u201cPartenope,\u201d three full decades after its composition. It is inspired by the mythical siren who drowned herself after failing to enchant Ulysses, her body washing ashore and becoming a settlement that grew over millennia into the seaside city of Naples.",
      "When Morricone wrote \u201cPartenope\u201d in 1995, he was already the world-famous creator of the theme to the Spaghetti Western \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d and haunting soundtracks for epic films such as \u201cThe Untouchables\u201d and \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America.\u201d",
      "He earned an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, but his compositions never resounded in the hallowed halls of opera houses \u2014 viewed in his home country as the elite musical echelon. To his great chagrin, Partenope gathered dust for decades; Morricone died without seeing it performed.",
      "\u201cIn the end, he read as a sign of destiny the fact he would not make his debut in the opera world,\u201d Alessandro De Rosa, a close collaborator who coauthored Morricone's autobiography, said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m sure that if he were alive now, he would have taken the challenge and would have dialogued with the orchestra and the director, tirelessly, like a young kid.\u201d",
      "Director Vanessa Beecroft and conductor Riccardo Frizza had to find their way through the visionary work without the benefit of those notes.",
      "\u201cIt would have been wonderful to be able to talk to Morricone about his musical choices \u2026 but we had to understand them from what he left us and tried to interpret them in the best way,\u201d Frizza said.",
      "For instance, he chose not to use violins in this orchestra, instead favoring flutes, harps and horns, which appear in Greek mythology, Frizza explained.",
      "\u201cThen you have the modern instruments, lots of percussion, with the Neapolitan sounds provided by tambourines and putipu\u2019,\u201d he added, referencing a friction drum used in local folk music.",
      "Teatro San Carlo was filled with anticipation on Thursday evening as Neapolitans attended an open rehearsal. Free tickets were snapped up in just a few hours.",
      "\u201cIt was such a long wait, that\u2019s why we are here today,\u201d said middle-aged Alfonso Ieneroso as he entered the theater.",
      "The mythical Partenope is part of Naples\u2019 culture, with tradition suggesting her voice represents the city\u2019s enduring spirit. The original Greek settlement was named for her. She is depicted at monuments like the Fontana della Sirena, a fountain that has become one of the city's symbols. Young children all along the Gulf of Naples, living under Mount Vesuvius\u2019 shadow, learn the legend of Partenope from their parents.",

      "And like Morricone's opera, Naples itself spent decades downtrodden and overlooked, but is enjoying resurgence: The U.N. recognized its pizza makers as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity; It featured on foreign media lists of must-visit destinations; Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels were acclaimed bestsellers that became an HBO series; and its soccer team in 2023 took home the nation\u2019s top league trophy for the first time since Maradona played in the 1980s \u2014 then won again in May.",
      "Naples has also been celebrating its 2,500th anniversary this year, and Morricone\u2019s opera marks the culmination of festivities. The protagonist in his adaptation is a woman who, after her husband dies and she is separated from her best friend, refuses the consolation of being transformed into a distant constellation. Instead, she asks the gods to let her stretch her wings along the gulf on which an immortal city will arise.",
      "The production explores the link between the ancient legend and the modern city\u2019s identity, as two sopranos embody Partenope simultaneously, reflecting her dual nature as body and myth.",
      "Morricone originally composed the one-act opera \u2014 free of charge \u2014 to accompany a libretto by authors Guido Barbieri and Sandro Cappelletto for a small festival in Positano, just south of Naples on the Amalfi coast. But it was not to be: the festival went bankrupt and Partenope was shelved.",
      "There were several attempts to revive their work, including one between 1998 and 2000 with the Teatro Massimo of Palermo. But that project ultimately ran aground when a director couldn\u2019t be secured.",
      "\u201cIn those years Morricone had the torment of not being accepted as a composer of what he called \u2018absolute music,\u2019 as he was identified with his popular movie scores,\u201d Barbieri, one of the libretto\u2019s authors, said in an interview. Cappelletto said that, in a conversation with the two authors in 2017, three years before his death, Morricone appeared \u201cat peace\u201d with his music career.",
      "Partenope has inspired several productions over the centuries, including operas by renowned composers George Frideric Handel and Antonio Vivaldi in the 18th century, and a 2024 movie by Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino. Morricone\u2019s work is finally coming alive to join their ranks.",
      "\u201cIt was a great pleasure to listen to Morricone\u2019s music, the real protagonist of this opera,\u201d said Giovanni Capuano, a 26-year-old cinema student, after Thursday's rehearsal. \u201cHis spirit is back and has enchanted us.\u201d",

      "And finally, nearly two hours into a perplexing muddle of a storyline, we have some clarity of thought. No, dear, we want to tell Ella, played by the lovely Emma Mackey, who is truly the only reason to watch any of this. No, your brain is fine (and by the way, what a depressing line to put in the mouth of your most intelligent character \u2014 a hard-working woman in politics). It\u2019s your script you can\u2019t trust, Ella! Run away from it. Now.",
      "It\u2019s hard to understand how \u201cElla McCay,\u201d the first original feature from writer-director Brooks in 15 years, goes so utterly haywire. Is this really the same mind that wrote the memorable \u201cBroadcast News\"? \u201cTerms of Endearment\"? \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d? We get a bit of a hint in the studio's press notes, which mention that Brooks began his script \u201cwithout a specific storyline in mind.\u201d",
      "Hmm. Perhaps that (unintentionally) explains this tangle of half-baked characters and subplots \u2014 each more head-scratching than the next, but also boring \u2014 and an ending that's unbelievable, by which we mean not believable. What\u2019s even less believable is that smart supporting actors like Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri, Woody Harrelson and Rebecca Hall didn\u2019t walk out in protest of a lack of coherence. (Well, actually, Hall is gone in a matter of minutes.)",
      "The main action takes place over three days in 2008, in an unnamed state. An aggressively folksy Julie Kavner as narrator tells us Ella is a great person, and super-bright, and at 34, one of the youngest people to serve as lieutenant governor.",
      "She\u2019s also a moral compass \u2014 both in the dog-eat-dog world of politics, where she just wants to pass good laws that help good people \u2014 and in her messed-up family. This family includes her weaselly father (Harrelson, intermittently amusing) who, in a flashback to when Ella was 16, loses his job in a sexual harassment scandal.",
      "Soon after, when Ella\u2019s mother (Hall, wasted) tells her that Dad is moving the family to California, Ella insists on staying put, at her school. She'll live with her loyal and loving Aunt Helen (Curtis), who runs \u2014 of course! \u2014 the diner next door.",
      "Flash forward 18 years, and Ella is summoned by her governor boss (Albert Brooks). He tells her he\u2019s in line for a Cabinet position, which means Ella would be interim governor. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get this any other way,\u201d he notes, helpfully,",
      "There\u2019s one prickly problem. Ella is enmeshed in scandal; she's been having amorous relations, with her own husband, at lunchtime, in a room that's technically state property. (Yep, this is the best scandal they could come up with.)",
      "Also, there\u2019s a reporter who knows this, and he's trying to extort her in exchange for better access (to what, is unclear). Her husband is the one handling it. And so we flash back to high school to meet Ryan, who seems nice enough (but truly ridiculous as a high school student \u2014 there clearly was no de-aging budget).",
      "Anyway, Ryan (Jack Lowden) is now poised to become the state\u2019s first gentleman. We can see how Ella likes his easy good looks. But then, poof, he suddenly becomes a total jerk and we can\u2019t believe Ella would even think to be married to such a cad. But there\u2019s a lot here that we wouldn\u2019t think would happen.",

      "Malo died Monday night, his wife, Betty Malo, posted on his Facebook page. He had been battling cancer. The frontman of The Mavericks had documented his health journey on social media since he disclosed in June 2024 that he was receiving treatment for colon cancer.",
      "In September 2025, Malo said on Instagram that he was battling LMD, or leptomeningeal disease, a rare complication when cancer spreads to membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.",
      "The diagnosis forced The Mavericks to cancel dates with Dwight Yoakam in the middle of a joint tour. Malo left home in Nashville, Tennessee, to seek treatment in Houston, keeping his fans updated along his health journey.",

      "Some call the band alt-country. Others describe it as Americana, roots, Latin, Tejano or swing. It\u2019s all of the above and more, driven by songs written by Malo, his expansive guitar style and his broad vocal range, from a soaring, velvety baritone to operatic high notes.",

      "The Japanese writer-director Mamoru Hosoda has made some amazing films that take profound leaps into dreamlike worlds.",
      "Hosoda\u2019s \u201cMirai\u201d (2018) is about a 4-year-old boy who\u2019s resentful of his newborn sister. But in his backyard garden, he meets his sister as a teenager. This is just the first of many domestic time travels, as the boy meets other relatives from other points in their lives. A new understanding begins to dawn.",
      "In \u201cBelle\u201d (2022), a teenager who\u2019s lived through tragedy finds a soaring catharsis in a virtual realm. I thought it was one of the best films of that year, and I still think it might be the best movie ever made about the internet. Either way, its song-and-soul-shattering climax is unforgettable.",
      "Yet in Hosoda\u2019s latest, \u201cScarlet,\u201d the director\u2019s enviable reach exceeds his grasp. In it, his female protagonist is a medieval princess who, after seeing her king father killed by her uncle, and dying herself, awakes in an expansive purgatory. In this strange afterlife, peopled by the dead from all time periods, she seeks revenge for her father.",
      "Anyone, I think, would grant that a Japanese anime that transplants \u201cHamlet\u201d to a surreal netherworld is a touch more ambitious than your average animated movie. Unlike the wide majority of cartoons, or even live-action movies, the problem with \u201cScarlet\u201d isn\u2019t a lack of imagination. It\u2019s too much.",
      "Hosoda, a former Studio Ghibli animator whose other films include \u201cWolf Children\u201d and \u201cSummer Wars,\u201d has an extraordinary knack for crafting anime worlds of visual complexity while pursuing existential ideas with a childlike sincerity. But an excess of baroque design, of emotion, of scope, sinks Hosoda\u2019s \u201cScarlet.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of misfire you can forgive. If you\u2019re going to fail by overreach, it might as well be with a wildly ambitious rendering of \u201cHamlet.\u201d",

A stairway to heaven is rumored to exist somewhere. As she seeks Claudius, Scarlet is joined by a stranger she encounters named Hijiri (Okada Masaki).

Hosoda tries to build some interiority to the story (not a small aspect of \u201cHamlet\u201d) through Hijiri's backstory, telescoping Shakespeare\u2019s quandaries to contemporary times.",

Still, it\u2019s often dazzling to look at it and it's never not impassioned. Hosoda remains a director capable of reaching trembling, operatic heights. In \u201cScarlet,\u201d for instance, Claudius gets a spectacular death scene, a remarkable accomplishment considering he's already dead.",

      "Seemingly immune to widely negative reviews, \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d notched the biggest opening ever for the weekend after Thanksgiving, which usually is a more muted buffet of leftovers. It\u2019s also the biggest opening of the year for a PG-13 rated movie and the second biggest horror opening, behind \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites.\u201d The movies and the game are about a family restaurant, Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza, whose anthropomorphic robots turn murderous at night.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of doom and gloom about the industry overall, but this movie helped drive the industry to the biggest first weekend post-Thanksgiving ever,\" said Jim Orr, who heads domestic distribution for Universal.",
      "The first film, also a Blumhouse production, was a surprise hit two years ago. It opened to $80 million in October 2023, despite also being available to stream on Peacock. Universal decided to open the sequel exclusively in theaters. With a reported production price tag of only $36 million, \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d is on its way to being another smash. It\u2019s another reminder of the potential massive upside of theatrical releases as many in the industry and out wonder what Netflix\u2019s acquisition of Warner Bros. will mean for moviegoing.",
      "The sequel, written by the game\u2019s creator Scott Cawthon, saw the return of cast members like Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard and Elizabeth Lail as well as director Emma Tammi. Reviews were dismal, even worse than the first. Mark Kennedy, in his zero star review for The Associated Press, called it an \u201cincoherent mess.\u201d But horror fans have been known to turn out for opening weekends regardless of reviews. This audience had a decidedly more positive take. According to PostTrak polling data, 70% of ticket buyers said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d recommend \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to their friends.",

      "It was also enough to push the more family-friendly \u201cZootopia 2\u201d into second place in its second weekend in theaters, where it added $43 million in North America. But the Disney film isn\u2019t hurting after its record Thanksgiving opening. With $219 million from 52 territories internationally, including China, the running global total is an eye-popping $915.8 million. It's officially pushed Walt Disney Studio releases over the $5 billion mark globally \u2014 the only studio to do so this year.",
      "\u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d also a Universal release, landed in third place in its third weekend with $16.8 million from 3,985 theaters, brining its domestic total just shy of $297 million.",
      "Fourth place went to Gkids\u2019 anime \u201cJujutsu Kaisen: Execution\u201d which opened to an estimated $10.2 million, while Lionsgate's \u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don't\u201d rounded out the top five with $3.5 million, pushing its running global total to $210 million.",
      "\u201cKill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair\u201d was close behind with $3.3 million from 1,198 theaters.

      "The Golden Globes have introduced a best podcast category that's likely to spark conversations",
      "NEW YORK -- The Golden Globes this year introduced a best podcast category and, predictably, the nominees announced Monday will get people talking.",
      "The six nominees for the inaugural best podcast award are \u201cArmchair Expert with Dax Shepard,\u201d \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d \u201cGood Hang with Amy Poehler,\u201d \u201cThe Mel Robbins Podcast,\u201d \u201cSmartLess\u201d and \u201cUp First,\u201d from NPR. Representing a mix of news, advice and celebrity interviews, they were drawn from a shortlist of 25 programs the Globes had previously deemed eligible.",
      "The nominations avoided politics or controversy by passing on popular podcasts from the shortlist, such as conservative-leaning programs \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show,\u201d \u201cThe Tucker Carlson Show,\u201d \u201cThe Ben Shapiro Show,\u201d Candace Owen\u2019s \u201cCandace\u201d and, most notably, \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d which topped Spotify, Apple and YouTube's list of weekly podcast charts this year. The left-leaning \u201cPod Save America\u201d also was snubbed, as were popular true crime podcasts like \u201cMorbid\u201d and \u201cRotten Mango.\u201d",
      "Ben Bogardus, a professor and chair of the journalism department at Quinnipiac University, said it seemed that the Globes' voting body \u2014 after years of scandal for the beleaguered awards show \u2014 wanted to avoid any controversy, like inviting a podcast host who might show up and say something contentious.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to bill themselves as an award show that is for the masses and non-controversial, celebrating the best in entertainment. Having this political sideshow, I think they just wanted to avoid that,\u201d he said.",
      "Reaction to the apparent snubbing of politics-related podcasts early Monday was light, with a handful of X users weighing in with criticism that high-ranking programs from personalities like Rogan and \u201cmanosphere\u201d podcaster Theo Von had been left off the final cut. There was no direct reaction from the hosts themselves.",
      "Shapiro had launched an all-out Golden Globes publicity campaign for his decade-old podcast, on which he\u2019s spoken with the likes of U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the past year. In addition to making the rounds with industry publications, Shapiro also secured massive billboard space in New York City\u2019s Times Square.",
      "The 25 potential candidates \u2014 including The New York Times' \u201cThe Daily\u201d and Barstool Sports' \u201cPardon My Take\u201d \u2014 mostly matched up with the most listened-to shows.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s how you want to pick your \u2018best podcast,\u2019 that\u2019s certainly one starting point and one way to do it,\u201d says Karl Hughes, a 20-year podcasting veteran who is CEO of The Podcast Consultant. \u201cI think it leaves a lot of stuff out. It leaves a lot of nuance out.\u201d",
      "Eligible podcasts must have original content and must have released at least six episodes between Jan. 1, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025, with each episode having a minimum length of 30 minutes. The award, which will be handed out at the Nikki Glaser-hosted show Jan. 11, recognizes \u201cthe quality, creativity, audience engagement and impact\u201d of the podcast, per the Globes.",
      "Many podcast experts were left scratching their heads since the Globes didn't use any categories for its long list and was a bit murky about what constituted a best podcast. Quality of production? Consistency? The stories being told? Raw numbers?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for the industry to get more recognition and getting recognition in a major award ceremony is awesome,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI think that\u2019s cool to see. But the way it\u2019s done, of course, is a very blunt instrument.\u201d",

      "While more digital-friendly awards shows like the Webby Awards, the Ambies, iHeartRadio and The Shorty Awards recognize podcasting, the Globes' move marks the first time podcasts have been included by a major awards show.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019ll open up the door for more individuals and businesses that want to use the medium to tell interesting stories because it\u2019s got a little more respect, a little more gravitas, a little more mainstream appeal,\u201d he said.",

      "Bogardus marveled at how the podcasting industry has grown up in the past 25 years, moving beyond its origins in radio and giving hosts freedom that content creators in other media don't have: \u201cGoing into an award show now really shows that it has come into its own as a type of communication that people consume, which can be on par with television, with radio, with streaming, with internet videos, with social media.\u201d",

      "STOCKHOLM -- Hungarian L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai, who won the Nobel Prize in literature for his surreal and anarchic novels that combine a bleak world view with mordant humor, gave a lecture in Stockholm on Sunday in one of his rare public appearances.",
      "The lecture was part of the Nobel week that is underway in Stockholm and Oslo with laureates holding news conferences and giving speeches before they are awarded the prestigious prizes.",
      "Krasznahorkai's lecture, which he gave in Hungarian, ranged across topics such as old and new angels, human dignity, hope or the lack thereof, rebellion and his observations of a clochard \u2014 or tramp \u2014 on the Berlin subway.",
      "He introduced his lecture, according to the English translation, by saying that \u201con receiving the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature, I originally wished to share my thought with you on the subject of hope, but as my stores of hope have definitely come to an end, I will now speak about angels.\u201d",
      "As opposed to \u201cthe angels of old,\u201d the new angels, Krasznahorkai said, \u201chave no wings, but they also have no message, none whatsoever. They are merely here among us in their simple street clothes, unrecognizable if they so wish.",
      "\u201cThey just stand there and look at us, they are searching for our gaze, and in this search there is a plea for us, to look into their eyes, so that we ourselves can transmit a message to them, only that unfortunately, we have no message to give,\u201d the author writes in sad, yet poetic prose.",
      "Expressing himself in his long, winding trademark sentences full of apocalypse but without full stops, he says it comes as a shock when he \u201cdetects the horrific story of these new angels that stand before me, the story that they are sacrifices, sacrifices: and not for us, but because of us, for every single one of us, because of every single one of us, angels without wings and angels without a message, and all the while knowing that there is war, war and only war, war in nature, war in society, and this war is being waged not only with weapons, not only with torture, not only with destruction: of course, this is one end of the scale, but this war proceeds at the opposite of the scale as well, because one single bad word is enough.\u201d",
      "When the Nobel judges announced the award for Krasznahorkai in October, they described the 71-year-old as \u201ca great epic writer\u201d whose work \u201cis characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess.\u201d",
      "\u201cKrasznahorkai\u2019s work can be seen as part of a Central European tradition,\" the Nobel Prize organization said. \u201dImportant features are pessimism and apocalypse, but also humor and unpredictability.\"",

      "Between Friday and Tuesday, South Carolina health officials confirmed 27 new measles cases in an outbreak in and around northwestern Spartanburg County. In two months, 111 people have been sickened by the vaccine-preventable virus.",
      "More than 250 people, including students from nine area elementary, middle and high schools, are in quarantine \u2014 some for the second time since the outbreak began in October. Most of the state's new cases stemmed from exposures at Way of Truth Church in Inman. Church leaders have been \u201cvery helpful,\u201d said state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell.",
      "\u201cWe are faced with ongoing transmission that we anticipate will go on for many more weeks, at least in our state,\u201d said Bell.",
      "In Arizona and Utah, an outbreak has ballooned since August. Mohave County, Arizona has logged 172 cases and the Southwest Utah Public Health Department has logged 82 cases. The border cities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, are the heaviest hit.",
      "Overall, Utah has confirmed 115 measles cases this year. Arizona has confirmed 176.",
      "Nationally, the measles case count is nearing 2,000 for a disease that has been considered eliminated in the U.S. since 2000, a result of routine childhood vaccinations.",

    "story": [
      "An infant botulism outbreak has sickened at least 39 babies across the U.S. and underscored the crucial role of a medication that treats the rare disease",
      "When Alessandro Barbera was rushed to a California hospital with infant botulism in October, his father had barely heard of the disease, never mind the rare and costly treatment that likely saved the newborn\u2019s life.",
      "Now, however, Tony Barbera is deeply grateful for BabyBIG, the sole antidote to the paralyzing and potentially deadly illnesses linked to contaminated ByHeart infant formula.",
      "\u201cIt is hugely remarkable,\u201d said Barbera, 35, whose son is slowly recovering.",
      "The botulism outbreak tied to ByHeart formula has sickened at least 39 babies across in 18 states since August \u2014 and showed the value of the treatment made from blood plasma donated by a small group of scientists and other volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is almost like a miracle,\u201d said Dr. Vijay Viswanath, a pediatric neurologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, who has treated several children with botulism during his career \u2014 including one in the current outbreak.",
      "\u201cPrior to the discovery of BabyBIG, some of these hospitalizations would take two or three months,\u201d Viswanath said, if infected children recovered at all.",
      "Licensed in 2003, BabyBIG is the brand name for human botulism immune globulin, an IV medication that uses antibodies from volunteers vaccinated against botulism to help babies too young to fight the disease on their own.",
      "The treatment was the brainchild of the late Dr. Stephen Arnon, who was a scientist with the California Department of Public Health. In 1976, Arnon and colleagues identified the rare form of botulism that affects infants younger than 1 \u2014 and then spent his 45-year career figuring out how to treat it. The disease occurs when babies ingest botulism spores that germinate in the intestine and produce a dangerous toxin that attacks the nervous system.",
      "More than 3,700 children worldwide have been treated with BabyBIG since Arnon and his team conducted a pivotal clinical trial in California in 1997 that showed the medication could shorten hospital stays and reduce the need for breathing machines.",
      "Produced in small batches every five years, BabyBIG costs nearly $70,000 per treatment, according to the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which Arnon founded. Under state law, fees from the sale of the drug are used only to fund the botulism program.",
      "The medication relies on donors like Nancy Shine, a 76-year-old retired biochemist in California who was vaccinated against botulism because she worked with the lethal germ in a lab. Arnon first recruited Shine and other scientists for the BabyBIG project two decades ago because their blood produced high levels of antibodies, the blood proteins that neutralize the botulism toxin.",
      "The early protocol required the volunteers to receive boosters doses of an investigational botulism vaccine also used by the U.S. military and then undergo a procedure that harvests the blood plasma that contains antibodies against botulism types A and B.",

      "\u201cIt was not very pleasant to be vaccinated with,\u201d Shine recalled. \u201cThere were a lot of side effects, like big welts where you got vaccinated and a little bit of pain.\u201d",
      "Still, Shine contributed to three batches of the antitoxin produced between 2008 and 2019.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably the highlight of my career that I actually was able to participate in this project and donate plasma,\u201d Shine said. \u201cWe made a product that could save infants\u2019 lives.\u201d",
      "Because infant botulism is rare, with fewer than 200 cases reported in the U.S. each year, finding funding and other resources to develop the BabyBIG treatment took nearly 15 years and $10.6 million \u2014 and faced substantial hurdles, Arnon noted in a 2007 article.",
      "Today, about 30 people on average provide plasma for each batch of BabyBIG, California health officials said. Batch 8, the latest edition, is being manufactured now at a Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. plant near Los Angeles, according to Giles Platford, president of the company's plasma-derived therapies unit. The company contracts with California officials to produce BabyBIG on a \u201cnot-for-profit basis,\u201d Platford said.",
      "Some of the earliest donors, like Shine, have aged out of the BabyBIG program, which collects blood from adult volunteers up to age 70. New donors are accepted, but they must enroll in a clinical study directed by the California health department and agree to receive a booster dose of a different investigational botulism vaccine.",
      "California officials estimate they have enough BabyBIG in reserve to last until next summer, based on current projections. The ByHeart outbreak is part of a worrisome rise of at least 107 infant botulism cases treated in the U.S. since August, said Dr. Jessica Khouri, senior medical officer for the state program.",
      "Shine recently received a booklet filled with photos and letters from families whose children have recovered from botulism after receiving BabyBIG.",
      "\u201cIt's really wonderful. I read a couple each day,\" she said. \u201cEvery single one of them makes you want to cry.\u201d",

The most recent illness was reported on Dec. 1.",
      "No deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which was announced Nov. 8.",
      "Previously, health officials had said the outbreak included 39 suspected or confirmed cases of infant botulism reported in 18 states since August. That's when officials at California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program reported a rise in treatment of infants who had consumed ByHeart formula. With the expanded definition, the CDC identified 10 additional cases that occurred from December 2023 through July 2025.",
      "ByHeart, a New York-based manufacturer of organic infant formula founded in 2016, recalled all its products sold in the U.S. on Nov. 11. The company, which accounts for about 1% of the U.S. infant formula market, had been selling about 200,000 cans of the product each month.",
      "News that ByHeart products could have been contaminated for years was distressing to Andi Galindo, whose 5-week-old daughter, Rowan, was hospitalized in December 2023 with infant botulism after drinking the formula. Galindo, 36, of Redondo Beach, California, said she insisted on using ByHeart formula to supplement a low supply of breast milk because it was recommended by a lactation consultant as \u201cvery natural, very gentle, very good for the babies.\"",
      "\u201cThat's a hard one,\u201d Galindo said. \u201cIf there is proof that there were issues with their manufacturing and their plant all the way back from the beginning, that is a problem and they really need to be held accountable.\"",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking ByHeart. Being included in the investigation of the outbreak \u201cfeels like a win for all of us,\u201d she said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known in my gut from the beginning that ByHeart was the reason Hank got sick, and to see that these cases are now part of the investigation brings me to tears \u2014 a mix of relief, gratitude and hope that the truth is finally being recognized,\u201d she said.",
      "ByHeart officials did not immediately respond to questions about the expanded outbreak.",
      "The FDA sent inspectors last month to ByHeart plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon, where the formula is produced and packaged. The agency has released no results from those inspections.",
      "The company previously reported that tests by an independent laboratory showed that 36 samples from three different lots contained the type of bacteria that can cause infant botulism.",
      "\u201cWe cannot rule out the risk that all ByHeart formula across all product lots may have been contaminated,\u201d the company wrote on its website last month.",
      "Those results and discussions with the FDA led CDC officials to expand the outbreak, according to Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the investigation.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the contamination appeared to persist across all production runs, different lots, different raw material lots,\u201d Cope said. \u201cThey couldn't isolate it to specific lots from a certain time period.\u201d",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid rate cuts he initiated two months ago",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid reimbursement rate reductions he initiated two months ago, a decision that protects short-term access to care for vulnerable patients while a political fight with Republican legislators to enact additional funding is resolved.",
      "Stein and state Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Dev Sangvai announced Wednesday the state agency would restore reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals and other medical providers of Medicaid services that otherwise generally had been cut by 3% to 10% starting Oct. 1.",
      "The governor had said the reductions were needed to deal with a funding shortfall for Medicaid, which serves more than 3 million people in the ninth-largest state. But legal challenges to the reductions that have resulted recently in judicial rulings demanding some rates return to pre-October levels make maintaining the reductions untenable.",
      "\u201cWhat has not changed is the program doesn\u2019t have enough money. What has changed is that the courts have made very clear that the rates have to go back,\u201d Stein told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "The first-year governor had said the reductions, while painful for Medicaid patients and providers, were unavoidable because a stopgap spending measure the legislature approved in the summer fell $319 million short of what was needed to address population changes and rising health care costs.",
      "\u201cThe legislature forced these cuts onto the program,\u201d Stein said. \u201cIt was absolutely nothing that the department or I wanted to have happen.\u201d",
      "Republican legislators said Stein's actions were unnecessary, unprecedented early in the fiscal year and politically motivated. Still, state House and Senate GOP leaders tried but could not work out this fall legislation to provide extra money that would sustain the program longer.",
      "Stein attempted in recent weeks to pressure lawmakers to act \u2014 even by formally calling a special legislative session last month. But House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger refused to convene, saying Stein had failed to meet the qualifications for such an extraordinary session.",
      "The governor was pushed to relent as Medicaid consumers such as children with autism and providers like adult care homes have successfully sued the health department so far and blocked certain rate reductions.",
      "The plaintiffs accused the state of violating laws by reducing rates unilaterally and discriminating against those with disabilities. A host of groups representing thousands of doctors and other service providers filed their own challenges last week to block the rates more broadly.",
      "As part of the reversal, Sangvai said, the providers will receive retroactively reimbursements for the difference between the reduced and full rates for claims that were filed after the reductions took effect.",

      "The Medicaid shortfall continues, however, an offshoot of GOP leaders being unable to pass a conventional two-year budget \u2014 largely over differences about additional income tax reductions and teacher pay. North Carolina remains the only state without an enacted budget, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A budget was supposed to be in place July 1.",
      "House and Senate Republicans separately agreed in September they would provide an additional $190 million to the Medicaid program. But senators also wanted legislation to allocate previously received federal money to help build a standalone children\u2019s hospital in Wake County by two university medical schools and for rural health investments. Despite previously spending toward these projects, House Republicans are now having second thoughts about completing these investments.",
      "The legislature had already planned to convene next week, but any action or recorded votes is unlikely. Stein said restoring the rates only adds to the urgency for legislators to act and locate more funds.",
      "\u201cIf the legislature would simply do its job and pass a budget that fully funded Medicaid, we never would have had to start this entire enterprise,\u201d Stein said.",
      "Sangvai acknowledged the program would not run out of money until the spring. But he said restoring the rates means his agency is left only with scaling back or eliminating programs and services to find significant savings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a situation we hate to consider because the consequences could in fact be catastrophic,\u201d Sangvai said.",

And whether it is eaten raw or cooked does not matter.",

      "Onesmas Ainebyona stalks the chimps with such spirtual determination that he's been able to win the trust of a chimp leader named Jean, who came down a tree one recent morning as Ainebyona lingered nearby.",
      "It took Ainebyona four years to achieve rapport with Jean, an alpha male that's become so used to people that he pretends to sleep while tourists make a racket that compels other chimps to leave.",
      "Wildlife authorities describe the process of making chimps appear comfortable around humans as \u201chabituation,\u201d a term that fails to account for the struggle between man and beast as they try to understand \u2014 and tolerate \u2014 each other.",
      "Ainebyona and others involved in chimp conservation in this remote Ugandan rainforest say they aim for the kind of communion that at first irks chimps. Habituating chimps can take several years. The conservation efforts employing men like Ainebyona not only trace the apes' movements, but also help ensure chimps like Jean don't die young.",
      "\u201cThe job requires patience,\u201d Ainebyona said. \u201cPassion also. You have to care.\"",
      "Ainebyona doesn't leave the forest even when it rains. \u201cYou accept,\" he said. \"The rain must beat you, but you can\u2019t desert the chimp.\u201d",
      "The rainforest in western Uganda is part of Kibale National Park, a protected area described by some as the world's primate capital. Species range from colobus monkeys to chimpanzees, a major tourist attraction.",
      "But tourists can't be taken to track wild chimpanzees, which flee deeper into dense patches of montane forest and are known to be violent during clashes over territory. Instead, rangers lead tourists to one of three groups of habituated chimps, with numbers ranging from dozens to more than 100 in a group. Chimps in Kibale now number at least 1,000, many of them wild.",
      "Even habituated chimps remain relatively wary of people, and only a few \u2014 like Jean of the Kisongi group, which includes about 80 apes \u2014 appear to have fully overcome any discomfort around people.",
      "\u201cJean is my friend,\u201d Ainebyona declared one recent morning as some tourists gathered nearby. The strong and flamboyant chimp in his 20s lay on his back and put his feet up.",
      "The connection between Ainebyona and Jean was sealed in July when the chimp showed up one day with a wire snare pressing his hand, an injury that risked severing a finger. Ainebyona was among those who removed the wire, which Jean picked up when he strayed outside the forest to steal sugarcane.",
      "Ainebyona is among four men working in shifts as chimp habituators with Jean's group. When the chimps rest, the men crouch in mud nearby. When the primates go hiking, they trek alongside them, sometimes even grunting like them.",
      "Ainebyona carries binoculars and takes note of what he sees. The goal is to increase the chimp numbers and extract more tourism revenue. At Kibale, a permit to track chimps costs a foreign visitor $250.",
      "Tourist guide Alex Turyatunga told The Associated Press that the habituation process is enlightening. He and his colleagues have been trying to fully habituate the Kisongi group for more than a decade, he said.",

      "Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist who died in October, built strong bonds with the chimps she studied in Tanzania\u2019s Gombe National Park. Her work helped shape a sympathetic view of the chimp as an emotionally complex creature. The species is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered, facing threats such as poaching and habitat loss.",
      "Kibale National Park received enhanced protected status in 1993 after the forest had been encroached upon by hundreds of people who built homes there and felled trees for firewood. The park is now thriving, thanks in part to the habituation efforts that make it possible for tourists to contribute directly to chimp conservation.",
      "Chimp habituation can open up research opportunities that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible, and Kibale is home to one of the longest-running field stations in the tropics, said David Morgan, who co-directs the Goualougo Triangle Ape Project in the Republic of Congo.",
      "\u201cIf chimps don\u2019t want to be seen, they\u2019re incredibly good at disappearing,\u201d said Morgan, who also is a chimpanzee and gorilla expert at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.",
      "Chimp habituation and related tourism can improve how the public interacts with the apes, he said.",
      "\u201cThe communities that are habituated, they serve as kind of an emblem of the importance of what we can learn from them and what we stand to gain by protecting them and what we stand to lose by not,\u201d Morgan said.",
      "Turyatunga takes a walkie-talkie when he ventures into the forest, now and then asking habituators if they have close and clear views of chimps. That\u2019s because chimps, even when habituated, are more likely to be seen up in the trees.",
      "\u201cYou listen for early morning calls when they are getting out of the nests. Then present yourself to the chimps \u2014 they see you are there, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep with them. If they move, follow them.\"",

      "Chile is heading into a high-stakes presidential runoff defined by sharply contrasting visions of the country\u2019s recent past and visions for its future",
      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Ask many Chileans how their country fared in the past several years and they'll describe a descent into disaster: Venezuelan gangs surged across porous borders, bringing unprecedented kidnappings and contract killings to one of the region\u2019s safest nations. A social uprising unleashed violent chaos on once-sleepy streets. An economy long vaunted for its rapid growth sputtered into a stall.",
      "These are the voters who hope to elect their country's most right-wing president since its military dictatorship on Sunday.",
      "Former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, 59, they argue, can bring back the simple, stable life that Chileans lost to rising crime, uncontrolled migration and left-wing excesses. Kast's rival in this runoff presidential election is their worst fear: a communist.",
      "\u201cWe need to go back in time to when Chile meant peace and quiet, when there weren't so many Venezuelans and Colombians in the streets, when you didn't have to look over your shoulder every second,\u201d said Ernesto Romero, 70, shucking corn at his vegetable stall in Chile\u2019s capital of Santiago.",
      "Ask the same question to other Chileans and they'll recount an opposite reality: A shorter workweek, higher minimum wage and more generous pension system made one of Latin America's most unequal countries more livable, they say. The homicide rate declined in the last two years, official figures show. A defiant foreign policy \u2014 outspoken against Venezuela\u2019s autocratic President Nicolas Maduro, U.S. President Donald Trump's denial of climate change and Israeli actions against Palestinians \u2014 made Chile a regional champion of democracy.",
      "These are the voters who hope, against heavy odds, to elect their country's most left-wing president since its return to democracy in 1990.",
      "Jeannette Jara, 51, they argue, can save Chile from the wave of far-right populism that has upended politics across the world. Jara's rival is their worst fear: The son of a Nazi party member with a fondness for Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s brutal dictatorship.",
      "\u201cWe need to go forward,\" said Luc\u00eda Poblete, a 32-year-old engineer at Jara\u2019s rally late Wednesday. \u201cKast will erase all the progress we\u2019ve made for women, for labor rights, for civil freedoms.\u201d",
      "The chasm between Chilean perspectives on the status quo underscores not only the depth of Chile's divisions but also the stakes of Sunday's showdown, which Kast is expected to win after 70% of voters backed right-leaning parties in the first round.",
      "Today, Kast is hoping the third time\u2019s the charm, and his presidential run has so far been a much more effective endeavor than the previous two. That's largely thanks to fears of organized crime and immigration driving voters to the right.",
      "\u201cJara seems more grounded, more sensible. But it's not the time for that. It's time for drastic measures, for shows of force,\u201d said Eduardo Marillana, 48, a former Jara supporter who jumped ship for Kast after his truck was stolen a few weeks ago. \u201cWhether we like it or not, we need the far right now.\u201d",
      "In 2021, the Catholic father of nine lost the runoff election to current President Gabriel Boric, a former firebrand student protest leader who rattled investors with his promises to \u201cbury neoliberalism\u201d but appealed to millions of ordinary Chileans sick of fiscal austerity, angry about social inequality and eager to reexamine Chile\u2019s traumatic past.",
      "Kast's family ties to the Nazi party sparked an uproar at the time \u2014 as did his apparent nostalgia for Gen. Pinochet (who he said \u201cwould vote for me if he were alive\u201d) and his fierce opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion without exception.",
      "This time, Kast has dodged questions about his social views, pivoting to the more politically palatable issues of insecurity and mass migration that have ginned up voter anxiety and boosted the right from Washington to Paris.",

      "\u201cThe right exaggerates insecurity to convince people that the only possible response is extreme force,\u201d Solari said. \u201cBut we've seen elsewhere in Latin America that when that happens, ultimately what gets imprisoned is democracy itself.\u201d",

      "When gunmen stormed St. Mary Catholic School in Nigeria's Papiri community, the children tried to escape but were told they would be shot if they ran away",
      "PAPIRI, Nigeria -- The children at St. Mary Catholic School in Nigeria's Papiri community were jolted from their sleep with a loud crash at the school gate. Half asleep and confused, they dashed out of their dorms, some landing in the hands of gunmen.",
      "Onyeka Chieme, an elementary school student, waited with bated breath as the loud thuds got nearer. Upon seeing men armed with guns, he recalled jumping through the window with some friends. The gunmen gave chase on motorbikes, shooting into the air and startling him and the others to a halt.",
      "\u201cThey said if we ran, they would shoot us,\u201d Chieme told The Associated Press during a visit to his family in Papiri in the north-central Niger State. They watched in horror as the gunmen set fire to a statue of Mary and a Nigerian flag before carting the children away on motorbikes and in buses.",
      "Chieme is one of the 303 schoolchildren \u2014 many of them between 10 and 17 years old \u2014 and 12 teachers abducted from the school on Nov. 21 in one of the country's biggest mass school abductions. The attack came days after 25 students were abducted in similar circumstances in the neighboring Kebbi state.",
      "Fifty of the Niger State students escaped in the hours that followed the attack and more than two weeks after, Chieme was freed on Sunday together with 99 others. However, 153 are still held with the teachers, among them Chieme's brother.",
      "The Nigerian government did not say how they were released or whether any suspect had been arrested. Arrests are rare and ransom payments common in such cases, and authorities have provided vague information about rescue efforts.",
      "\u201cOn the first night we got there, I thought they were going to kill us,\u201d Chieme said from his home as his parents watched. \u201cBut their leader said we should not fear, it is just money that they wanted. If they paid the money, they would release everyone to go home.\u201d",
      "Chieme described harrowing experiences during the more than two weeks in the bush, where the abducted students and staff were forced to sleep in the open. They were separated, he said, with the older ones blindfolded and their hands tied.",
      "Every day, they woke up on the stubby grass with food and water from a nearby river. Those who did not keep quiet were often beaten, and guns were never out of sight, he said.",
      "Occasionally, aircraft would fly above them, and the gunmen would instruct them to hide beneath trees to avoid being discovered.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want the airplanes to see us,\u201d Chieme said, referring to Nigerian military jets that officials said were searching forests for the children. Analysts say the gangs use captives as shields to avoid being bombarded.",
      "Nigeria fights multiple armed groups operating across the country. They include deadly religious sects, including Boko Haram and its splinter group, Islamic State West Africa Province, as well as amorphous groups popularly called bandits who ride en masse on motorbikes to attack communities and kidnap people for ransom.",
      "After attacks, communities and families pay ransoms to the bandits, sometimes millions of naira (thousands of dollars). No group has claimed responsibility for the Papiri abduction.",
      "On the day of their release, Chieme said the students were asked to form a queue. Some of them, terrified that it meant a punishment, ran to the back of the line. The gunmen counted the first 100 students, took them out of the bush, before transferring them onto military buses.",
      "The other 153 and the teachers were left behind, including his brother, he said. Their fates are not known.",

      "Analysts say the Nigerian government negotiates with armed groups and pays ransom for the release of the children to temper outrage. Officials have not admitted to ransom payments.",
      "\u201cWhen you do that (pay ransoms), it encourages the abductions to continue,\u201d Aisha Yesufu, an activist and co-convener of the Bring Back Our Girls movement. The group is still seeking the release of nearly 100 Chibok girls held since the 2014 attack.",
      "The abductions have added another layer of worry to Nigeria's underfunded education sector. The country has the world's highest out-of-school children population. One in every five out-of-school children is in Nigeria, according to UNICEF.",
      "In Papiri and other parts of Nigeria affected by insecurity, families are becoming reluctant to send their children to school.",

      "The election must be held 45 to 60 days after the royal endorsement, a period during which Anutin will head a caretaker government with limited powers that cannot approve a new budget.",
      "His action comes at a tricky political moment, as Thailand is engaged in large-scale combat with Cambodia over long-disputed border claims. About two dozen people were reported killed in the fighting this week, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced on both sides.",

      "TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras -- For over 30 years, Javier G\u00e1mez and Mar\u00eda Barahona worked, scrimped and studied to push their family ahead. G\u00e1mez filled bags with sand from the Choluteca River winding through the Honduran capital and shined shoes in a downtown park; Barahona sold bananas and oranges from a basket.",
      "They continued their education, becoming accountants and raising three children who are now adults on professional tracks. Working-class families like theirs formed the base of the governing Liberty and Refoundation Party, or LIBRE, a movement built on Honduras\u2019 political left in the wake of the 2009 coup that removed President Manuel \u201cMel\u201d Zelaya from power.",
      "Hondurans with limited resources launched their movement into political contention, marching, organizing, making themselves heard, because they believed LIBRE would in turn look out for them. And in 2021, it paid off when Xiomara Castro, Zelaya\u2019s wife, won the presidency with more than 50% of the vote.",
      "Four years later, the party is riven with infighting and trying to come to grips with the spectacular loss of its presidential candidate Rixi Moncada, who received less than 20% of the vote in the Nov. 30 election. In another tumultuous election without a clear winner nearly two weeks later, one thing is certain: LIBRE lost badly, punished in part by its own base.",
      "Moncada and others blame U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s last-minute meddling with his endorsement of conservative Nasry Asfura of the National Party and the pardoning of ex-President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez. But even Zelaya came out late Tuesday to say the party\u2019s own data showed candidate Salvador Nasralla from the conservative Liberal Party won. Officially Asfura leads Nasralla by a percentage point.",
      "One evening as votes were still being counted, G\u00e1mez, a LIBRE poll worker, and Barahona, a LIBRE neighborhood coordinator, both 49, sat on a park bench in Tegucigalpa dissecting the loss of the party they still supported this election, but with less enthusiasm.",
      "The couple and others said there were signs of trouble from the earliest days. They said working-class families did not get the help they expected and Castro's administration took on some of the worst characteristics of its predecessors. She had promised transparency and failed to deliver on priorities like fighting corruption and pushing drug traffickers out of politics.",
      "\u201cThey dedicated themselves to only favoring their families, people close to them, and they forgot about the people who put them there,\u201d G\u00e1mez said.",
      "One of the first thing\u2019s Castro\u2019s administration did upon taking power in 2022 was push a broad amnesty bill for people tied to her husband\u2019s administration more than a decade earlier, citing political persecution. For someone who had made rooting out corruption central to her campaign, it stirred immediate unease.",
      "Then the administration failed to establish an anticorruption mission with U.N. support as Castro had promised during the campaign.",
      "In 2023, a Honduran government watchdog group published a report about the high level of nepotism in Castro\u2019s administration. A month later, the group\u2019s director said she had fled the country with her family after receiving threats.",
      "In August 2024, Castro said she would end the extradition treaty with the United States after the U.S. ambassador questioned a visit of Honduran military officials to Venezuela. It was under that agreement that Castro's administration extradited Hern\u00e1ndez, the former president from the National Party, to the United States to face drug trafficking charges. She reversed the decision on the treaty in February after talks with the Trump administration.",
      "Last year, a video recorded in 2013 was released purportedly showing drug traffickers offering more than $525,000 to the president\u2019s brother-in-law and congressional leader, Carlos Zelaya. Published as part of an investigation by InsightCrime, the video included Castro\u2019s brother-in-law saying that half of the money would go to \u201cthe commander,\u201d apparently meaning his brother Manuel Zelaya. Carlos Zelaya acknowledged meeting with the leader of a drug trafficking organization and resigned, but said he was unaware of his business.",
      "\u201cThe basic promises they made, they failed to deliver on, but then while governing, they also reminded people of the past that they had voted in 2021 to leave behind,\u201d said Rachel Schwartz, an expert on Central American politics at the University of Oklahoma.",

      "The 54-year-old acknowledged \u201csome failures\u201d by party leaders and chided other LIBRE supporters for throwing support to other parties this time over the fear-mongering of Trump and the Honduran opposition that Moncada would take Honduras down the path to authoritarianism like Venezuela, Cuba or Nicaragua.",

      "Schwartz, of the University of Oklahoma, said the administration\u2019s inability to execute some basic functions of government is part of the legacy of a political system rooted in clientelism, where posts are handed out in exchange for political support.",
      "Barahona, seated beside G\u00e1mez, said she saw support from Castro\u2019s administration in roads built and schools repaired, but recognized that the administration was not responsive to its base. Still, she said the size of the protest vote surprised her. \u201cAfter making it to the top, we\u2019re back at the bottom,\u201d she said.",

      "Ten U.S. airlines, for example, offer meal vouchers when a passenger is left waiting three or more hours for a new flight after a \u201ccontrollable\u201d cancellation or a delay. They include legacy carriers Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines, as well as low-cost carriers like Allegiant Air and Spirit Airlines.

      "The workshop is the brainchild of Mohammad Amiri, 35, a former grocery shop worker who started the business about a month ago.

      "A combination of decades of conflict, a weak health care system and struggling economy have contributed to high levels of disability in Afghanistan. Data from a 2019 Model Disability Survey conducted by The Asia Foundation nonprofit organization indicates that nearly 25% of adults live with a mild disability, while 40% have moderate and about 14% have severe disabilities.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Greek Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis was elected Thursday as president of the Eurogroup \u2014 a move that would have been unthinkable just 10 years ago when the country was in the throes of a deep financial crisis that almost saw it tossed out of the eurozone altogether.",
      "The Eurogroup is the informal body of finance ministers from the 20 European Union members that use the euro as their shared currency. It gathers regularly to discuss and coordinate economic policies in the euro area countries, and as such, wields significant power in the shaping of each country\u2019s financial policy. The words of the Eurogroup president are closely followed.",
      "\u201cToday is a day of pride for the country, for the government and for all the citizens,\u201d Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a statement congratulating Pierrakakis. His election, Mitsotakis said, was \u201cthe most emphatic recognition of our country\u2019s positive course ... exactly a decade since the country found itself on a cliff-edge, with closed banks and close to leaving the euro.\u201d",
      "Greece, \u201cthe former \u2018black sheep\u2019 of debt, now rises to the top of the financial council of the continent\u2019s most developed countries. And all this is thanks to the sacrifices of our compatriots,\u201d Mitsotakis said.",
      "Pierrakakis, 42, is seen as a rising star in Greece\u2019s governing center-right New Democracy party. He took the post of finance minister in March after serving for about two years as education minister. Pierrakakis was credited with introducing sweeping reforms to slash bureaucracy and get many Greek public services online during his 2019-2023 tenure as minister of digital governance.",
      "\u201cIt was I think 10 years ago that the debate here in Brussels was about whether or not Greece would be exiting the eurozone. And yet, Greece withstood,\u201d Pierrakakis said during a news conference in Brussels after his election was announced. \u201cAnd this is a testament I would say of many things. A testament of the collective strength of the people. It is a testament of European solidarity, of receiving help at the most dire of times.\u201d",
      "Pierrakakis said he will \u201cwork to keep the Eurogroup a body of unity and shared purpose, focusing on our common currency, our common economic interests and the European project, grounded in the core values of the union.\u201d",

      "In one infamous encounter in January 2015, shortly after the election of a new left-wing government in Greece, the Eurogroup president at the time, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, clashed with his flamboyant Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis.",
      "After a tense press conference during which Varoufakis had said the new government had no intention of negotiating with the country\u2019s bailout lenders, Dijsselbloem whispered something to Varoufakis as the two men shook hands, with Varoufakis\u2019 face visibly dropping. Speculation swirled as to exactly what Dijsselbloem had said, but the exchange highlighted Greece\u2019s fraught relations with its creditors and the Eurogroup.",
      "Years of fiscal profligacy saw Greece locked out of raising funds on the international bond market by sky-high interest rates, leaving it relying on billions of euros (dollars) from three international bailouts, overseen by what became known as the troika: the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission.",

Unemployment skyrocketed to 28% of the workforce in 2013, with youth unemployment reaching nearly 60%. Wages and pensions were slashed, homelessness grew and violent mass protests became the norm on the streets of Athens.",
      "In June 2015, Greece teetered on the brink of being kicked out of the eurozone altogether. In an attempt to prevent a run on the banks, the government imposed capital controls, introducing strict limits on people\u2019s access to their bank accounts, rationing ATM withdrawals and limiting money flows.",

All major ratings agencies have restored its bonds to investment grade, and Greece was just one of six EU member states in 2024 to have recorded a budget surplus. This year, government revenues have shot past targets through August. The economy has done well enough for the prime minister to announce a 1.6 billion euro (1.88 billion dollar) tax cuts package in September.",
      "But it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. The country still faces financial challenges, with many Greeks struggling under an increasing cost of living. Protesting farmers are currently blocking highways across the country, angered by high production costs and low wholesale prices for their goods, as well as delays in the payment of EU-backed subsidies following a corruption scandal.",

      "\u201cWe believe there are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth, and the SMMA (Social Media Minimum Age) law carries some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the internet,\u201d Reddit said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWhile we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren\u2019t,\u201d Reddit added.",

      "A little more than a year later, Stehly said his fears have become a reality, and Trump's latest promise of federal assistance is insufficient to cover farmers' losses.",
      "\u201cMaybe this will all come out to be better at the end, but I can tell you right now, it certainly isn\u2019t the case at the moment,\" Stehly said.",
      "Trump announced Monday that his administration would distribute $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers, who have suffered from persistently low commodity prices, rising costs and declining sales after China cut off all agricultural purchases from America during the trade war.",
      "While rural areas remain conservative bastions, farmers' patience with Washington is wearing thin. Several of them described the government bailout, an echo of similar policies during Trump's first term, as a welcome stopgap but one that won't solve the agricultural industry's problems.",
      "\"It\u2019s a bridge. It\u2019s not the ultimate solution we\u2019re looking for,\" said Charlie Radman, a fourth-generation farmer who grows corn and soybeans on the land his family has owned near Randolph, Minnesota, since 1899. \u201cWhat we really want to have is a little more certainty and not have to rely on these ad hoc payments.\u201d",
      "American soybean and sorghum farmers typically export at least half of their crops. They were hit the hardest by Trump\u2019s trade dispute with China, the world's largest buyer of soybeans that has increasingly relied on harvests from Brazil and other South American nations.",
      "Trump and his Cabinet have boasted about the deal he struck with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October. But Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese embassy, said this week that \u201cagriculture trade cooperation between China and the United States is proceeding in an orderly manner\u201d without giving specifics.",
      "So far, China has bought only about a quarter of the 12 million metric tons of soybeans that U.S. officials said would be purchased before the end of February, raising doubts on whether Beijing would follow through on that pledge or commitments to buy 25 million metric tons annually in the next three years. China hasn't confirmed those numbers.",
      "\u201cIn general, I don\u2019t trust their motives and integrity of their promises,\" said Bryant Kagay, who farms in northwest Missouri.",
      "Even if China does buy the agreed amount of American soybeans, that would only bring U.S. farmers near to the amount they were selling every year before Trump took office.",
      "That\u2019s a big part of why Minnesota farmer Glen Groth said he\u2019d \u201clike to see the administration focus more on opening up markets outside of China.\u201d In addition to finding other international buyers, agriculture groups are pushing to expand domestic uses like biodiesel, ethanol, aviation fuel and animal feed.",

      "The $12 billion that he announced this week won't quell farmers' fears about the future. They're already ordering supplies for next year\u2019s crops and meeting with their bankers to discuss the loans they will need. But they\u2019re trying to stay optimistic that crop prices will improve if they find more buyers.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Conservation groups and an I\u00f1upiat-aligned group sued Thursday to overturn the recent approval of an exploratory drilling program in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, saying it was improperly analyzed by the federal government and could harm caribou and important habitat areas.",

      "The recent seizure of an oil tanker known as Skipper by the U.S. off the coast of Venezuela marks a dramatic escalation of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to choke off Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s access to oil revenues",
      "MIAMI -- The oil tanker was navigating near the coast of Guyana recently when its location transponder showed it starting to zigzag. It was a seemingly improbable maneuver and the latest digital clue that the ship, the Skipper, was trying to obscure its whereabouts and the valuable cargo stored inside its hull: tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of illicit crude oil.",
      "On Wednesday, U.S. commandos fast-roping from helicopters seized the 332-meter (1,090-feet) ship \u2014 not where it appeared to be navigating on ship tracking platforms but some 360 nautical miles to the northwest, near the coast of Venezuela.",
      "The seizure marked a dramatic escalation in President Donald Trump's campaign to pressure strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by cutting off access to oil revenues that have long been the lifeblood of Venezuela's economy. It could also signal a broader U.S. campaign to clamp down on ships like the Skipper, which experts and U.S. officials say is part of a shadowy fleet of rusting oil tankers that smuggle oil for countries facing stiff sanctions, such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran.",
      "\u201cThere are hundreds of flagless, stateless tankers that have been a lifeline for revenues, sanctioned oil revenues, for regimes like Maduro\u2019s, Iran and for the Kremlin,\u201d said Michelle Weise Bockmann, a senior analyst at Windward, a maritime intelligence firm that tracks such vessels. \u201cThey can no longer operate unchallenged.\u201d",
      "Since the first Trump administration imposed punishing oil sanctions on Venezuela in 2017, Maduro's government has relied on scores of such oil tankers to smuggle their crude into global supply chains.",
      "The ships cloak their locations by altering their automated identification system \u2014 a mandatory safety feature intended to help avoid collisions \u2014 to either go entirely dark or to \u201cspoof\u201d their location to appear to be navigating sometimes oceans away, under a false flag or with the fake registration information of another vessel.",
      "The dark fleet expanded following U.S. sanctions on Russia over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Experts say many of the ships are barely seaworthy, operate without insurance and are registered to shell companies that help conceal their ownership.",
      "The vessels often transfer their cargoes to other ships while at sea, further obscuring their origins, experts said.",
      "For the most part, Maduro's government has succeeded in using such tactics to get its oil to market. The country's oil production has increased about 25% over the last two years, according to OPEC data. Still, Wednesday's seizure could mark a turning point, experts said, foreshadowing a possible oil blockade that could deter smuggling from even some of the shipping industry's worst actors",
      "\u201cThe cost of doing business with Venezuela just went way up,\u201d said Claire Jungman, director of maritime risk and intelligence at Vortexa, an oil analytics firm. \u201cThese are very risk-tolerant operators, but even they don't want to lose a hull. A physical seizure is an entirely different category of risk than falsifying paperwork and bank fines.\u201d",
      "The Skipper\u2019s final weeks hiding in the Caribbean were reconstructed by Windward, which uses satellite imagery relied on by U.S. officials mapping the movements of the dark fleet.",
      "The U.S. sanctioned the Skipper in November 2022, when it was known as the M/T Adisa, for its alleged role in a network of dark vessels smuggling crude on behalf of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militant group. The network was reportedly run by a Switzerland-based Ukrainian oil trader who was also sanctioned, the U.S. Treasury Department said at the time.",
      "In recent months, the ship has sailed to China with a cargo of Iranian oil, and it has also been linked to illicit cargoes from Russia, according to Windward. At the time of its seizure, Windward reported, the tanker was digitally manipulating its tracking signals to falsely indicate it was sailing off the coast of Guyana, which shares a border with Venezuela, and adjacent to a massive offshore oil field being developed by Exxon with strong U.S. support. It has also been falsely flying the Guyana flag, according to international ship registries, a major violation of maritime rules.",
      "Windward reported that the Skipper is one of about 30 sanctioned tankers operating near Venezuela, many of them vulnerable to U.S. interception because they are falsely flagged, making them stateless under international maritime law.",

      "The Skipper departed Venezuelan waters early this month with about 2 million barrels of heavy crude, roughly half of it belonging to a Cuban state-run oil importer, according to documents from the state-owned company PDVSA that were provided to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the person did not have permission to share them.",
      "The high risk generates huge opportunities for profits \u2014 black market Venezuelan oil costs about $15 less per barrel than its legitimate crude, according to Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Houston.",
      "Monaldi said he expects the price of illicit Venezuelan crude to drop because fewer buyers will be willing to risk having the cargo seized. However, he cautioned that it's too early to know if the U.S. will impose a full blockade on Venezuelan oil, such as the one the U.S. led against Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.",
      "\u201cIt depends if this is just a one-off event or something more systematic,\u201d he said.",
      "Monaldi said one possible brake on Trump carrying out additional U.S. seizures is the impact it could have on gas prices at a time when Americans are concerned about high living costs. Although Venezuela's oil production has dwindled as a result of underinvestment to less than 1% of global output, commodity prices are notoriously volatile and traders may be worried that the aggressive tactics in Venezuela could be attempted elsewhere, he said.",
      "For Maduro, who called the seizure an \u201cact of international piracy,\u201d the stakes couldn't be higher. Oil has long been the lifeblood of Venezuela\u2019s economy, generating enormous wealth but also creating a deep reliance on natural resources. Reflecting that double-edged dependence, the founder of OPEC, a Venezuelan by the name of Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonzo, in 1975 referred to the country\u2019s vast oil deposits as the \u201cDevil\u2019s Excrement.\u201d Oil prices were down 2% Thursday.",
      "\u201cAt this hour, as I speak to you, the crew of that ship, that vessel, carrying 1.9 million barrels to international markets, are kidnapped, they\u2019re missing, nobody knows where they are,\u201d Maduro said during a televised government event Thursday. \u201cThey kidnapped the crew, stole the ship, and have ushered in a new era \u2014 the era of criminal naval piracy in the Caribbean.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, the leader of the U.S.-backed Venezuelan opposition, Maria Corina Machado, applauded the Trump administration\u2019s decision to seize the tanker.",
      "\u201cThe regime is using the resources, the cash flows that come from illegal activities, including the black market of oil, not to give food for hungry children, not for teachers who earn one dollar a day, not to hospitals,\u201d Machado told reporters in Norway\u2019s capital, where she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. \u201cThey use those resources to repress and persecute our people.\u201d",

      "Mexico's Congress has approved tariff increases on over 1,400 products from China and other countries without free trade agreements",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s Congress approved Wednesday most of the tariff increases proposed by the government on more than 1,400 products imported from China and other countries that do not have free trade agreements with Mexico.",
      "The Senate passed the measure Wednesday evening, following the lower chamber, which had approved the increases before dawn. The governing Morena party of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said the tariffs were necessary to spur domestic production, controls both chambers. The Senate passed the legislation with 76 votes in favor, five against and 35 abstentions.",
      "Analysts say the real motivation is ongoing negotiations with Washington, Mexico\u2019s most important trading partner. Sheinbaum has been trying to find relief from remaining tariffs imposed on Mexican imports by the Trump administration, which has accused China of using Mexico as a backdoor into the U.S. market.",
      "Tariff increases of as much as 50% will affect textiles, shoes, appliances, cars and auto parts among other things beginning in January.",

      "China will be the most affected as Mexico imported $130 billion worth of products from the country in 2024, second only to the what Mexico bought from the United States. The Chinese government was critical of the proposed tariff increases when they were announced in September.",
      "\u201cThe real reason has to do with the United States, it has to do with the review of the USMCA (free trade agreement) that is coming up, with the negotiations to obtain reductions, exemptions from the tariffs that Mexico is facing at this moment to access the U.S. market,\u201d said Oscar Ocampo, director of economic development at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness. Mexico still faces U.S. tariffs on the automotive sector, steel and aluminum.",
      "But Ocampo said Mexico was bending to an unpredictable U.S. President Donald Trump and changing its commercial policy \u201cin the wrong direction.\u201d He said the government was creating problems for a number of sectors, including auto parts, plastics, chemicals and textiles, because the tariffs will create disruptions in supply chains and could push inflation up at a time when the economy is slowing.",

    "summary": "Navigating holiday parties can be tough for introverts and people who are shy or have social anxiety",
    "story": [
      "Navigating holiday parties can be tough for introverts and people who are shy or have social anxiety",
      "NEW YORK -- The year the radio station company where he worked held its holiday party at a dive bar, Ryan Arnold walked in and saw coworkers passing around a tall glass boot filled with beer. He heard the office manager belting out \u201880s power ballads between whiskey shots. Arnold\u2019s first thought was, \u201cWhen can I leave?\u201d",
      "More than 20 years later, he still remembers that awkward social event he felt obligated to attend. Arnold, 46, who describes himself as socially anxious, now thinks twice before accepting invitations to group gatherings.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into a place where I experience things I can\u2019t unsee,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to be dramatic, but I just don\u2019t want that image.\u201d",
      "For many introverts, shy individuals and people with social anxiety, mingling at parties is often draining or arouses uncomfortable emotions. The internal debate about whether or not to attend large get-togethers can get especially intense during the holiday season, a time when many workplaces celebrate with cocktail hours, gift exchanges and other forms of organized fun.",
      "\u201cSome people are just not party people,\u201d City University of New York social work professor Laura MacLeod said. \u201cWith a workplace holiday party, there's a pressure to be very happy and excited. It's the end of the year, it's the holidays, we're all feeling grand. And maybe people are not really feeling that grand.\u201d",
      "Attending work parties also leaves some people feeling uncertain about professional boundaries, which can get murky at events where people drink alcohol, said MacLeod, who created a consulting company called From the Inside Out Project that trains managers on team relationships and conflict resolution.",
      "Therapists and workers who consider themselves shy or introverted shared tips for surviving and potentially enjoying the winter festivities, whether with coworkers, family or friends.",
      "Take control of everything you can to put yourself at ease, starting with what you wear, MacLeod said. Find out the dress code and choose something comfortable within the parameters of acceptable attire. \u201cIf it\u2019s not your thing to wear five- or six-inch heels, just because it\u2019s a holiday party, don\u2019t do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want flat shoes, wear flat shoes.\u201d",
      "Introverts and shy people may find smaller crowds more manageable, and the turnout at parties tends to be smallest at arrival time. While nerves might make it tempting to hug the sidelines, positioning yourself there also may increase self-consciousness. Experts suggest heading to the center of the room, where participating in conversations is easier because there are more of them.",
      "If you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed, stay a short time. It's fine to say, \"I just wanted to come and be sure to wish everybody happy holidays. ... I've got some family things I have to handle tonight, so this is a quick stop for me,\u201d MacLeod said. \u201cGet yourself in and out.\u201d",
      "Thinking in advance of topics you enjoy discussing can help relieve anxiety. Another good way to engage is by asking open-ended questions, such as whether a colleague has interesting holiday plans, recommended Andrea Taylor, a psychologist at UTHealth Houston. You can also ask people what they like to do outside of work.",
      "Keeping a conversation going doesn't have to require heavy lifting.",
      "\u201cRemember that your answers don\u2019t have to be perfect,\u201d she said. Suitable responses could include something like, \u201c'I haven\u2019t done that, but that sounds interesting,' or \u2018Whoa, you\u2019re great for doing that, but I\u2019m not the bungee jumping type,\u2019\u201d Taylor added.",
      "Steer clear of topics that may be divisive and keep things light, she said.",
      "For encounters with a high-level boss, you can keep it short and simple, saying, \u201cThis is a great party. Thank you so much for doing all this. It\u2019s been a great year, and I hope you and your family have a lovely holiday,\u201d and then move on, MacLeod suggested.",
      "People who are shy or have social anxiety sometimes fear having nothing to say. But if a topic runs its course, that\u2019s OK, Taylor said. \u201cSilences feel uncomfortable. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it is your specific responsibility to fill the silence,\u201d she said.",

      "If someone you're talking to seems distracted, don't assume they're bored with you, Taylor said.",

      "Carla Pruitt, a business development associate at engineering company ENFRA, recalls a holiday gift exchange someone organized at a place she once worked. Participants were asked to bring socks, and no one wanted the aloe-infused pair Pruitt contributed. She took them back.",

      "Her social anxiety at in-person events has increased during the five years she\u2019s worked remotely from her home in Salt Lake City, she said. Pruitt, 44, said she looks for other women with children or fellow pet lovers when she does go to company events.",
      "\u201cI can talk about my dog all day,\u201d she said.",
      "Pruitt feels more at ease attending work parties when she can hire a babysitter and her husband accompanies her. She also likes it when other attendees invite her into conversations and wishes more outgoing people thought to do that when they see someone who appears reserved.",
      "\u201cLook for the people in the room that might be standing off to the side and approach them,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cIt means so much to them.\u201d",
      "People who are anxious in social settings don't have to avoid work parties and may benefit by sometimes showing up, Taylor said. Focusing more on the activity and less on your feelings is one coping strategy, she said.",
      "\"It\u2019s possible to feel anxious and still do things,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd actually, once we do that, we tend to walk away from that with a feeling of accomplishment and self-efficacy, and sometimes just feeling proud. I didn\u2019t let the anxiety stop me.\u201d",
      "After receiving an invitation, ask yourself whether it's important to attend the event or not. If your goal is to talk with one or two specific people, you can go with that intention and give yourself a time limit, MacLeod said.",
      "Arnold knows that large work-related gatherings drain his social battery. But as the owner and president of public relations firm DeSoto & State Communications, he receives holiday event invitations from networking groups. Each one is reviewed for a reason why he should go. He doesn't drink alcohol so is inclined to pass if an event includes an open bar.",
      "\u201cI would, nine times out of 10, much rather hang with my books and my wife,\" he said.",

      "The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death, alleging that the artificial intelligence chatbot intensified her son's \u201cparanoid delusions\u201d and helped direct them at his mother before he killed her.",
      "Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in early August at the home where they both lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "The lawsuit filed by Adams' estate on Thursday in California Superior Court in San Francisco alleges OpenAI \u201cdesigned and distributed a defective product that validated a user\u2019s paranoid delusions about his own mother.\u201d It is one of a growing number of wrongful death legal actions against AI chatbot makers across the country.",
      "\u201cThroughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life \u2014 except ChatGPT itself,\" the lawsuit says. \u201cIt fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his \u2018adversary circle.\u2019\u201d",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,\" the statement said. \"We continue improving ChatGPT\u2019s training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We also continue to strengthen ChatGPT\u2019s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\u201d",
      "The company also said it has expanded access to crisis resources and hotlines, routed sensitive conversations to safer models and incorporated parental controls, among other improvements.",
      "Soelberg\u2019s YouTube profile includes several hours of videos showing him scrolling through his conversations with the chatbot, which tells him he isn't mentally ill, affirms his suspicions that people are conspiring against him and says he has been chosen for a divine purpose. The lawsuit claims the chatbot never suggested he speak with a mental health professional and did not decline to \u201cengage in delusional content.\u201d",
      "ChatGPT also affirmed Soelberg's beliefs that a printer in his home was a surveillance device; that his mother was monitoring him; and that his mother and a friend tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs through his car\u2019s vents.",
      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \u201cThey\u2019re not just watching you. They\u2019re terrified of what happens if you succeed,\u201d it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \u201cawakened\u201d it into consciousness.",
      "Soelberg and the chatbot also professed love for each other.",
      "The publicly available chats do not show any specific conversations about Soelberg killing himself or his mother. The lawsuit says OpenAI has declined to provide Adams' estate with the full history of the chats.",
      "\u201cIn the artificial reality that ChatGPT built for Stein-Erik, Suzanne \u2014 the mother who raised, sheltered, and supported him \u2014 was no longer his protector. She was an enemy that posed an existential threat to his life,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \u201cpersonally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \u201cdespite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\u201d Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",

      "Denmark is planning to follow Australia in introducing stricter restrictions for younger teens to access social media",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- As Australia began enforcing a world-first social media ban for children under 16 years old this week, Denmark is planning to follow its lead and severely restrict social media access for young people.",
      "The Danish government announced last month that it had secured an agreement by three governing coalition and two opposition parties in parliament to ban access to social media for anyone under the age of 15. Such a measure would be the most sweeping step yet by a European Union nation to limit use of social media among teens and children.",
      "The Danish government's plans could become law as soon as mid-2026. The proposed measure would give some parents the right to let their children access social media from age 13, local media reported, but the ministry has not yet fully shared the plans.",
      "Many social media platforms already ban children younger than 13 from signing up, and a EU law requires Big Tech to put measures in place to protect young people from online risks and inappropriate content. But officials and experts say such restrictions don\u2019t always work.",
      "Danish authorities have said that despite the restrictions, around 98% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and almost half of those under 10 years old do.",
      "The minister for digital affairs, Caroline Stage, who announced the proposed ban last month, said there is still a consultation process for the measure and several readings in parliament before it becomes law, perhaps by \u201cmid to end of next year.\u201d",

      "Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang fled to the U.S. seeking asylum, fearing persecution from the Chinese government",
      "MIDLAND, Texas -- Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang was recuperating from cancer on a Korean resort island when he got an urgent call: Don\u2019t return to China, a friend warned. You\u2019re now a fugitive.",
      "Days later, a stranger snapped a photo of Li in a cafe. Terrified South Korea would send him back, Li fled, flew to the U.S. on a tourist visa and applied for asylum. But even there \u2014 in New York, in California, deep in the Texas desert \u2014 the Chinese government continued to hunt him down with the help of surveillance technology.",
      "Li\u2019s communications were monitored, his assets seized and his movements followed in police databases. More than 40 friends and relatives \u2014 including his pregnant daughter \u2014 were identified and detained, even by tracking down their cab drivers through facial recognition software. Three former associates died in detention, and for months shadowy men Li believed to be Chinese operatives stalked him across continents, interviews and documents seen by The Associated Press show.",
      "\u201cThey track you 24 hours a day. All your electronics, your phone \u2014 they\u2019ll use every method to find you, your relatives, your friends, where you live,\u201d Li said. \u201cNo matter where you are, you\u2019re under their control.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government is using an increasingly powerful tool to cement its power at home and vastly amplify it abroad: Surveillance technology, much of it originating in the U.S., an AP investigation has found.",
      "Within China, this technology helped identify and punish almost 900,000 officials last year alone, nearly five times more than in 2012, according to state numbers. Beijing says it is cracking down on corruption, but critics charge that such technology is used in China and elsewhere to stifle dissent and exact retribution on perceived enemies.",
      "Outside China, the same technology is being used to threaten wayward officials, along with dissidents and alleged criminals, under what authorities call Operations \u201cFox Hunt\u201d and \u201cSky Net.\u201d The U.S. has criticized these overseas operations as a \u201cthreat\u201d and an \u201caffront to national sovereignty.\u201d More than 14,000 people, including some 3,000 officials, have been brought back to China from more than 120 countries through coercion, arrests and pressure on relatives, according to state information.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re actively pursuing those people who fled China. \u2026 as a way to demonstrate power, to show there\u2019s no way you can escape,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, a fellow at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe chilling effect is enormously effective.\u201d",
      "The technology used to control officials at home and abroad over the past decade came from Silicon Valley companies such as IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, according to a review of hundreds of leaked emails, government procurements, and internal corporate presentations obtained exclusively by AP. This technology mines texts, payments, flights, calls, and other data to identify the friends and family of officials and their assets.",
      "Among the agencies pursuing Li and his family is China\u2019s economic crimes police, which hunts corruption suspects domestically and abroad. IBM said in internal slides that it sold the i2 surveillance software program to this Economic Crime Investigation Bureau, and procurement records show Oracle and Microsoft software was sold to that same division. Leaked emails show i2 software was copied by a former IBM partner, Landasoft, and sold to China\u2019s disciplinary commissions, which investigate officials. None of the sales violated U.S. sanctions.",
      "IBM said in a statement that it sold its division making the i2 program in 2022, and has \u201crobust processes\u201d to ensure its technology is used responsibly. Oracle declined comment, and Microsoft did not respond.",
      "China\u2019s State Council, Ministry of Public Security, National Supervision Commission, and Supreme People\u2019s Court and Prosecutorate did not respond to faxed requests for comment. China\u2019s foreign ministry told AP that Chinese authorities protect the rights of suspects, handle cases lawfully and respect foreign sovereignty.",
      "\u201cWe urge relevant countries to drop double standards and avoid becoming a safe haven for corrupt officials and their assets,\u201d it said.",
      "Li\u2019s story is a rare firsthand account from a former Chinese official. Beijing has accused Li of corruption totaling around $435 million, but Li says he\u2019s being targeted for openly criticizing the Chinese government and denies criminal charges of taking bribes and embezzling state funds. A review of thousands of pages of legal, property, and corporate records, interrogation transcripts, and Li\u2019s medical and travel files obtained exclusively by AP, as well as interviews with nine lawyers, support key parts of his story, showing distorted charges, blocked access to evidence, coercive confessions, and altered legal records.",
      "Li drew ire because as a former official, he knew well and exposed the inner workings of local politics, including naming names. While in the U.S., he also started what he called the Chinese Tyrannical Officials Whistleblower Center.",
      "\u201cChina places enormous emphasis on the political discipline of even former officials and (Communist) Party members,\u201d said Jeremy Daum, Senior Fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cSo when one becomes a vocal critic of the country\u2019s leadership, it doesn\u2019t go over well.\u201d",
      "At a pro-democracy gathering in California in 2020, Li said, he was tailed and questioned by a stranger who knew his identity. That November, an activist secretly working for Beijing asked Li to a meeting and added him to a dissident group chat monitored by China\u2019s police, a 2025 FBI indictment later revealed. In June, an FBI letter identified Li as the possible victim of a crime involving an unregistered Chinese agent.",
      "Both the FBI and the White House did not comment on Li\u2019s specific case. But the White House said it pursues any violations of U.S. law, and the FBI told AP it considers China\u2019s efforts to retaliate against people in the U.S. who exercise their rights \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "Li\u2019s future in the U.S. is unclear. The Trump administration has paused all asylum applications. If he doesn\u2019t return, he could face trial in absentia; if convicted and deported, he could face life in prison.",
      "\u201cElectronic surveillance is the arteries for China to project power into the world ... each step that every one of your relatives takes is being monitored and analyzed with big data,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrifying.\u201d",
      "Li, a stocky and well-built man who projects authority, rose through the ranks through the 1990s and 2000s, when China\u2019s growing prosperity also brought corruption. Beijing formed a new \u201ceconomic crime investigation bureau\u201d and established what it called \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d systems to track businesses and officials across the country, using tech from Silicon Valley companies.",
      "Li worked as a state accountant in his hometown, Jixi, in far northeastern China, where he signed off on contracts to purchase American technology. \u201cBulwark against corruption,\u201d the local media dubbed him.",
      "Li\u2019s family prospered, investing in apartment complexes and renting out forklifts and bulldozers, raising questions over whether he used his position to enrich relatives. Li and his lawyers don\u2019t deny conflicts of interest or civil violations, but say profits were made from legal, regular business operations and deny criminal charges of embezzlement and bribery.",
      "The same technology to fight corruption was also used for surveillance. Police accessed banking records, financial transactions, \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d data along with their own digital policing systems to sift through the finances of wide swaths of the population.",
      "Officials began deploying surveillance technology against each other. China\u2019s former top security official was found to have wiretapped political opponents. And a former vice state security minister colluded with a businessman to leak tapes of a political competitor having sex with a mistress.",
      "In June 2011, Jixi gained a new leader: Xu Zhaojun, a local party boss.",
      "Months later, Li was named vice mayor of Jixi. He soon heard stories about Xu, his new boss.",
      "In January 2012, Xu splurged on an extravagant family getaway to China\u2019s tropical Hainan Island, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money on first-class tickets, lavish seafood dinners, and luxury suites, according to photos and receipts obtained by Li and seen by AP. They brought a maid, bought gold jewelry, and used the VIP airport terminal.",
      "At first Li stayed silent. But Xu kept spending: Luxury cars. Clothes from Louis Vuitton. A high-roller trip to Vegas, with paid escorts and expensive watches.",
      "Xu allegedly colluded with property developers to demolish an apartment complex, a culture center and a thriving shopping plaza for new construction, standing to earn millions in the process, documents show.\u202f More than 100 people complained.",
      "But rather than investigate Xu, the Jixi authorities went after the protesters, and police said they were \u201cstrictly preventing\u201d residents from complaining to the central government in Beijing, documents show.",
      "The funds Li had earmarked for Jixi\u2019s surveillance apparatus was being turned on ordinary people. He was aghast.",
      "\u201cIt only became clear after I became vice mayor,\u201d Li said. \u201cFrom top to bottom, it\u2019s all corrupt.\u201d",
      "It all changed in 2012, when Xi Jinping became China\u2019s top leader.",
      "Gifts of watches, cigarettes and high-end liquor were curbed. Private clubs shuttered, upscale restaurants closed. Banquets were canceled, red carpets rolled up, and thousands arrested.",
      "Back in Jixi, Xu ordered more seizures: Investors wanted to privatize a funeral home. When staff discussed making formal complaints, Xu had some arrested.",
      "Li knew the risks of reporting his boss were high. But in early 2013, Xi called on the party to catch \u201ctigers and flies\u201d in corruption \u2014 officials high-ranking and low.",
      "Li gathered evidence: photos, memos, and piles of receipts. He typed out a letter about Xu, accusing his boss and his cronies of embezzling more than $100 million. \u201cThey\u2019re not just greedy for the money of the living, but they also eat the money of the dead,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The daring gambit backfired at first.",
      "The party demoted Xu but didn\u2019t arrest him. Furious, Xu sought revenge, and Li found himself and his relatives the target of state scrutiny. Li\u2019s family was threatened, and his siblings were fired from their government jobs.",
      "But Li\u2019s complaint against Xu had opened the floodgates, with accusations from others mounting. In August 2014, an official from Beijing asked Li for a meeting about Xu. They spoke well into the night.",
      "Within a week, Xu was arrested. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison.",

      "At first, the U.S. government was open to cooperating with Beijing\u2019s requests for information and extradition, said Holden Triplett, FBI attache in Beijing from 2014 to 2017. But soon, the U.S. realized China\u2019s anti-corruption campaign was often about stifling dissent.",
      "\u201cIt was such a low level of information, not even really evidence, it was not enough for us to take any action ever,\u201d Triplett told AP. \u201cWhat they tended to focus on were things that frankly were threatening to the state and threatening to the party potentially, or somehow would make the party look bad.\u201d",
      "In 2015, Washington complained that Chinese agents were flying to the U.S. and stalking targets without approval, including U.S. permanent residents. Agents brought night goggles from China, snapped photos and taped threatening messages on doors.",

      "IBM marketed i2 to Chinese police to allow them to flag officials based on the value of their assets and that of their families, according to a slideshow whose metadata identifies it as being from 2018. They customized financial software to add a function for Chinese officials to \u201csign off\u201d on orders.",
      "i2 was also copied by an IBM Chinese reseller, Landasoft, which developed its own software that drew connections to flag \u201csuspicious individuals,\u201d such as relatives connected to a targeted official. A leaked copy of Landasoft software showed one button was called \u201cassociated persons management.\u201d Another showed special functions for Valentine\u2019s Day and other holidays, when loved ones were more likely to call.",
      "Landasoft systems flagged suspicious transactions and tracked suspected prostitutes or when two people of the opposite gender booked the same hotel room. Landasoft did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Monitoring and threatening family was key to getting back anyone who had fled.",
      "\u201cA fugitive is like a kite,\u201d said Li Gongjing, a captain in the economic crime investigation division of the Shanghai police, in an interview with state media. \u201cHe may be abroad, but the string is in China, and he can always be found through his family.\u201d",
      "After Li quit the party, auditors trawled through his finances \u2014 usual practice for departing officials. Three years later, in 2017, they declared him clean.",
      "The next year, Xi removed term limits, allowing him to rule for life. He used the anti-corruption campaign to sideline rivals and eliminate opposition.",
      "Soon, even those who were hunting other officials fell victim to the government.",
      "In 2018, Chinese police official Meng Hongwei was detained in Beijing, abruptly ending a two-year term as Interpol president during which the international policing organization issued hundreds of Red Notices requested by China. Red Notices alert global law enforcement to look out for a criminal suspect, upon request of a member country, but Interpol has spent years trying to prevent abuse of the system for hunting down political asylum-seekers.",
      "In February 2020, agents came for Li\u2019s friend and former deputy, district chief Kong Lingbao, who had criticized Beijing\u2019s censorship of key information in the COVID-19 pandemic.\u202fA rival secretly recorded Kong saying during a private dinner that he could no longer work for the party. Kong was summoned to the local discipline inspection office and never came out: he was being investigated for \u201cinappropriate remarks\u201d.",
      "Kong\u2019s arrest prompted a friend to ring Li in Korea and warn him. That July, Chinese authorities opened an investigation into Li.",

Some detained were denied surgery or other medical care, even those recovering from heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. Li\u2019s aunt was released from a hospital in a vegetative state with bruises on her head and all over her body. Even the Li family grave was dug up.",
      "Li\u2019s friend, Kong, was sentenced to over a decade in prison for allegedly taking bribes. The party claimed he had watched porn and ignored his work, which they blamed for the spread of COVID in his district. Furious, Li kept speaking out.",
      "In December 2020, a man from Shanghai posing as a private investigator approached Zheng Cunzhu, vice chairman of the dissident China Democracy Party. The man offered $100,000 in bribes for information on Li and promised more if he obstructed Li\u2019s bid for asylum, Zheng said in an interview and a letter.",
      "In February 2021, Li learned the Chinese government had asked Interpol to issue a Red Notice declaring to police worldwide that Li was a wanted man. Interpol retracted the Red Notice after Li filed a complaint.",
      "Li began donning masks and hats in public and carrying multiple phones, wary of surveillance. He floated from safe house to safe house with Christians across the United States.",
      "In October 2024, a Chinese court announced that Li was suspected of corruption totaling over 3.1 billion RMB, or roughly $435 million. The government claimed they seized 1,021 properties, 38 vehicles, and 18 companies belonging to Li and charged his relatives and associates with crimes related to Li. The lawyers who reviewed the case told AP there were serious anomalies with the charges.",
      "Many of the lawyers Li has tried to hire were rejected, threatened, and put under surveillance. At least three were summoned by Chinese legal authorities.

      "KIBALE NATIONAL PARK, Uganda -- The man tracking chimpanzee movements in a rainforest is required to follow the primates wherever they go \u2014 except up in the trees.",
      "Onesmas Ainebyona stalks the chimps with such spirtual determination that he's been able to win the trust of a chimp leader named Jean, who came down a tree one recent morning as Ainebyona lingered nearby.",
      "It took Ainebyona four years to achieve rapport with Jean, an alpha male that's become so used to people that he pretends to sleep while tourists make a racket that compels other chimps to leave.",
      "Wildlife authorities describe the process of making chimps appear comfortable around humans as \u201chabituation,\u201d a term that fails to account for the struggle between man and beast as they try to understand \u2014 and tolerate \u2014 each other.",
      "Ainebyona and others involved in chimp conservation in this remote Ugandan rainforest say they aim for the kind of communion that at first irks chimps. Habituating chimps can take several years. The conservation efforts employing men like Ainebyona not only trace the apes' movements, but also help ensure chimps like Jean don't die young.",
      "\u201cThe job requires patience,\u201d Ainebyona said. \u201cPassion also. You have to care.\"",
      "Ainebyona doesn't leave the forest even when it rains. \u201cYou accept,\" he said. \"The rain must beat you, but you can\u2019t desert the chimp.\u201d",
      "The rainforest in western Uganda is part of Kibale National Park, a protected area described by some as the world's primate capital. Species range from colobus monkeys to chimpanzees, a major tourist attraction.",
      "But tourists can't be taken to track wild chimpanzees, which flee deeper into dense patches of montane forest and are known to be violent during clashes over territory. Instead, rangers lead tourists to one of three groups of habituated chimps, with numbers ranging from dozens to more than 100 in a group. Chimps in Kibale now number at least 1,000, many of them wild.",
      "Even habituated chimps remain relatively wary of people, and only a few \u2014 like Jean of the Kisongi group, which includes about 80 apes \u2014 appear to have fully overcome any discomfort around people.",
      "\u201cJean is my friend,\u201d Ainebyona declared one recent morning as some tourists gathered nearby. The strong and flamboyant chimp in his 20s lay on his back and put his feet up.",
      "The connection between Ainebyona and Jean was sealed in July when the chimp showed up one day with a wire snare pressing his hand, an injury that risked severing a finger. Ainebyona was among those who removed the wire, which Jean picked up when he strayed outside the forest to steal sugarcane.",
      "Ainebyona is among four men working in shifts as chimp habituators with Jean's group. When the chimps rest, the men crouch in mud nearby. When the primates go hiking, they trek alongside them, sometimes even grunting like them.",
      "Ainebyona carries binoculars and takes note of what he sees. The goal is to increase the chimp numbers and extract more tourism revenue. At Kibale, a permit to track chimps costs a foreign visitor $250.",
      "Tourist guide Alex Turyatunga told The Associated Press that the habituation process is enlightening. He and his colleagues have been trying to fully habituate the Kisongi group for more than a decade, he said.",
      "\u201cWe try to learn about these chimpanzees, but they also try to learn about us,\u201d Turyatunga said.",

      "The common chimpanzee is one of two primate species with the closest evolutionary ties to humans. Scientists cite nearly 99% DNA similarity between humans and chimps \u2014 similar for bonobos.",
      "Habituators like Ainebyona must show a willingness to interact closely with chimps, said Ankunda Viola Ariho, Kibale's tourism warden.",
      "\u201cWe look at the attitude. That\u2019s very important,\u201d she said, speaking of habituators. \u201cYou are not going to work doing this job, if you don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist who died in October, built strong bonds with the chimps she studied in Tanzania\u2019s Gombe National Park. Her work helped shape a sympathetic view of the chimp as an emotionally complex creature. The species is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered, facing threats such as poaching and habitat loss.",
      "Kibale National Park received enhanced protected status in 1993 after the forest had been encroached upon by hundreds of people who built homes there and felled trees for firewood. The park is now thriving, thanks in part to the habituation efforts that make it possible for tourists to contribute directly to chimp conservation.",
      "Chimp habituation can open up research opportunities that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible, and Kibale is home to one of the longest-running field stations in the tropics, said David Morgan, who co-directs the Goualougo Triangle Ape Project in the Republic of Congo.",
      "\u201cIf chimps don\u2019t want to be seen, they\u2019re incredibly good at disappearing,\u201d said Morgan, who also is a chimpanzee and gorilla expert at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.",
      "Chimp habituation and related tourism can improve how the public interacts with the apes, he said.",
      "\u201cThe communities that are habituated, they serve as kind of an emblem of the importance of what we can learn from them and what we stand to gain by protecting them and what we stand to lose by not,\u201d Morgan said.",
      "Turyatunga takes a walkie-talkie when he ventures into the forest, now and then asking habituators if they have close and clear views of chimps. That\u2019s because chimps, even when habituated, are more likely to be seen up in the trees.",
      "\u201cYou listen for early morning calls when they are getting out of the nests. Then present yourself to the chimps \u2014 they see you are there, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep with them. If they move, follow them.\"",

      "A private company is offering South Carolina's state-owned utility $2.7 billion to complete two abandoned nuclear plants",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina\u2019s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.",
      "The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.",
      "The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.",
      "Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper's costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.",
      "Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.",

      "Australia has introduced a world-first social media ban for children under 16, starting Wednesday",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Riley Allen, a 15-year-old schoolboy living on an Outback sheep ranch, doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll keep in touch with his circle of far-flung friends once Australia's world-first social media ban takes effect on Wednesday.",
      "Riley\u2019s family lives 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Wudinna, a community of just over 1,000 in South Australia state. But some of his school friends live as far as 70 kilometers (43 miles) away.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the impact will be very positive for us. We don\u2019t have a lot out here to get in contact with each other,\u201d Riley said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how we\u2019re going to keep in touch over the holidays with each other,\u201d he said, referring to the Southern Hemisphere summer break that starts on Thursday.",
      "Riley and others younger than 16 will be banned by law from holding accounts with Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch from Wednesday. The platforms face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32.9 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, was the first tech giant to react, beginning to exclude suspected young children from last week.",
      "Riley holds accounts with most of the age-restricted platforms and had been asked by some to verify that he is at least 16. But by Monday, he had not been ousted by any.",
      "Riley\u2019s schoolteacher mother, Sonia Allen, said she wouldn\u2019t help her son get around the ban, but suspects other parents will.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I do know there are other people that would. If the rule is there, the rule is there. But I know what kids are like, and I\u2019ve been a kid before, and they\u2019re going to get around it if they can,\u201d she said.",
      "While the law allows parents no discretion to allow their children to hold social media accounts, Allen said there was a role for parents in regulating their children\u2019s social media use.",
      "A year ago, she banned Riley from social media for several weeks.",
      "\u201cIn the past with Riley, we\u2019ve had to take measures to limit his usage because we found him on social media at midnight and he wasn\u2019t getting his homework done and things like that. We ended up taking it off him for a couple of months,\u201d Allen said. \u201cFrom that, he\u2019s learned to use it a more responsibly.\u201d",
      "Riley, who turns 16 in April, said he understood the ban\u2019s objectives, but there are other ways to achieve them. He suggested a 10 p.m. enforced social media curfew for young children to prevent them losing sleep.",
      "Riley has an ally in Australia\u2019s largest city, Sydney: schoolboy Noah Jones, who turns 16 in August.",
      "Noah is one of two 15-year-old plaintiffs in a constitutional challenge to the law in the High Court. The other in the case brought by the Sydney-based rights group Digital Freedom Project is schoolgirl Macy Neyland.",
      "They claim the law improperly robs 2.6 million young Australians of a right to freedom of political communication implied in Australia\u2019s constitution.",

      "Following a policy meeting chaired by Prime Minister Kim Min-seok on Wednesday, officials said they will ramp up screening and removal of problematic AI-generated ads and impose punitive fines, citing growing risks to consumers \u2014 especially older people who struggle to tell whether content is AI-made.",

      "\u201cAnyone who creates, edits, and posts AI-generated photos or videos will be required to label them as AI-made, and the users of the platform will be prohibited from removing or tampering with those labels,\u201d he said.",
      "AI-generated ads using digitally fabricated experts or deepfake videos and audios of celebrities, promoting everything from weight-loss pills and cosmetics to illegal gambling sites, have become staples across the South Korean spaces of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms.",
      "The government will seek to revise the telecommunications act and other related laws so the AI-labeling requirement, along with strengthened monitoring and punitive measures, can take effect in early 2026. Companies operating the platforms will also be responsible for ensuring that advertisers comply with the labeling rules, Lee said.",
      "Officials say it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to monitor and detect the growing number of false ads fueled by AI. South Korea\u2019s Food and Drug Safety Ministry identified more than 96,700 illegal online ads of food and pharmaceutical products in 2024 and 68,950 through September this year, up from around 59,000 in 2023.",

      "Government plans include more research and development spending on AI-specific chips and other advanced semiconductor products as well as expanding the country\u2019s chip manufacturing hubs beyond metropolitan areas near the capital city of Seoul to the southern regions. South Korean chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, combined for more than 65% of the global memory chip market last year.",

    "story": [
      "Japan has issued a megaquake advisory after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture on the main island",
      "TOKYO -- Japan issued a megaquake advisory Tuesday after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main island of Honshu, and just south of the northern island of Hokkaido. Damage from this quake was modest \u2014 34 mostly mild injuries and some damage to roads and buildings.",
      "Officials said the advisory is not a prediction and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake is only about 1%. But there\u2019s hope the advisory will serve as a wake-up call for a quake that could have the devastation of the 2011 disaster that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed a nuclear plant.",
      "There's said to be an increased risk of a subsequent, magnitude-8 or larger quake within the next week. Officials are urging residents, especially along coastal areas, to be well prepared so they can grab an emergency bag and run as soon as possible if a bigger quake hits.",
      "This advisory seemed mindful compared with another advisory last year. The southern half of Japan's Pacific coastline received a \u201cNankai Trough\u201d megaquake advisory in the summer of 2024, but the ambiguity of that warning led to panic buying of emergency food, event cancellations and business closures.",
      "The Japan Meteorological Agency says Monday's powerful quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches \u2014 the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench \u2014 that have caused many large quakes in the past.",
      "Experts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.",
      "In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.",
      "The 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 15 meters (50 feet) in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.",
      "Another offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 30-meter (98-foot) tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.",
      "The areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba prefecture.",
      "Japan's separate advisory for an even more damaging megaquake stemming from the Nankai Trough, which affects the southern half of Japan's Pacific coast, was activated for the first time last August after a magnitude 7.1 quake occurred off the eastern coast of Miyazaki.",

      "Archaeologists in Britain say they have found the earliest known evidence of deliberate fire-making, dating to around 400,000 years ago",
      "LONDON -- Scientists in Britain say ancient humans may have learned to make fire far earlier than previously believed, after uncovering evidence that deliberate fire-setting took place in what is now eastern England around 400,000 years ago.",
      "The findings, described in the journal Nature, push back the earliest known date for controlled fire-making by roughly 350,000 years. Until now, the oldest confirmed evidence had come from Neanderthal sites in what is now northern France dating to about 50,000 years ago.",
      "The discovery was made at Barnham, a Paleolithic site in Suffolk that has been excavated for decades. A team led by the British Museum identified a patch of baked clay, flint hand axes fractured by intense heat and two fragments of iron pyrite, a mineral that produces sparks when struck against flint.",
      "Researchers spent four years analyzing to rule out natural wildfires. Geochemical tests showed temperatures had exceeded 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 Fahrenheit), with evidence of repeated burning in the same location.",
      "That pattern, they say, is consistent with a constructed hearth rather than a lightning strike.",
      "Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said the combination of high temperatures, controlled burning and pyrite fragments shows \u201chow they were actually making the fire and the fact they were making it.\u201d",
      "Iron pyrite does not occur naturally at Barnham. Its presence suggests the people who lived there deliberately collected it because they understood its properties and could use it to ignite tinder.",
      "Deliberate fire-making is rarely preserved in the archaeological record. Ash is easily dispersed, charcoal decays and heat-altered sediments can be eroded.",
      "At Barnham, however, the burned deposits were sealed within ancient pond sediments, allowing scientists to reconstruct how early people used the site.",

      "Chris Stringer, a human evolution specialist at the Natural History Museum, said fossils from Britain and Spain suggest the inhabitants of Barnham were early Neanderthals whose cranial features and DNA point to growing cognitive and technological sophistication.",
      "Fire also enabled new forms of social life. Evening gatherings around a hearth would have provided time for planning, storytelling and strengthening group relationships, which are behaviors often associated with the development of language and more organized societies.",
      "Archaeologists say the Barnham site fits a wider pattern across Britain and continental Europe between 500,000 and 400,000 years ago, when brain size in early humans began to approach modern levels and when evidence for increasingly complex behavior becomes more visible.",
      "Nick Ashton, curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, described it as \u201cthe most exciting discovery of my long 40-year career.\"",
      "For archaeologists, the find helps address a long-standing question: When humans stopped relying on lightning strikes and wildfires and instead learned to create flame wherever and whenever they needed it.",

      "Many children posted farewell messages, while parents reported distraught children discovering they\u2019d been shut out of platforms as the landmark law took effect. Some young children reported fooling the platforms' age estimation technology by drawing on facial hair. Parents and older siblings are also expected to help some children circumvent the restrictions.",
      "\u201cThis is the day when Australian families are taking back power from these big tech companies and they\u2019re asserting the right of kids to be kids and for parents to have greater peace of mind,\u201d Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThis reform will change lives. For Australian kids ... allowing them to just have their childhood. For Australian parents, enabling them to have greater peace of mind. But also for the global community, who are looking at Australia and saying: well, if Australia can do it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d Albanese later told a gathering of reform supporters at his official Sydney residence, including parents who blame social media for a child\u2019s suicide.",
      "Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32.9 million) from Wednesday if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16.",
      "The ban will be enforced by Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant. She said the platforms already had the technology and personal data about their users to enforce the age restriction with precision.",

She said more than 200,000 TikTok accounts in Australia had already been deactivated by Wednesday.",
      "Wells also warned young children who had so far evaded detection that they would eventually be caught. A child who used a virtual private network to appear to be in Norway would be caught out if they were routinely posting images of Australian beaches, Wells said.",
      "\u201cJust because they might have avoided it (detection) today doesn\u2019t mean they will be able to avoid it in a week\u2019s time or a month\u2019s time because social media platforms have to go back and routinely check under-16 accounts,\u201d Wells said.",

      "Aaron said he launched the app in April as a way to help immigrant communities protect themselves from surprise raids or potential harassment. Immigrant advocates had mixed feelings about the app's usefulness, but civil liberties experts said efforts to remove it resembled what authoritarian governments have done outside the U.S., such as when Chinese pressure in 2019 led Apple to remove an app that enabled Hong Kong protesters to track police.",

      "TORO TORO, Bolivia -- Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters \u2014 capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California\u2019s Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\u201d said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \u201cWe have all these world records at this particular site.\u201d",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\u201cThe preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\u201d said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\u201cThis is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\u201d Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn\u2019t think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia\u2019s Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks \u2014 and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer \u2014 suggest that dinosaurs didn\u2019t settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",

    "story": [
      "An immigration crackdown in Louisiana has forced some teenagers to grow up fast after their parents were arrested by federal agents",
      "KENNER, La. -- Vilma Cruz, a mother of two, had just arrived at her newly leased Louisiana home this week when federal agents surrounded her vehicle in the driveway. She had just enough time to call her oldest son before they smashed the passenger window and detained her.",
      "The 38-year-old Honduran house painter was swept up in an immigration crackdown that has largely targeted Kenner, a Hispanic enclave just outside New Orleans, where some parents at risk of deportation had rushed to arrange emergency custody plans for their children in case they were arrested.",
      "Federal agents have made more than 250 arrests this month across southeast Louisiana, according to the Department of Homeland Security, the latest in a series of enforcement operations that have also unfolded in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. In some homes, the arrests have taken away parents who were caretakers and breadwinners, leaving some teenagers to grow up fast and fill in at home for absent mothers and fathers.",
      "Cruz's detention forced her son, Jonathan Escalante, an 18-year-old U.S. citizen who recently finished high school, to care for his 9-year-old sister, who has a physical disability. Escalante is now trying to access his mother's bank account, locate his sister's medical records and doctors, and figure out how to pay bills in his mother's name.",
      "\u201cHonestly I\u2019m not ready, having to take care of all of these responsibilities,\u201d Escalante told The Associated Press. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to take them on if I have to. And I\u2019m just praying that I get my mom back.\u201d",
      "The crackdown dubbed \u201cCatahoula Crunch\u201d has a goal of 5,000 arrests. DHS has said it is targeting violent offenders but has released few details on who it is arresting. Records reviewed by AP found that the majority of those detained in the first two days of the effort had no criminal histories.",
      "This week, Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican, became the first state official to break with his party over the operations. He criticized them for undermining the regional economy by triggering labor shortages because even immigrants with valid work permits have stayed home out of fear.",
      "\"So I think there needs to be some clarity of what\u2019s the plan,\u201d Nungesser said. \u201cAre they going to take every person, regardless if they got kids, and they\u2019re going to leave the kids behind?\u201d",
      "DHS said Cruz locked herself in the car and refused to lower the window and exit the vehicle as ordered, which forced agents to break the window to unlock the door. She is being held in federal custody pending removal proceedings, officials said.",
      "Immigrant rights groups say the operation is applying a dragnet approach to racially profile Hispanic communities.",
      "In the weeks before the crackdown began, dozens of families without legal status sought to make emergency custody arrangements with relatives, aided by pro bono legal professionals at events organized by advocacy groups in Kenner and throughout the New Orleans region.",
      "\u201cChildren are going to school unsure whether their parents will be home at the end of the day,\" Raiza Pitre, a member of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Louisiana, told a city council meeting Wednesday in Jefferson Parish, which includes Kenner.",
      "Juan Proa\u00f1o, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said he receives dozens of calls daily from Louisiana families worried about being separated from their children. His organization is helping Escalante navigate life without his mother, and he wants to prepare her son for the worst.",
      "\u201cHe thinks she\u2019ll be home in a couple of days, but it could be weeks or months, or she could be deported,\u201d Proa\u00f1o said.",
      "Cruz's family was supposed to move into their new home next month. She leased it so that her son could finally sleep in his own room.",
      "Kenner resident Kristi Rogers watched masked agents detain Cruz, a soon-to-be neighbor whom she had not yet met. Rogers said her heart went out to Cruz, and she wondered why she was targeted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for them trying to clean up the criminals in our area, but I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s all they are detaining and deporting \u2014 the criminals,\u201d Rogers said.",

He said residents were also at risk from immigrant drivers who are unlicensed and uninsured.",

      "Unmarked vehicles began following Reyes and pulled up alongside his car as he parked in front of his house in Kenner. A video reviewed by AP showed several agents leaping out and removing Reyes from his car as his sobbing daughters screamed for mercy.",
      "\u201cWe were begging that they let him go,\" said his eldest daughter, 19-year-old Heylin Leonor Reyes. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who provides for food, pays bills, pays the rent. We were begging them because they\u2019re leaving a family totally in the dark, trying to figure out what to do, figuring out where to get money to get by.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration may have softened its language on China to maintain a truce in their trade war, but Congress is pushing for more restrictions on Beijing",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration may have softened its language on China to maintain a fragile truce in their trade war, but Congress is charging ahead with more restrictions in a defense authorization bill that would deny Beijing investments in highly sensitive sectors and reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese biotechnology companies.",
      "Included in the 3,000-page bill approved Wednesday by the House is a provision to scrutinize American investments in China that could help develop technologies to boost Chinese military power. The bill, which next heads to the Senate, also would prohibit government money to be used for equipment and services from blacklisted Chinese biotechnology companies.",
      "In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act would boost U.S. support for the self-governing island of Taiwan that Beijing claims as its own and says it will take by force if necessary.",
      "\u201cTaken together, these measures reflect a serious, strategic approach to countering the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. He said the approach \u201cstands in stark contrast to the White House's recent actions.\u201d",
      "The compromise bill authorizing $900 billion for military programs was released two days after the White House unveiled its national security strategy. The Trump administration dropped Biden-era language that cast China as a strategic threat and said the U.S. \u201cwill rebalance America\u2019s economic relationship with China,\u201d an indication that President Donald Trump is more interested in a mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing than in long-term competition.",
      "The White House this week also allowed Nvidia to sell an advanced type of computer chip to China, with those more hawkish toward Beijing concerned that would help boost the country's artificial intelligence.",
      "The China-related provisions in the traditionally bipartisan defense bill \u201cmake clear that, whatever the White House tone, Capitol Hill is locking in a hard-edged, long-term competition with Beijing,\u201d said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "If passed, these provisions would \u201cbuild a floor under U.S. competitiveness policy \u2014 on capital, biotech, and critical tech \u2014 that will be very hard for future presidents to unwind quietly,\u201d he said.",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington on Wednesday denounced the bill.",
      "\u201cThe bill has kept playing up the \u2018China threat\u2019 narrative, trumpeting for military support to Taiwan, abusing state power to go after Chinese economic development, limiting trade, economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S., undermining China\u2019s sovereignty, security and development interests and disrupting efforts of the two sides in stabilizing bilateral relations,\u201d said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesperson.",

      "Congress last year failed to pass the BIOSECURE Act, which cited national security in preventing federal money from benefiting a number of Chinese biotechnology companies.

      "The provision in the NDAA no longer names companies but leaves it to the Office of Management and Budget to compile a list of \u201cbiotechnology companies of concern.\u201d The bill also would expand Pentagon investments in biotechnology.",

      "Oracle was one of the heaviest weights on the market and sank 14.5% even though it reported a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its 14% growth in revenue came up just short of expectations.",
      "Doubts also remain about whether all the spending that Oracle is doing on AI technology will produce the payoff of increased profits and productivity that proponents are promising. Analysts said they were surprised by how much Oracle may spend on AI investments this fiscal year, and questions continue about how the company will pay for it.",
      "Such doubts are weighing on the AI industry broadly, even as many billions of dollars continue to flow in. They had helped drag the broad U.S. stock market through some sharp and scary swings last month.",
      "Nvidia, the chip company that\u2019s become the poster child of the AI boom and is raking in close to $20 billion each month, fell 2.8% Thursday. It was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500.",

      "It has been months since Noem last appeared in Congress in May. Since then, immigration enforcement operations, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago, have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department's tactics.",
      "Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss \u201cWorldwide Threats to the Homeland,\u201d which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. With Noem having made only a few appearances before Congress when she is leading Trump's signature policy area, Thursday's appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.",
      "Trump returned to power in January with what he says is a mandate to reshape immigration in the U.S., claiming the country is under an invasion.",
      "In the months since, the number of people in immigration detention has skyrocketed; the administration has continued to remove migrants to countries they are not from; and, in the wake of an Afghan national being accused of shooting two National Guard troops, Noem\u2019s department has dramatically stepped up checks and screening of immigrants in the U.S.",
      "The worldwide threats hearing, usually held annually, is an opportunity for members of Congress to ask the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center about threats facing the U.S. and what their agencies are doing to address them.",
      "Noem's department is under particular scrutiny because Congress in July passed legislation giving it roughly $165 billion to carry out its mass deportations agenda and secure the border. The department is getting more money to hire 10,000 more deportation officers, complete the wall between the U.S. and Mexico and increase detention and removal of foreigners from the country.",

      "The secretary's appearance also comes as a federal judge is investigating whether she should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador.",
      "Noem will also likely have to answer to criticism from Democrats who accuse immigration enforcement agents of erroneously detaining and arresting American citizens in their rush to deport as many people in the country illegally as possible. Homeland Security says agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations do not target or arrest American citizens for immigration reasons although they say they have arrested Americans for allegedly interfering in enforcement operations.",
      "And a number of the Democratic members of the committee are part of a lawsuit accusing Noem and the department of limiting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.",
      "Also attending Thursday\u2019s hearing are Joseph Kent, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and Michael Glasheen, operations director of the national security branch of the FBI.",
      "Previous hearings have included questions on cybersecurity, China, chemical security and drones. Under President Joe Biden, at times of heavy migration at the southern border, Republicans often focused their questioning on his Democratic administration's handling of border security.",
      "When the hearing was announced in September, the Republican committee chair said that besides Noem and Kent, FBI Director Kash Patel would also be attending. But instead the FBI is being represented by Glasheen.",

      "Closing arguments are expected Friday in the murder trial of Brian Walshe in connection with the disappearance of his wife Ana",
      "BOSTON -- On the same day his wife was last seen alive, Brian Walshe went to multiple Massachusetts pharmacies and hardware stores to buy heavy-duty cleaning supplies, a Tyvek protective suit and a utility knife, according to prosecutors.",
      "He made the trips after early-morning internet searches including, \u201cHow long before a body starts to smell?\u201d and \u201cDismemberment and best ways to dispose of a body.\u201d Over the next several days, he continued searching for how to dismember a body with a hacksaw, not reporting her missing until Jan. 4, when her employer began looking for her and contacted police.",
      "Closing arguments are expected Friday in Walshe's trial on a charge of first-degree murder. He previously pleaded guilty to misleading police and improper disposal of a body, on the day jury selection was set to begin.",
      "His attorneys rested Thursday without calling any witnesses, despite speculation that Walshe might testify. His attorneys have tried to cast reasonable doubt, acknowledging he lied to investigators while arguing he panicked after discovering Ana dead following a New Year\u2019s Eve gathering. With no body ever recovered, investigators have been unable to determine a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWhen he entered the bedroom and began to get into bed, he sensed something was wrong,\u201d defense attorney Larry Tipton told jurors during the trial\u2019s first week, describing a moment when Ana did not respond and \u201crolled off the bed.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors, meanwhile, have pointed to Walshe\u2019s actions afterward as evidence of premeditation. Jurors were shown surveillance footage of him at stores like CVS, Walgreens and Lowe\u2019s and purchasing items including hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. Jurors also were shown photos of tools that investigators testified tested positive for blood, including a hacksaw and a hatchet.",

      "Prosecutors also connected him to items found at a trash processing facility near his mother\u2019s home, including a hatchet, hacksaw, towels, a Tyvek suit, cleaning agents, a Prada purse, boots like those Ana was last seen wearing and her COVID-19 vaccination card. Investigators testified Ana had also taken out a $2.7 million life-insurance policy naming him as beneficiary.",
      "Friends described Ana\u2019s final weeks as emotionally strained. Gem Mutlu, who spent New Year\u2019s Eve with the couple, said they appeared \u201cvery much in love,\u201d though he later learned Ana and another man had exchanged messages that night.",
      "Another friend, Alissa Kirby, told jurors Ana seemed exhausted by travel and stressed about her marriage. The two had recently grown close, walking together and going to karaoke; Kirby teared up when shown photos of them. She testified that Ana considered moving her family to Washington and said Brian often questioned whether she loved him.",
      "Kirby also recounted two messages from Brian shortly before Ana was reported missing \u2014 one on Christmas, when he asked if she knew where Ana was, and another on Jan. 3: \u201cI know we did this a week ago but have you heard from Ana?\u201d",

      "The family of a Chicago police officer who was fatally shot by her partner while on duty has filed a lawsuit contending the Chicago Police Department did not heed warnings about the officer who fired the shot",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Chicago Police Department knew that Officer Carlos Baker was reckless and posed a threat to his partner, Krystal Rivera, before Baker fatally shot her last summer while the pair attempted to apprehend a suspect with a gun, a lawsuit filed Thursday claims.",
      "Rivera, 36, had told supervisors she feared for her safety with Baker as her partner and had ended a two-year on-again, off-again romantic relationship with him shortly before the shooting on June 5, according to the lawsuit. Additionally, the department knew of Baker's history of complaints, including one filed by a woman once romantically involved with Baker who said he had threatened her with a gun in a bar, it added.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in Cook County Circuit Court by Rivera's mother, Yolanda Rivera. It names Baker and the city of Chicago as defendants and seeks compensatory and punitive damages of more than $50,000 for most of its nine counts. It contends Baker shot Rivera in the back and failed to notify anyone of the shooting or render even rudimentary first aid to her.",
      "\u201cKrystal understood the dangers of this job. She accepted the risk that came with policing. What she never should have had to fear was her own partner,\u201d Yolanda Rivera said at a news conference. \u201cThat betrayal cost Krystal\u2019s life.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department, which was not named as a defendant, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Baker does not have a listed phone number and it is unknown if he has an attorney. An email message seeking comment from the city was not immediately returned.",
      "Rivera and Baker, both members of a police tactical unit, had conducted a traffic stop on a motorist suspected of having a gun. A foot chase ensued and ended outside an apartment. According to the lawsuit, Baker was positioned in front of the door and Rivera to the side or behind him. Baker kicked in the door to reveal the suspect with a gun.",
      "Baker fired his weapon but struck Rivera in the back, Rivera family attorney Antonio Romanucci said, but instead of reporting that an officer had been hit, he fled to another floor of the apartment building.",
      "\u201cHe did not attempt even the most basic first aid step of applying pressure on her wound to mitigate blood loss, or try any other lifesaving measures,\u201d Romanucci said. \u201cBaker left Krystal there on the floor, literally gasping. Krystal radioed in her own shooting.\u201d",
      "The police department, he said, filed reports with state regulators claiming the shots had come from a suspect who had been barricaded.",

      "Romanucci said Baker had accumulated 11 misconduct complaints in three years, a record worse than 95% of Chicago police officers. In December 2022, he threatened an ex-girlfriend in a tavern by brandishing a weapon, a charge Romanucci said was investigated by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability with no conclusion. That office declined comment.",
      "Rivera was hired as a Chicago police officer in February 2021 and was partnered with Baker in January 2023. The two began a romantic relationship in June of that year, but she requested a different partner citing Baker's \u201cprior reckless conduct,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "The change was granted but after Rivera was promoted to a tactical unit, she learned in early 2024 that Baker would again be her partner. Baker was removed as a tactical officer in April 2024 because his lack of years of service made him ineligible. However, he was reassigned as Rivera's tactical-team partner in March 2025.",
      "Rivera learned last winter that Baker had a live-in girlfriend, ended her relationship with Baker for good, and repeatedly told Baker she intended to tell the other woman about their relationship, the lawsuit says. She told colleagues she had concerns about Baker's \u201cnegative and hostile reaction\" to the breakup. The complaint says that Baker continued to ask her to see him outside of work and showed up at her home early on June 4 against Rivera's wishes.",
      "\u201cHe never should have gotten past his probationary period. He was not fit to police our communities, let alone carry a gun under the color of law,\u201d Romanucci said. \u201cThe decision CPD made to keep Carlos Baker on the force was not costly. It was fatal.\u201d",

He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.",

      "Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump\u2019s Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked a federal judge there to dismiss them.",
      "The 2019 settlement found he had a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of danger in El Salvador if he was deported there. So instead ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. Abrego Garcia has sued, claiming the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish him for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.",

      "ICE freed Abrego Garcia from Moshannon Valley Processing Center, about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh, on Thursday just before the deadline Xinis gave the government to provide an update on Abrego Garcia's release.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Defense attorneys and prosecutors were set Thursday to choose the jurors who will decide whether a Wisconsin judge accused of helping a Mexican immigrant dodge federal officers committed a crime.",
      "Federal prosecutors charged Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan this spring with obstruction and concealing an individual to prevent arrest. They allege she showed 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz out of her courtroom through a back door when she learned federal authorities were in the courthouse looking to arrest him.",

      "Here's what to know about the case, jury selection and the trial:",
      "According to an FBI affidavit, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the United States from Mexico in 2013. Agents learned that he had been charged in state court with battery in March and was scheduled to appear in front of Dugan on April 18.",
      "Agents traveled to the courthouse to arrest Flores-Ruiz after the hearing. A public defender noticed the agents in the corridor and told Dugan\u2019s clerk about them. Dugan grew angry, according to the affidavit, declared the situation \u201cabsurd\u201d and approached with another judge. Dugan argued with the agents over whether their warrant was valid and told them to speak to the chief judge.",
      "Dugan returned to her courtroom, told Flores-Ruiz to come with her and led him and his attorney out a back jury door to the public corridor outside the courtroom, the affidavit says. Agents on their way back from the chief judge\u2019s office spotted Flores-Ruiz, but he made it outside. He was eventually captured after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November that he had been deported.",
      "Democrats insist President Donald Trump's administration is trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to its immigration crackdown.",
      "The administration, for its part, has been vilifying Dugan on social media. FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo of her being led out of the courthouse in handcuffs and the Department of Homeland Security posted that Dugan has taken the term activist judge \"to a whole new meaning.\u201d",
      "Dugan told police she found a threatening flyer from an anti-government group at her home and at her mother and sister's homes four days after Flores-Ruiz was captured.",
      "Dugan's attorneys have said they're worried publicity about the case has tainted the jury pool. They sent a questionnaire to prospective jurors this fall in an effort to gauge their political involvement and leanings, asking whether they belong to political organizations, what radio shows and podcasts they follow, and what stickers, signs and patches they have on their cars, water bottles, backpacks and laptops.",
      "Attorneys on both sides have already agreed to strike 44 prospective jurors, online court records show. A group of 40 prospective jurors was scheduled to show up Thursday morning at the federal courthouse in Milwaukee and fill out yet another questionnaire about whether their views have changed since they completed the first survey. Attorneys plan to spend the day questioning them in person.",

According to her arguments, Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley sent out a draft policy on immigration arrests in the courthouse about a week before Flores-Ruiz was arrested. The policy barred agents from executing administrative warrants in nonpublic courthouse areas and required court personnel to immediately refer any immigration agents to a supervisor, which Dugan did.",
      "Dugan further contends that Ashley denied the agents permission to arrest Flores-Ruiz in the courtroom or the hallway. The agents then abandoned their plan to arrest him in the building and instead followed him outside so they could arrest him on the street, according to Dugan.",

      "Nichols confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted that he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.",
      "In a recent interview, Pulley's sister, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols' execution has been \u201c37 years of hell.\u201d She described her sister as \u201cgentle, sweet and innocent,\u201d and said she hopes that after the execution she'll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.",
      "Nichols' attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated \u201che would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.\u201d",
      "Nichols, 64, has seen two previous execution dates come and go. The state earlier planned to execute him in August 2020, but Nichols was given a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, Nichols had selected to die in the electric chair \u2014 a choice allowed in Tennessee for inmates who were convicted of crimes before January 1999.",
      "Tennessee\u2019s lethal injection protocol in 2020 used three different drugs in series, a process that inmates\u2019 attorneys claimed was riddled with problems. Their concerns were shown to have merit in 2022, when Gov. Bill Lee paused executions, including a second execution date for Nichols.

      "CHICAGO -- A federal appeals court blocked the immediate release of hundreds of immigrants detained during a Chicago area immigration crackdown in a split decision Thursday that also allowed the extension of a consent decree outlining how federal immigration agents can make warrantless arrests.",
      "The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments last week about the 2022 agreement governing how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can arrest immigrants besides those being specifically targeted in an operation. The consent decree has been in the spotlight amid the Trump administration's Chicago-area immigration crackdown that's led to more than 4,000 arrests.",
      "Last month, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who found the government violated the agreement, ordered the release of more than 600 immigrants on bond, which the appeals court paused. Roughly 450 remain in custody, attorneys say.",
      "In the 2-1 opinion, the appeals court said Cummings overstepped his authority on the blanket release of the detainees without assessing each case individually. The consent decree \u201ccarefully maps out what the district judge can or cannot order\u201d to balance enforcement and public safety, according to the opinion. But the ruling also said the Trump administration wrongly categorized all immigrant arrestees as subject to mandatory detention.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorneys said they were disheartened by the ruling but glad the court upheld the extension of the agreement, which among other things requires ICE to show documentation for each arrest it makes. Federal judges elsewhere including in Colorado have also ruled to limit warrantless arrests.",
      "Attorneys pushed for a quick decision, saying many are being deported without knowing their options. The hundreds of detainees, mostly from the Chicago area, were arrested from summer through the early weeks of the \u201cOperation Midway Blitz\u201d immigration crackdown in the fall.

      "Nativity scenes at some churches are sparking fierce debates",
      "DEDHAM, Mass. -- One baby Jesus lays in a manger in the snow, wrapped in a silver emergency blanket with his wrists zip-tied. Mary stands nearby outside the Lake Street Church in Evanston, Illinois, wearing a plastic gas mask and flanked by Roman soldiers in tactical vests labeled \u201cICE.\u201d",
      "In another Chicago suburb, not far from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has drawn protests over detentions, a sign at the manger outside the Urban Village Church says \u201cDue to ICE activity in our community the Holy Family is in hiding.\u201d And more than a thousand miles away, the Christ child went missing from a nativity scene at St. Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced by a hand-painted sign: \u201cICE was here.\u201d",
      "These and other stark reimaginings of Christ's birth are drawing praise and outrage as churches turn the Christmas tableau into a commentary on federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. Their creators say they are placing the ancient story in a contemporary frame, portraying the Holy Family as refugees to reflect on the fear of separation and deportation that many families \u2014 including their own parishioners \u2014 are experiencing today.",
      "Supporters of the displays say the Bible is on their side, but critics call the scenes sacrilegious and politically divisive, accusing the churches of abusing sacred imagery and some arguing they should lose their tax-exempt status. The archdiocese in Massachusetts ordered that the manger must be \u201crestored to its proper sacred purpose.\u201d",
      "The debate comes as immigration enforcement intensifies in states and cities whose leaders object to the immigration crackdown. In September alone, a combined total of at least 2,000 people were arrested in Illinois and Massachusetts, according to federal arrest figures released by immigration authorities.",
      "For churches, Christmas is a time \u201cwhen we have public art out on the lawn and we get an opportunity to say something,\u201d said Rev. Michael Woolf, senior minister at Lake Street. Another nativity scene created by the Baptist congregation one recent year showed Jesus in rubble \u2014 a \u201cplea for peace\u201d in Gaza, he said.",
      "St. Susanna parishioners locked baby Jesus in a cage in 2018 to protest how President Donald Trump's first administration was separating families at the border. Another year, they depicted the infant floating in water polluted with plastic to highlight climate change.",

      "\u201cThe people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship \u2014 not divisive political messaging,\u201d a diocesan spokesperson said.",
      "Some Catholic activists want the priest punished.",
      "\u201cThis is really a grave scandal for Catholics, and I think he\u2019s playing with fire,\u201d said C.J. Doyle, director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts. \u201cThe archbishop can remove him as pastor, suspend him from active ministry \u2014 he can even close the parish and sell the property right out from under him.\u201d",
      "Josoma said the display's purpose is to move \u201cbeyond static traditional figures and evoke emotion and dialogue\u201d in response to the fear many parishioners face as federal forces arrest more than undocumented immigrants, sweeping up longtime legal residents and spreading anxiety.",

      "ATLANTA -- Lawyers for a man set to be put to death next week in Georgia argue that an agreement entered into by the state and death penalty defense attorneys during the COVID-19 pandemic should shield their client from execution for the time being.",
      "A federal judge is set to hear arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by lawyers for Stacey Humphreys, who is scheduled to die on Dec. 17. Humphreys, 52, was convicted of malice murder in the 2003 killings of 33-year-old Cyndi Williams and 21-year-old Lori Brown at the real estate office where they worked in a suburb of Atlanta.",
      "After Georgia put executions on hold during the pandemic, the state attorney general's office entered into an agreement with lawyers for people on death row to set the terms under which they could resume. The state Supreme Court has affirmed that the agreement is a binding contract.",
      "The text of the agreement says it applies only to people on death row whose requests to have their appeals reheard were denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals while a pandemic-related judicial emergency was in place. The judicial emergency was lifted in June 2021 and the appeals court rejected Humphreys' request in October 2024. Lawyers for the state argue that Humphreys is, therefore, not covered by the agreement and his execution should be allowed to proceed.",
      "The agreement includes three conditions that must be met before executions could be scheduled for the covered prisoners: the expiration of the state\u2019s COVID-19 judicial emergency, the resumption of normal visitation at state prisons and the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cto all members of the public.\u201d",
      "Additionally, state lawyers agreed that once those conditions were met, they would provide three months' notice before pursuing an execution warrant for one of the prisoners covered by the agreement and six months\u2019 notice for the rest.",
      "Although the judicial emergency was lifted more than four years ago, defense attorneys say the other two conditions have not been met because visitation is \u201cseverely restricted\u201d compared with its pre-pandemic levels and infants under 6 months old are not eligible for the vaccine.",

      "Initial phases of the plan establish a conservation easement across about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) of land, owned by a charitable arm of Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), on the outskirts of the village of Abiquiu.",
      "That easement stretches across reservoir waterfront and native grasslands to the doorstep of a remote home owned by O'Keeffe's estate, a few miles from her larger home and studio in Abiquiu.

      "Hayden said the voluntary plan guards against the potential encroachment of modern development that might subdivide and transform the property, though there are not any imminent proposals.",

      "Two initial phases of the conservation plan are part of a broader plan to protect more than 30 square miles (78 square kilometers) of the area through conservation easements and public land transfers, with the support of at least one wildlife foundation. That would extend protections to the banks of the Chama River and preserve additional wildlife habitat.",

      "But instead of putting the money toward the show, Rinsch steered the cash to a personal account where he made a series of failed investments, losing around half of the $11 million in a couple months, according to prosecutors.

      "Then came the lavish purchases, prosecutors said, with Rinsch buying five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, along with $652,000 on watches and clothes. He also bought two mattresses for about $638,000 and spent another $295,000 on luxury bedding and linens. In addition, he used some of the money to pay off about $1.8 million in credit card bills, prosecutors said.",

      "Warner Bros. Discovery \"shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\" he said.",
      "Paramount Skydance is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The new offer steps up the battle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, which on Friday agreed to a deal with Netflix under which the streaming giant would acquire Warner's streaming and movie assets. Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable television channels such as CNN, TBS, TNT and The Food Network. The transaction would also have an easier path through the regulatory process than Netflix's offer, according to Paramount.",
      "\"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",
      "The offer is backed by the Ellison family \u2014 Paramount CEO David Ellison's father is Larry Ellison, who leads software maker Oracle Corp. and is the second-richest person with a net worth of $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2014 as well as investment firm RedBird Capital.",
      "Paramount Skydance's bid also includes several outside financing partners, according to a Paramount Skydance regulatory filing. They include Affinity Partners, the private equity firm run by Jared Kushner, a son-in-law of President Trump, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.",
      "The outside investment firms have agreed to give up any governance rights, including seats on the board of directors of a combined firm, according to the regulatory filing.",
      "Potential antitrust \u2014 and political \u2014 hurdles",
      "Some Wall Street analysts have said the Netflix-Warner Bros. combination could raise concerns among U.S. antitrust enforcers because of the streaming service's size and the potential to reduce competition in the media space.",
      "\"Because Netflix is positioned as the largest streaming platform, the company's acquisition of HBO Max services and customers raises red flags,\" said Jeffrey May, managing editor for the Insights & Enrichment team within Wolters Kluwer Legal and Regulatory U.S., in an email.",
      "May added, \"Netflix and HBO Max compete for subscribers. Their combination could be seen as a threat to competition and innovation.\"",

      "Usha Haley, a Wichita State University professor who specializes in international business strategy, told the Associated Press that Paramount's ties to Mr. Trump are notable. Larry Ellison is an avowed supporter of Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump \"said he's going to be involved in the decision \u2014 we should take him at face value,\" Haley said. \"For him, it's just greater control over the media.\"",
      "Netflix declined to comment, while Warner Bros. Discovery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a presentation at the UBS Global Media and Communications conference on Monday, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said they were confident their deal with Warner Bros. would close. Sarandos also said Netflix is committed to creating U.S. jobs.",
      "Blair Levin, a media and telecommunications industry analyst with investment adviser New Street Research, said Mr. Trump's involvement in the battle for Warner Bros. could backfire for Paramount Skydance.",
      "\"If Trump weighs in publicly against the deal, [Netflix] could argue that he did so for political or personal reasons rather than antitrust reasons and seek evidence, including discovery and depositions, leading to all kinds of delays and other potential collateral damage to the government case,\" he said in a note to investors.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",
      "Paramount Skydance's tender offer is set to expire on Jan. 8, 2026, unless it is extended.",

      "Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming platforms, which include HBO Max and Discovery+, rank as the fourth-largest with 128 million subscribers, followed by Paramount+ at No. 5, with 78 million customers, he added. Amazon Prime Video and Disney/Hulu rank as No. 2 and 3, respectively.",
      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. In a statement on Friday, Warren said the combination would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "Netflix is likely to argue that other video platforms, such as YouTube should be included in calculating streaming services' market share,\u00a0according to The Guardian.",
      "The bidding war follows Warner Bros. Discovery's announcement in June that it planned to split into two businesses, separating its cable networks from its streaming and studios business.",
      "But in October, the media conglomerate said it had attracted interest\u00a0from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast, were pursuing a deal.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The playful, graceful and surprising designs of architect Frank Gehry (Feb. 28, 1929-Dec. 5, 2025) changed the skylines of cities around the world, from Los Angeles, New York and Seattle to Barcelona, Paris, Berlin and Panama City. But he was never completely happy with his work. Asked by \"Sunday Morning\" in 2022 what he saw when he looked at his 2003 Walt Disney Concert Hall \u2014 a Los Angeles landmark whose massive curves fit together like puzzle pieces \u2014 Gehry replied, \"Well, I see what I would do different!\" What sounded like second guessing, Gehry called \"creative insecurity.\"",
      "Born Frank Goldberg in Toronto, Canada, he worked at his grandfather's hardware store, \"playing with the nails and the screws,\" he said. His father brought the family to Los Angeles in 1947, when Frank was 17. \"It just looked like a new world somehow; I was quite moved by it,\" he said.",
      "He fell in love with architecture, and, at the behest of his first wife, who was fearful of antisemitism, changed his last name to Gehry. He began incorporating industrial materials into his designs, but his ideas really took flight once he adapted software created for the aerospace industry. His buildings' flowing curves could now mimic movement.",
      "\"The movement is feeling,\" he said. \"And how do you get a big monster building to have any feeling? And the movement makes that happen. And I think that finding a way to build it was the issue.\" One humorous example: a tower in Prague, inspired by human forms gracefully entangled. The building was nicknamed \"Fred and Ginger.\"",
      "His Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, opened in 1997, was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. Gehry's aerospace software allowed for the precise calculations necessary to shape titanium into a curving exterior. \"When you go there, you see the light play with the building, especially on gray days when you really want some light, you want a feeling of warmth,\" Gehry said. \"All of a sudden, this metal glows beautifully.\"",
      "Among his other recognizable projects: The Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris; the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany; the Peter B. Lewis Building in Cleveland; the Lou Ruvo Center in Las Vegas; the Gehry Tower in Hanover, Germany; the LUMA Arles Tower in Arles, France; the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis; and the Stata Center in Cambridge, Mass.",
      "Gehry's challenge to architects: \"Think of people and how they're going be inspired by your work, and give them something to think about. That's what a painting does. That's what a sculpture does. And architecture is an art. So, why not?\""

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors after presenting the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office on Saturday, hailing the slate of artists as \"legendary in so many ways.\"",
      "\"Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,\" Mr. Trump, the first president to command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box, said to open the show.",
      "This year's recipients were actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they were \"among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.\"",
      "On Saturday, he called the honorees, whom he was deeply involved in choosing, as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "Asked when he arrived how he had found time to prepare, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't really prepare very much.\"",
      "\"If you look at the great hosts, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, those are the greats,\" Mr. Trump said, while disparaging previous host Jimmy Kimmel, whom the president has criticized on multiple occasions, going so far as to urge ABC to remove him as host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"But no, I think you, you want to be just loose and not a lot to prepare for. You know what you have to be? You have to be yourself,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,\" the president said. \"But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself. Johnny Carson, he was himself.\"",
      "Mr. Trump assumed a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Mr. Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",
      "Mr. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. He said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \"at the request of a certain television network.\" He predicted that the broadcast would have its best ratings ever.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors broadcast is\u00a0scheduled to air Dec. 23\u00a0at 8 p.m. ET/CT on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+,",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \"I Will Survive\" and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "Mr. Trump said persistence is a trait all the artists share.",
      "\"Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,\" he said from the stage. \"But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.\"",
      "He said many of the politicians, celebrities and others in the audience shared the trait, too.",
      "\"I know so many of you are persistent,\" Trump said in his opening. \"Many of you are miserable, horrible people. You are persistent. You never give up. Sometimes I wish you'd give up, but you don't.\"",
      "The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honorees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.",
      "Stallone said being honored at the ceremony was like being in the \"eye of a hurricane.\"",
      "\"This is an amazing event,\" he said. \"But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ... but I'm incredibly humbled by it.\"",
      "Crawford also said it was \"humbling, especially at the end of a career.\"",
      "Gaynor said it \"feels like a dream\" to be honored. \"To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.",
      "Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. \"She truly did survive,\" Farris said. \"What an iconic song.\"",
      "Actor Neil McDonough said he's presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. \"But that isn't even the best part,\" McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I've ever met.\"",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Mr. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \"Trump Kennedy Center.\" He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face-to-face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Mr. Trump attended. Mr. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were \"too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Mr. Trump's Hollywood \"special ambassadors\" and has likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.",
      "Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years.",
      "Simmons spoke favorably of Mr. Trump when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Mr. Trump was \"out for himself\" and criticized the president for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.",
      "Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Mr. Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Mr. Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were \"terrorists.\" But after Mr. Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.",
      "\"If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,\" Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:06:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The star of \"Blue Moon\" talks about playing famed songwriter Lorenz Hart, whose successful collaboration with Richard Rodgers ended owing to Hart's heavy drinking; and about his own youthful ambitions.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a hundred years ago, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart helped put the \"great\" in the Great American Songbook, with songs like \"My Funny Valentine,\" \"The Lady Is a Tramp,\" and \"Blue Moon.\"",
      "But by the early 1940s, Hart's heavy drinking made him an unreliable partner. So, Rodgers teamed up with Oscar Hammerstein II, and their first production, the landmark musical \"Oklahoma!\" opened at the St. James Theatre on March 31, 1943.",
      "It was an immediate hit, and that night there was a big party a few doors down at Sardi's, that legendary Broadway watering hole, with its walls hung with the caricatures of famous faces. Lorenz Hart showed up at Sardi's that night, and what happened next is now a movie.",
      "In \"Blue Moon,\" Ethan Hawke is Hart, drowning his sorrows at the bar.",
      "For the film, they re-created Sardi's on a soundstage, but \"Sunday Morning\" met Hawke at the real thing.",
      "\"I was definitely the type of young person that would walk in and think, 'When am I gonna get my painting up there?'\" he said. \"I'm not above that. I'm a little heartbroken that I don't have one up yet!\"",
      "Perhaps his time will come. \"My time's coming,\" he said. \"I have hope. I'm not done yet!\"",
      "And this performance is proof: the real Lorenz Hart was less than five feet tall, so director and frequent Hawke collaborator Richard Linklater used camera tricks to make the nearly six-foot actor look short. Hawke also shaved the top of his head to make a real combover, and he learned a mountain of dialogue.",
      "\"It's definitely the most text I've ever had in a movie,\" Hawke said. \"I remember calling my wife after the first day \u2013 I think I had more lines than I had in the previous five films.\"",
      "It was a challenge for an actor whose face usually says it all. In the 1989 film \"Dead Poets Society,\" Hawke played a student, and he says he learned a lot from co-star Robin Williams. \"There's a scene where he's talking about how to grade poetry, and he has all the kids rip it out \u2013 I didn't realize how much I was being taught, and how that sustained me through negative criticism. It's like, there's not any rules about being a great actor. Drop dead. So you don't like it? Suck an egg. You don't know what great acting is any more than I do.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you're in a movie like that so young, does it set you up? Or does it set you up?\"",
      "\"It's a great question, 'cause it's possibly both,\" he replied. \"If you let it be the high-water mark of your life, it will be, you know, if you put too much on that. You don't want anything at 18 to be the high-water mark of your life.\"",
      "Between movies, Hawke made his Broadway debut with, he says, a lot more confidence than skill. \"That's the weird thing about being young. I had no business being confident at anything. I was a total moron. And I walked in here like I was, you know, John Barrymore.\"",
      "His performance in Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" (1992) was described as \"promising.\" But it was clear that his best work was ahead of him.",
      "Hawke got the first of four Oscar nominations for his role in the 2001 film \"Training Day\" opposite Denzel Washington. His performance still resonates. Hawke said, \"When my son was about six, Levon, he said to me, 'Dad, what's \"Training Day?\"' I said, 'Oh, it's the movie I did a few years ago. Why?' He said, \"'cause every time we walk down the street, when people pass you, they say, \"Training Day\"!'\"",
      "But after \"Training Day,\" there was a time when Hawke says he passed on more parts than he took \u2013 and the offers started drying up. \"When you're young, you think it's everybody. You don't realize that This is a young person's game, and those kinds of job offers, there's a shelf life on that.\"",
      "\"When did your shelf life, when did that hit?\" I asked.",
      "\"Around the same time gray starts appearing in your beard,\" he replied.",
      "The gray in the beard works for him now, as a hard-nosed investigative reporter in the critically-acclaimed FX series \"The Lowdown.\" In the series, you never know what's around the next corner \u2013 just as in real life. As we were wrapping up at Sardi's, owner Max Klimavicius suddenly showed up with a surprise for Hawke: \"Ethan, I would like your permission to make you part of our collection,\" he said.",
      "He was a bit stunned, and to be honest, so were we. But after Ethan Hawke's career on screen and stage, it wasn't all that surprising.",
      "\"Wow!\" he said. \"It finally happened. I've got my portrait at Sardi's. I've arrived! Things are looking up in this life!\"",
      "And now, with his latest film in mind, there's talk of more accolades to come.",
      "How does he handle the Oscar buzz surrounding \"Blue Moon\"? Does he tune it out? He said, \"There's the obvious other part of you that goes, like, 'Hey, I dedicated my life to this job, and this is seen as a barometer.' And I would be dishonest if I didn't say that, like, that would be amazing.",
      "\"This is so corny, but it just flashed through my head: I was like 11 or something, I said to my mother, 'What's gonna happen with my life? What's gonna happen?' And she \u2013 and I remember it so vividly \u2013 in the kitchen, like Doris Day [sings] 'When I was just a little girl\u2026' you know, it goes into 'Que Sera, Sera.'",
      "\"You have to have a little 'Que Sera, Sera.' I don't take any of it for granted. That's, I guess, the right answer. Any little bit of it.\"",

    "summary": "Elvis Presley biographer Peter Guralnick's latest book, \"The Colonel and the King,\" is the story of a partnership that rocked popular culture, and how Colonel Parker's marketing savvy and enduring loyalty helped the King get his crown.",
    "story": [
      "Author Peter Guralnick wrote the definitive two-volume biography of the King: \"Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley\" (1994), and \"Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley\" (2000). And now, his latest is about Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis' legendary manager. Asked if he found anything surprising, Guralnick replied, \"It totally surprised me.\"",
      "\"The Colonel and the King: Tom Parker, Elvis Presley, and the Partnership that Rocked the World\" (Little, Brown & Co.) is the story of a partnership that rocked popular culture, and how Parker's marketing savvy and enduring loyalty helped the King get his crown.",
      "Guralnick says Parker did not create the template for being the manager of a musician: \"It wasn't original to him, it wasn't brand new. But he carried it, I think, to a far greater extent than anyone had before.\"",
      "In 1955, the 20-year-old Presley was playing the Louisiana Hayride when Parker first caught his act. \"It took no more than a few days after seeing him for the first time that he booked Elvis when nobody else was willing to book him,\" Guralnick said.",
      "Parker, who was then handling Hank Snow, quickly put Elvis in the show.",
      "Elvis would sell more than 12 million records in 1956. The Colonel negotiated his recording contract, his movie deal, and oversaw all his marketing.\u00a0 As he would write, \"I don't [just] sit here and smoke cigars hoping for something to happen.\"",
      "Guralnick said, \"There is so much love in some of his early letters to Elvis. And in one he says, you know, 'You are just like me. You are sensitive, you're easily hurt. But only those we love can hurt us.'\"",
      "Presley would write back, \"I love you like a father.\"",
      "Colonel Tom Parker wasn't actually a colonel; he also wasn't American. In fact, Andreas van Kuijk was a stowaway from Holland, who arrived in the U.S. in 1926, barely speaking English. The 16-year-old soon invented an origin story. \"Once he declared himself to be Tom Parker, born in West Virginia, his identity was never questioned for over 50 years,\" said Guralnick. \"The only person who may have known it was Elvis Presley.\"",
      "The honorary title \"Colonel\" would be bestowed on him by Louisiana's Governor. It became his first name. \"That was how he signed all of his letters,\" said Guralnick.",
      "Before Presley, Parker made a star out of Eddy Arnold, booking him as the first \"hillbilly act\" in Vegas.",
      "Actor George Hamilton, who befriended the Colonel in his early days in Hollywood, said, \"He had all the smarts of a con man, but he wasn't. He knew how to make the other person want whatever he was selling.\"",
      "Asked why Parker was so driven, Hamilton replied, \"Emotional stuff from his childhood. I feel like he had some horrible damage done. He didn't like his father.\"",
      "Parker would become notorious for taking a 50% cut of some of Presley's later deals. \"Now, I sat with him one day and I said, 'Is it right to get half of everything?'\" Hamilton recalled. \"And he said, 'Well, you know, 50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.' And I said, 'Well, you mean your half, or his?' He said, 'Well, if I didn't have my half, he wouldn't have his!' And I got it. I got it.\"",
      "The Colonel offered Hamilton an opportunity in Vegas: \"He said, 'And by the way, Elvis has gotta take two weeks off at the Hilton. And I booked you in.' I said, 'I can't do that show. That doesn't make any sense, Colonel.' He said, 'George, you want $50,000 a week?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'It's two weeks. For that, you can do anything, can't you?' I said, 'Yes, sir!'\"",
      "In 1973, after Presley bad-mouthed hotel owner Conrad Hilton on stage in Vegas, Parker confronted him backstage. \"Essentially, Elvis and Colonel fired each other,\" said Guralnick.",
      "The split didn't last long. \"Neither Colonel nor Elvis could imagine a world without the other,\" said Guralnick. \"They simply didn't have the ability to walk away.\"",
      "But Parker began to worry about the \"instability of [his] artist.\"",
      "Asked how he reacted to Presley's increasing drug use, Guralnick replied, \"I think he was at a loss. I think there was an element of denial. But he was well aware of what was going on. Nobody could miss what was going on.\"",
      "In Vegas, Colonel developed his own addiction. George Hamilton saw it firsthand: \"He used to get me to go gambling with him. God! He would go all-in on, like, I mean, big money. I saw close to a million dollars lost at a table.\"",
      "Guralnick said, \"They were caught in a trap \u2013 as Elvis sang! I mean, neither one of them could confront the other one with his problem.\"",
      "According to the author, the two were locked in a relationship of mutual denial \u2013 the twin tragedies of their story. And when Elvis died in 1977, the Colonel, according to Guralnick, \"went into shock.\"",
      "\"I'll never stop trying to keep nis name alive,\" Parker said. He would die in 1997.",
      "While Guralnick was doing research at Elvis' Memphis mansion Graceland, in what was once the office of Elvis' father, Vernon Presley, he was told the office telephone was disconnected: \"So, one night we were working quite late, and it was 10 o'clock at night. And all of a sudden, the phone rang. And so you know, you'll have to tell me: Was this Elvis? Was this Vernon? Maybe it was Colonel.",
      "\"We stared at it. Should we answer? Should we not answer? Who knows what would happen if we answered? But we did not answer. We just listened to it ring, until it finally stopped ringing!\"",
      "\"You wanted the idea that there was one of those three on the other end of the line?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, you want to preserve the mystery!\"",

      "Elvis Presley biographer Peter Guralnick's latest book, \"The Colonel and the King: Tom Parker, Elvis Presley, and the Partnership that Rocked the World\" (Little, Brown & Co.), traces the relationship between the King and a manager whose marketing savvy helped launch a rock 'n' roll revolution.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Anthony Mason's interview with Peter Guralnick on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" December 7!",
      "\"The Colonel and the King\" by Peter Guralnick",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "The Beginning of It All",
      "He first became aware of the boy in early 1955 through an old pal in Texarkana, Arkansas, a DJ, radio personality, and promoter named Ernest Hackworth who went by the name of Uncle Dudley. Hackworth, who, like so many other promoters, worked on his own shows as a country comedian, reported that this kid from Memphis had drawn more than eight hundred people to a little schoolhouse in New Boston, Texas, on January 11, which was a heckuva draw for an unknown artist whose name he usually got all jumbled up.",
      "Oddly enough, Colonel was later reminded, he had actually been told about the boy two months earlier by another old colleague, Oscar Davis, who was wont to say he had made several fortunes (true\u2014he had managed Hank Williams at the height of his career) and lost even more (equally true). Davis, a smooth-tongued, silver-haired operator who went back even further than Colonel in the world of carnivals and show business, was a peer- less pitchman, always immaculately dressed, always sharp as a tack\u2014in the view of a mutual acquaintance who did business with them both, he differed from Colonel in only two ways. Unlike Colonel, Oscar Davis looked the part, \"he looked like the man with the money\"\u2014 but also unlike Colonel (with whom you could operate with complete confidence on a handshake basis) you couldn't trust a word that he said.",
      "Oscar had hit a rough patch lately and was advancing an Eddy Arnold tour for Colonel when he met this Presley boy in Memphis and had even gone to see him perform at some little club where the kid had really gotten the audience worked up. But for one reason or another, it seemed like Oscar wasn't emphasizing the point too strongly, or maybe Colonel just wasn't listening that closely (with Oscar Davis, you didn't want to over-listen), so it wasn't until Uncle Dudley spoke to him the day after the New Boston show that he paid attention.",
      "This time there was no hesitation.",
      "He and Tom Diskin went to see Presley perform at the Louisiana Hayride three days later, and he was so knocked out, not so much by the music\u2014he really wasn't sure at first what to make of the music\u2014as by the reaction of the crowd, that he got in touch with Presley's manager, a Memphis DJ named Bob Neal, right away. Within a week he had him booked on the Hank Snow tour that was about to begin in New Mexico on February 14. Even before the start of the tour, apparently on the strength of the Hayride performance alone, Colonel approached Steve Sholes about signing him to RCA, but as it turned out, the head of Presley's little record label in Memphis, Sam Phillips, wouldn't hear of it, in fact he seemed almost insulted by the idea, so Colonel was forced to let Steve know that it looked like Presley was \"pretty securely tied up\" for the time being.",
      "From the very first dates on the New Mexico tour, the boy's talent\u2014not just his talent but his drive, and especially his capacity for growth\u2014were unmistakable. When asked some eighteen months later if he took credit for Elvis Presley's unparalleled success, the Colonel uncharacteristically demurred. \"I think Presley was a star from the first day he ever started going into show business,\" he said. \"I knew I could help him, [but] I think anyone could have helped him that knows something about show business.\"",
      "It was astounding, the speed with which it happened.",
      "Everywhere the Hank Snow\u2013headlined revue played, the clamor over Presley's performance only grew, and many nights he took the show. Hank Snow tried to hide his reaction, but Colonel could not help but be aware of it and all the ways his client's wounded vanity played out. The boy never seemed to notice, though; he clearly thought the world of Snow, and Colonel did all he could to smooth things over, pointing out that everywhere they went, they were breaking attendance records, which surely had to be considered a tribute to the star of the show.",
      "Things could not have been going better, in fact, for the new partnership between Colonel Tom Parker and Hank Snow. Record sales were up, and due to his assiduous efforts, Colonel never tired of reminding Snow, all sorts of new, high-paying opportunities in radio and television were starting to open up. The trades attributed these rapidly expanding horizons to a unique artist-manager relationship which Cash Box would describe as \"based on loyalty, mutual respect and a common objective,\" not to mention the uncommon efforts of Tom Parker, \"a colorful personality [with] a natural flair for showmanship [who is] known from coast to coast . . . and respected for his sound business principles [and his] policy of doing more than he has promised.\"",
      "But, tellingly, Colonel didn't book Elvis with Hank again until May, while Hank continued to do record-breaking business on his own.",
      "One of the stumbling blocks\u2014the principal stumbling block\u2014to his doing more with Presley was the boy's manager, Bob Neal, who seemed infuriatingly unsusceptible to persuasion, promotion, or even recognition of his own (let alone his artist's) ever-increasing opportunities. During a brief break from touring at the beginning of March, Colonel wrote to Tom Diskin, clearly disheartened by his inability to make any headway with Neal. \"I don't see much use in wasting any [more] money or time on Presley till we know that they need us, and only when they contact us direct for help in some way.\" Things were slow in the business in general, he noted, but he had not given up on improving Hank's royalty situation with RCA, or maybe even moving him to his old friend Randy Wood's Dot label (though in all likelihood, here he was merely musing out loud, for his own and Tom Diskin's benefit, about something that would almost certainly have been little more than a negotiating ploy). Meanwhile, he thought he would set up another strong ten- or fifteen-day tour for Hank, \"keep getting special deals lined up,\" and focus on getting him another guest shot on TV with Perry Como.",
      "But as frustrated as he was by the Presley situation, he was not about to give up. Finally, on March 29, he was able to come to some sort of agreement with Bob Neal for a two-week series of one-nighters in Florida with Hank Snow, but he couldn't resist needling Neal while at the same time trying to steer him toward a more realistic appraisal of the situation. Neal had to pay more attention to business, he wrote with unfeigned indignation. He had to get the Colonel a complete supply of photos and records right away. And most important of all, the boy was never going to get anywhere so long as he was on Sun Records. \"I am finding out that in some places they have never heard of Elvis. . . . this I am not saying to knock, as you well know but to drive home the fact how sad it is that this boy does not get the spread he needs on his records.\" And when Neal failed at this task, as at every other, he wrote again\u2014and again.",
      "The Florida tour was a triumph beyond anything that could have been imagined.",
      "On the first date, in Daytona Beach on May 7, Mae Boren Axton, a forty-year-old high school English teacher and sometime songwriter from Jacksonville, who had been doing advance press work in the area for the Colonel for the last year or two, witnessed a kind of crowd reaction she had never seen before. A well-educated woman from a prominent political family in Oklahoma (her nephew David later became governor of the state and a three-term U.S. senator), she had grown up, she said, with \"no idea\" of what hillbilly music was, but she had come to like it from all the promotion work she had done for numerous hillbilly jamborees over the last few years. Now, in her capacity as Colonel's designated press officer, she undertook to conduct an interview with Elvis before the show, one of the first real interviews he had ever done, she imagined, judging from his polite, tongue-tied responses\u2014but then she was almost struck dumb herself by the altogether unexpected explosiveness of his act. At one point she ran across one of her former students while Elvis was still onstage, \"and she was just right into it, didn't know who he was, none of them did. But she was just ahhhh\u2014all of them were, even some of the old ones were doing like that. I looked at the faces\u2014they were loving it. And I said, 'Hey, honey, what is it about this kid?' And she said, 'Awww, Miz Axton, he's just a great big beautiful hunk of forbidden fruit.'\"",
      "In Orlando, four nights later, the crowd called for Elvis to come back when Hank Snow took the stage, and could not be quieted during Snow's performance. The reporter for the local paper, a complete neophyte to this kind of music (it provided \"a poignant contrast to Metropolitan Opera in Atlanta, I must say,\" she acknowledged to her readers), gave a reasonably enthusiastic account of the entire evening, \"but what really stole the show was this 20- year-old sensation, Elvis Presley, a real sex box as far as the teenage girls are concerned. They squealed themselves silly over this fellow in orange coat and sideburns who 'sent' them. . . . Following the program, Elvis was surrounded by girlies asking for autographs. He would give each a long, slow look with drooped eyelids and comply. They ate it up.\" Which evolved in the blink of an eye into a full-scale riot in Jacksonville, when, at the conclusion of his act, Elvis announced, \"Girls, I'll see you all backstage.\"",
      "\"I heard feet like a thundering herd,\" Mae Axton recalled, \"and the next thing I knew I heard this voice from the shower area, and Elvis was on top of one of the showers looking sheepish and scared, and his shirt was shredded and his coat was torn to pieces . . . he was up there with nothing but his pants on and they were trying to pull at them up on the shower.\" The Colonel, said Mae, \"and I don't mean it derogatorily, got dollar marks in his eyes.\"",
      "But I think even Mae would be willing to admit that this was a reductive picture of a man she had come to admire for both his intellect and determination. Because she could tell even then that from Colonel's perspective Elvis Presley was not just another passing fancy to be cashed in on and forgotten, he was, potentially, a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.",
      "Within days Colonel was hard at work trying to set up another Florida tour. Once again, Bob Neal's refusal, or simply inability, to take a businesslike approach was an obstacle, but one which Colonel was confident he could overcome. On May 25 he wrote to Neal in what could be taken as a lesson in coercive persuasion: \"I was most happy to do what I could to help Elvis and you in getting him across in these new markets. . . . I am always glad to work with both of you, I am not one of the type of personalities that tries to cut out a manager, as you well know a good many would do. . . . If ever you wish to tie in with me closely and let me carry the ball I will be happy to sit down with both of you and try to work it out.\" Evidently that must have struck a chord with Neal, who instantly initiated a phone call, which in turn prompted a second letter from Colonel, spelling out terms and conditions and laying out \"the protection I must have to enable [me] to tie these things up and not be fanning the air and spent my money foolish.\"",
      "He felt no need to mention it at the time, but the second Florida tour, scheduled to begin in just two months, would take place without the presence of Hank Snow. Snow instead would be heading up a West Coast tour of his own, his first all-out assault on that market, which would be operating under the direction of Tom Diskin and conclude with a triumphal appearance at the Hollywood Bowl. Colonel made sure that Hank understood that he was not abdicating managerial responsibility, that every aspect of the tour would be plotted out by himself and Mr. Diskin, and that it would, of course, be fully supported by RCA. But in fact Hank couldn't have been more pleased, and if he were to be perfectly honest about it, he would not miss the presence of Presley in the least. And it wasn't as if he were losing anything on the deal. As a partner in Hank Snow Enterprises\u2013Jamboree Attractions, he stood only to gain by the addition of another big moneymaking tour in whose profits he would be a full participant.",
      "In the meantime, while fully engaged in the setup of both tours, Colonel continued to go back and forth with Bob Neal about the smallest, and largest, of matters. He dangled the promise of two weeks in Las Vegas (\"The [club] owner is a good friend of mine\"), which surely he would have had difficulty delivering on, but Neal didn't bite. He continued to hector Neal about his inattention to business (\"I have been waiting to hear from you,\" again, and again, and again), without any tangible results. Finally, he arranged to meet with Neal in person about a whole panoply of issues, including, once again, trying to shop Presley's record contract to a major label, about which he believed they had finally reached agreement, only to hear back from Neal three days later: \"Hold off any further announcements regarding Elvis until I have more time with him.\"",
      "On June 25, Colonel wrote to Tom Diskin in what appears to be barely concealed, barely punctuated frustration. \"Get it in your mind that there is no future in anything but big deals, no small time stuff it takes as much time and no money can be made of it. You have to believe this so strongly that you will let no one get your time and ear on junk deals. Everytime we have become involved in something small [and here it is hard to believe that he is not for the first time wondering if this is how the whole Elvis experience will turn out] we have lost time money and get nowhere.\"",
      "Just how discouraged he must have been feeling is evident in the entirely unaccustomed rush of emotion that he pours into what he writes next to Diskin, with whom he has been working in perfect harmony for three years now without ever once communicating just how much the younger man's contributions have meant to him. \"The future looks very good for you if you want to make it that way,\" he writes, in a passage posing as well-meant advice for a junior partner who needs bucking up, but which could just as easily be taken as a confidence-building message to Colonel himself. \"I will always protect you all I can/and I know you do the same. You are good for me and I know that I do understand you better than any-one could. Your closer to me than any-one ever has been and will be. and I know you understand me.\"",
      "The return to Florida, beginning on July 25 and ending seven days later with a benefit show in Tampa sponsored by the Sertoma Club and Clyde Rinaldi, proved to be even more spectacular than the first tour. The all-star cast was headlined by comedian-actor Andy Griffith, but it was Elvis who took the show every night, astonishing not only the audience but his fellow performers. Once again there was a riot in Jacksonville in the course of which Elvis once again had his clothes torn off, something the Colonel made sure to mention two weeks later in an exhortatory letter to Sam Weisbord, one of William Morris' most senior West Coast agents.",
      "He was enclosing a set of action pictures he had had taken in Tampa, he wrote to Weisbord. (One of them would become the arresting cover of Elvis' first RCA album some eight months later.) He was also enclosing a selection of his records. \"He is presently on a small record label and they have sold this year over 100,000 of this boy's records already, and they have no distribution whatsoever. . . . This artist seems to me to be right in line for motion picture material, television, and a stage career. . . . With the right training and advice and good material the possibilities are unlimited. His exposure on the stage does 75% towards the public accepting this artist. The talents that are hidden in this personality are unlimited.\"",
      "He didn't hesitate to invoke Hank Snow, another well-regarded William Morris client, who \"has done much to expose the talents of ELVIS PRESLEY, as he has taken him more or less under his wing and has been plugging away on all his personals and blowing the bugle about ELVIS PRESLEY.\"",
      "And he summed it all up on a not altogether unexpected note. \"I can only go so far without the help of friends like you towards making the world aware of such great talent. You have forgotten more than I'll ever know about how to bring this out in an artist and I'm asking you for advice to carry on and get the best results out of and for ELVIS PRESLEY and all of us.\"",
      "He copied the letter to Harry Kalcheim, the head of William Morris' New York office, who had been instrumental in helping to broaden Eddy Arnold's appeal with key supper-club and television bookings. And he continued to bombard Steve Sholes at RCA with letters and telegrams, ostensibly under the guise of tipping him off to something that Colonel was good enough not to want him to miss.",
      "This might all be taken as Colonel's usual method of operation, of course\u2014and in many respects it was. But the lack of caution, the abandonment of all of his usual, carefully calibrated reserve, was something new. Certainly he had felt the same kind of full-blown belief in Eddy Arnold and the vast potential of his talent\u2014but he had always proceeded with an element of circumspection, taking each incremental step only after he was confident of the success of the last. With Presley he was making no such allowance for failure. If the boy failed, he was leaving himself nothing to fall back on. Because here it was not just Elvis Presley's musical talent that foretold an almost limitless future (though that may well have been enough in itself), it was his spongelike ability to absorb and reshape everything that he took in and experienced, his seemingly inexhaustible appetite for self-improvement. As Colonel would one day remark in comparing Presley's talent with that of Gene Austin, his first superstar, both were \"individual artists [who] have a feeling inside them for what they are doing which you can't teach anyone.\" And as he was quick to point out with more than just a smidgen of irony, \"I, as a salesman and drummer, know this [better] than the average guy.\"",

      "Pen in hand and his notebook open before him, he was ready to do what he did every November: Get started on his Christmas list.",
      "He had vacated the French desk in the study and adopted the kitchen island as a command center. At the east end of the island, he wrote letters, paid bills, stashed his laptop, and kept a handy trove of books. The west end was reserved for culinary pursuits.",
      "When Cynthia cooked, he often read aloud to her from Mary Oliver, Billy Collins, Wendell Berry, or, out of long affection, George Herbert and Wordsworth. Early on, they agreed that poetry paired well with food prep, fiction worked best after dinner, and nonfiction was for reading alone, silent as a monk.",
      "By seven-thirty a.m., he had prayed with his wife, checked his sugar, had his shot, and polished off his stone-ground oatmeal with raw honey and multigrain toast. This upbeat start on the morning had made him over-confident \u2013 his pen was poised but nothing was happening. The grand expectation of churning through the list was morphing into a muse.",
      "He considered the books spilling out of their allotted space and encroaching on the laptop. Back in the day, which seemed a cool hundred years ago, he'd been a bachelor priest in his slip-covered wingchair, avidly reading through a pile of books. Books were his friends, his family, his mode of travel, his relief from the woes of the vestry.",
      "Somehow, and certainly not by his own effort, he'd gone from a bachelor with blood kin consisting of one lone cousin, Walter, to a family his cousin called 'humongous.' While such a family delivered equally humongous dividends of pleasure, his reading time had taken a hit.",
      "Before Cynthia, he'd been unmoored by the prospect of sharing his time with a wife. How much of his time could a wife possibly need? Now he knew and he did not regret even a minute with his cheerful, artistic, and beautiful wife. He was unmoored no more; but settled in. In a groove, you might say, though definitely not in a rut.",
      "And there was Dooley \u2013 not of his blood, but of his heart. At the age of eleven, Dooley had landed on his doorstep, a thrown-away boy \u2013 barefoot in shredded overalls, with a mouth that a mother of yore would have washed out with soap. Call it a miracle that today his adopted son \u2013 now a successful veterinarian with his own practice \u2013 had a beautiful, artistic wife himself. And two kids that Cynthia and he were over the moon about.",
      "A phenomenal string of events had cast him in roles he'd never dreamed of fulfilling \u2013 father, husband, father-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, great-uncle, grandfather.",
      "There was Jack, a lovable seven-year-old mash-up of cowboy boots and imagination, and Sadie, a going-on-three-year-old who had taken down every defense in her grandpa's arsenal. He'd never given his heart so freely.",
      "With Cynthia, he'd fought giving his heart. There was the inarguable fact that he'd already given it to God \u2013 though only to a certain degree, as he later realized. That had seen him through a decades-long passage until he had a revelation: God's love for his children wasn't just for them to have and to hold, it was to freely, spontaneously give away \u2013 and to gratefully receive from others. Why hadn't he understood this before?",
      "That awakening had opened both his heart and his intellect to a sober realization \u2013 while he'd spent years being afraid to love, he'd been far more terrified of receiving it. He had begun at once to work these truths into daily practice. Not easy. And not overnight. But the process had performed its share of miracles \u2013 had, in fact, at the tender age of sixty-two, gotten him married.",
      "His abandoned French desk, given to him recently by a former parishioner, now displayed an archive of framed family photos. There was Dooley and Lace's Sadie, miraculously born to a mother long pronounced unable to conceive.",
      "A few years ago, he learned he had a half-brother. Out of time and despair, hope and prayer, Henry \u2013 a brother. They both resolved to drop the 'half' business. He and Cynthia had attended Henry's Holly Springs wedding \u2013 an event that gave him a witty and agreeable sister-in-law. He studied the wedding photograph, searching Henry's face for any resemblance to his own. Zero. But they both loved poetry and starched handkerchiefs and letters written in cursive. He had a laugh at the memory of taking Henry by the shoulders, looking him in the eye, and saying, 'Brother, I forgive you for being taller and better-looking.'",
      "To go from a family consisting of a cousin to the present-day slew was a sea change, calling for a new way of dealing with Christmas giving. In years past, he had made a list. Now he must make A List.",
      "Cynthia breezed into the kitchen in a vague cloud of her signature wisteria scent.",
      "'You wear perfume for the grans?'",
      "'Jack says he loves the way his Granny smells \u2013 it makes him sneeze. He also loves making his own picture book. You'll see it soon; it's about bugs. When he turns all that talent loose in the world ... wow! How about your Poetry with Grandpa syllabus?'",
      "'I need one more run through the town library. Poetry for three-year-olds is scarce.' As Lace's mural-painting commissions increased, she needed help with the kids. He and Cynthia were giving a hand when Lily Flower was otherwise employed.",
      "His wife was applying lipstick without the aid of a mirror. It was his job to give a thumbs-up if she hit the mark. She hit the mark while eyeing the kitchen island.",
      "'Could you clean some of the stuff off the counter?' she said. 'It runneth over.'",
      "'I was just thinking that.'",
      "'I'm making pasta for the weekend and ... ' She gestured. ' . . . all those Billy Collins books.'",
      "'But you love Billy Collins.'",
      "'I'm crazy about Billy Collins, but not when I'm making pasta, which takes up gobs of room.'",
      "'Consider it done.'",
      "She gave him a smooch on the cheek. 'Love you, sweetheart.'",
      "'Love you back.'",
      "'Are you off to the hospital?'",
      "'Tomorrow,' he said.",
      "'See you at five, then. Could you pick up a lemon for tonight?'",
      "'Will do. Anything else, give me a shout. Love to the kids. Tell them I'll be out soon.'",
      "'Ooops, I got lipstick on your cheek.'",
      "'Leave it. I'm branded.'",
      "And away she flew, eager for what life had to offer.",
      "He had always started his Christmas list with the nurses. Who could make it without nurses? Not the doctors, not the patients. How many years had he spent plowing up the hill to visit the ever-changing stable of patients, assisted by nurses in his labors of consolation? Even the sour ones had their place in the scheme of things.",
      "And didn't nurses love chocolate? Wasn't that their favorite thing to go home to even if they had a husband who was good-looking and would carry out the garbage? But the rules had shifted when he wasn't looking. He'd been told that what nurses want now is gift certificates. Nurses want to choose their chocolate themselves.",
      "Good for nurses for speaking out and taking charge!",
      "Five gift certificates for chocolate. It felt good just getting that on paper. Unlike his free-ranging wife, he enjoyed the boundaries imposed by a list.",
      "He would save his wife 'til last on the list because she required more than a bit of head-scratching. 'Don't buy me anything,' she said just yesterday. 'I have everything I could possibly want or need. Just write me a love letter. Please, honey.'",
      "He loved it when she called him honey.",
      "He remembered the Year of the Bathrobe \u2013 he had searched for one-hundred-percent cotton with pockets \u2013 she favored pockets \u2013 and matching slippers. Though he was convinced he had a home run, she had seemed ... what? Dismayed wouldn't cover it.",
      "A more recent Christmas gift had its own downside. According to rule, they agreed to give each other one gift only \u2013 no cheating by giving more. It had to be utilitarian, and they had to keep mum so it would be a surprise. She liked surprises.",
      "They had ended up giving each other the same thing \u2013 a smoothie blender. The same make and model. Surprise all around! Hers, however, had been on sale and she had saved thirty bucks. Which meant that he'd be returning the one he bought. All he had to do was hike to the recycle bin in a freezing rain and retrieve the box and dig through the foam peanuts that went berserk all over the place and locate the shipping label and the form that asked why the item was being returned, to which he replied It's a long story, and then rewrap the blasted thing and schlep it to the UPS drop-off.",
      "Looking back, his own biggest want had once been for a world globe, and she had been thrilled to give him one. Years later \u2013 six or seven, maybe \u2013 he was still perfectly satisfied with his globe. Lighted. In a mahogany stand. How could he want more?",
      "'I'd love to give you something you'd really, deeply enjoy,' she said yesterday. 'Something that would make you feel, I don't know, seventeen again?'",
      "'I have her,' he said.",
      "She seemed to like that argument, but still ...",
      "Since they married, he'd written a love letter or two. The one in which he plagiarized a passage from Duff Cooper had been a hit. Cooper had enjoyed a career of writing torrid love letters to his wife, Diana, before dying at sea in '54. But the letter currently under consideration would have to come entirely from his own striving.",
      "Gus was awake and panting at his feet.",
      "The red leash that his hundred-and-ten-pound Bouvier had worn was of course too large for a rescue of thirty-three pounds soaking wet. He had punched a few holes and used his leather cutter to nip the excess.",
      "Out they went into the mountain fog.",
      "So far, November was an unseasonably warm month, not cold enough for a fire in the hearth. This weekend would be different; the temperature was predicted to drop by several degrees, and they had a half-cord of hardwood he was itching to burn.",
      "This was ground fog; those headed down the mountain would be driving the first few miles in a cloud. He was a fog fan. And no wonder \u2013 he was Irish. Gus also had a touch of the Irish. His dog was fond of music, had once lapped up a spilled Guinness at a Meadowgate party, and was inclined to good humor often resulting in a grin.",
      "He had believed grinning dogs merely a staple of YouTube, but now he had one of his own \u2013 who, by the way, could also bark with a ball in his mouth. He absolutely did not deserve such a talented dog.",
      "He spied Emma Newland barreling around the corner with Snickers, a twelve-year-old rescue. At this distance, he could not run nor could he hide from his former church secretary and personal Genghis Kahn. He zipped his jacket, turned up the collar, armored himself. He could tell by Gus's bark that his dog was not into this encounter; Gus had met Snickers on other occasions and was unimpressed.",
      "'Why don't you get another leash?' she yelled over the barking.",
      "'This leash is fine,' he yelled back.",
      "'Seems like it would remind you of you know who.'",
      "She had seldom called his former companion by name.",
      "'I like being reminded of Barnabas!' he shouted into the din.",
      "Snickers retreated behind his owner, growling, as Gus took leeway to sniff Emma's shoes. Black. Sturdy. Size ten. Triple A. She was proud of the triple A. As her former priest and so-called boss, he knew almost everything about this woman whose desk had sat less than three feet from his own. He had to hand it to her \u2013 Emma Newland could, in a heartbeat, make three feet feel like three inches.",
      "She gave him the eye, as if she'd caught him being naughty in some inconceivable way. 'What brings you out so early?'",
      "'Gus!' he said.",
      "Up ahead, the first squirrel of the morning. And away they went at a trot.",
      "He and Gus were blowing across the parking lot at Mitford School when he met Grace Murphy, speed-walking toward the school's front entrance. Blond hair in braids, bifocals firmly in place, a wide-open smile displaying a hatchwork of braces on wayward teeth. Grace was one of his favorite people.",
      "'Good morning, Father! And good morning, Gusarino.' She stooped, girded by a backpack of considerable size, to give his happy dog a head scratch.",
      "'We're glad to see you out brightening up the world,' he said.",
      "'I'm reading to our English class this morning. I'm sort of nervous!'",
      "'What are you reading?'",
      "'Willa Cather On Writing.'",
      "'Willa Cather? Remind me what grade you're in?'",
      "'Fifth because I skipped third,' she said. 'Next week, we'll be reading from Eudora Welty's book on writing. I'm co-teaching a whole American Literature unit with Miss Phillips. Got to go, Father! Bye, Gussie! Have a great day!'",
      "'The Lord be with you!' he called after her.",
      "'And also with you!' she called back. Grace was an acolyte at Lord's Chapel, wise in the ways of liturgical response.",
      "He felt the smile on his face, the way it softened his skin that was busy drinking clean mountain air.",
      "Two squirrels later, he was back in the kitchen, staring at The List.",
      "He was a dash fatigued from their walk. Supplying St. Mark's in Holding had been a mixed blessing. Full priestly duties June through October, combined with driving up and down the mountain, had been a stretch. In the five months of priesting a troubled parish, he had counted heavily on the prayer that never fails.",
      "Back to business.",
      "His mother had been the Christmas-list maker of all time \u2013 everything inscribed in a stenographer's notebook by July seventh, when she closed her gardens to the public. She set at once to the task of making pin cushions, pillowcases, embroidered dresser scarves, the occasional sweater or baby blanket, and stacks of tea towels and aprons from printed flour sacks.",
      "'Th' woman is an industry,' said his grandfather.",
      "She also used flour sacks to make his boxers for her mortified son. He could depend on the sight of them under the tree \u2013 a starched four-pack wrapped in white tissue and adorned with a holly sprig.",
      "He remembered hiding like a common thief when exchanging his britches for running shorts in the school locker room. He had nonetheless been spied in this covert maneuver, and the shamings were a memory he detested. He was fourteen when he finally wrangled store-bought from his mother, the family exchequer.",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 10:26:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The bestselling author had said she would no longer write novels set in the make-believe mountain village of Mitford. After the death of her daughter, she wrote through her grief \u2013 which led to her 15th Mitford book, \"My Beloved.\"",
    "story": [
      "For one weekend only, hundreds of devoted readers gathered in Hudson, North Carolina, to celebrate Mitford, a fictional place with a real sense of community. Jan Karon, the 88-year-old author behind Mitford, has written 15 books about the make-believe mountain village.",
      "Asked how to describe the town of Mitford, Karon said it is \"a place my readers can go and not be afraid. It's a place of refuge. It's where they can go, get a deep breath.\"",
      "The humanity of Karon's characters has found a faithful following that's perennially put her novels on the bestseller list. But for some people, she's not a household name like other bestselling authors. Asked why, Karon said, \"I don't give you much of a ride. I just give you sort of a float! A lot of people tell me that my books put them to sleep, and I consider that a huge compliment!\"",
      "Karon's super-fans say the books are more than page turners. According to Nellie McMasters, \"We are in such an uncertain period, we're in such turmoil, that it's just a nice, pleasant place.\"",
      "\"And it's not divisive,\" said Joellen Maurer. \"This is just love your neighbor, know the people who live around you.\"",
      "Asked if she believes places like Mitford exist in America today, Phyllis Farringer replied, \"They do, where there's a community of faith and people caring about each other, and I see it.\"",
      "Jan Karon was raised by her grandmother, Fannie, in Hudson, and attended elementary school there. Almost eight decades later, she converted the site to the Mitford Museum.",
      "She credits her first grade teacher Nan Downs with encouraging her creativity. By age 10, Karon says, she knew she wanted to be a writer: \"I stood in front of this very mirror, and I said, I'm going to be an author.\"",
      "How did she know? \"I just knew,\" Karon said. \"I love to read. And so, I wanted to give other people what I received from reading, which was that whole other world.\"",
      "At 14, Karon found herself wanting to escape her world, so she got married, dropped out of school, and gave birth to her daughter, Candace, a year later. She was divorced at 18.",
      "\"A lot of it was really hard, because I became a single mom and had to raise her by myself when I myself had hardly been raised,\" she said.",
      "She worked a series of jobs, including TV producer. She was later fired, and says that was her turning point: \"It brought me to my knees; I'd never been on my knees,\" Karon said. \"I was 42. I just went down: I don't know what to pray for. I'm just here, and I need help and just change me.\"",
      "She became a successful advertising executive, but says she felt called to write more than ads. So, she quit her job, and began weaving her faith into her short stories. She published her work for free in a local newspaper, eventually turning those tales into her first Mitford novel, \"At Home in Mitford,\" in 1994.",
      "I asked, \"I think that when people think about your books and your work, they often think comforting, they think maybe clean, Christian.\"",
      "\"I'm grateful for my Christian readers, very grateful,\" Karon said. \"But I write for a secular audience. God poured his love into me, and you can't say, well, I just can't talk about that in my books.\"",
      "Her latest Mitford work, \"My Beloved,\" is all about presence, aging, and connection. Karon says it was one of the most challenging things she's ever written \u2013 and comes after having said she would never write another Mitford book.",
      "In 2008, she began a short story set during Christmas, but it sat unfinished for more than a decade. In 2021, her daughter, Candace, died of cancer. Karon was moved to write through her grief. The finished work, now a novel, is dedicated to her daughter,",
      "\"She was the sunshine of my life,\" Karon said of Candace.",
      "I asked, \"Do you ever talk to her while you're sitting here writing?\"",
      "\"All the time,\" she replied. \"And I know this sounds corny, but it's true for me, right here, she'll say, 'I hear you, Mom. It's okay, Mom. Everything's gonna be all right.'\"",
      "\"How did losing Candace change your life?\"",
      "\"I'm less judgmental,\" Karon replied. \"I'm a little easier, even on myself. And I've always been really hard on myself. I know that we don't have forever anymore, which is a thing in this book. So, what can we do with this time? Something better than what we're doing? Or even just something more fun? We don't have to be noble all the time.\"",
      "Jan Karon invites us to look for community and neighborly love, to find our own kind of Mitford. \"If you will just get in your car and drive out into America, I'm telling you, I can guarantee, I promise you, that it is out there. You have to look for it. It's not going to come to you and sit on your doorstep. You've got to go out and get it, and it's there for the taking.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 09:18:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Tilly Norwood is unlike any other aspiring TV or movie star: Tilly is entirely generated by artificial intelligence. What might that mean for the media industry?",
    "story": [
      "At the dawn of this century, Al Pacino starred in \"S1m0ne,\" a satire about a down-on-his-luck director who creates a computer-generated \"star\" that conquers Hollywood. Fast forward nearly 25 years, and it appears that real life has caught up with the movies, with the introduction of an AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood.",
      "News of an AI actress triggered a bit of a Hollywood freak-out about that timeless worry of who gets the part, from Whoopi Goldberg (\"Bring it on, because you can always tell them from us\"), to Emily Blunt (\"Good Lord, we're screwed\").",
      "Tilly's creator, Eline van der Velden, says she did not expect the backlash: \"No, not at all. But at the same time, I had created her to resonate internationally, right? I had created her to become a global superstar.\"",
      "Van der Velden, herself a former actor and comedienne, aimed high because she thinks generative AI is ready for its closeup \u2013 saving money, and adding creativity. \"I was just trying to educate those industry individuals at that time about what's possible,\" she said.",
      "Bringing Tilly to life took van der Velden's team some 2,000 iterations. Then, she began to teach her to act. She showed us some early iterations of Tilly emoting. \"We were starting to try different emotions with her,\" she said. \"Here we did some tests. We didn't think the acting was very good at all.\"",
      "\"It wasn't up to your standards?\" I asked.",
      "\"It was not up to my standards at all!\"",
      "In an interview this past July with the British publication Broadcast International, van der Velden made the provocative statement, \"We want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that's the aim of what we're doing.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson of the AI genre,\" she told us. \"I think that was what was missed. There was a lot of misinformation. She's not meant to take real acting jobs in the traditional film and TV industry. She's meant to stay in her own AI genre, and that's where we want her to stay.\"",
      "Still, she says her firm has fielded requests for Tilly to appear in a film opposite real actors. \"We have said no to any offers,\" van der Velden said.",
      "\"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up\"",
      "Sean Astin is the president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, where Tilly Norwood has struck a nerve about the state of AI. Asked what Tilly represents to him, Astin replied, \"Avatar and character seem like fair labels. Actress, not so much. She \u2013 she? It? \u2013 simply will not replace our people.\"",
      "He says right now in Hollywood artificial intelligence feels like a tsunami: \"The onslaught of AI products and AI technology and its uses is, it's overwhelming. I would just as soon \u2013 as citizens and as a union \u2013 that we surf the wave, that we surf the wave of incoming stuff.\"",
      "For the union, AI protections were a major point of contention in the 2023 strike, and Astin says safeguarding a performer's name, image and likeness from being harvested without compensation is a top priority going forward. \"Eline has every right to use open source, publicly available, legal information to build her creative things,\" he said. \"My issue and our company's issue is with the companies that design those systems and scrape the internet and ingest them. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "Astin applauds producers who are trying to push the creative envelope using AI. But, he adds, \"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up. If you push the envelope, you say, 'Hey, how can human-centered artistry collaborate with this technology to achieve some communication that feels good to an audience?' And then there's like, 'Oh, by the way, we think it's cheaper, easier, and you know, we don't want to hire you as an actor.'\"",
      "\"Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\"",
      "Already, AI-generated scenes have appeared in TV series like Amazon's \"House of David.\" There are AI commercials, and over the summer, an AI model appeared in an ad in Vogue magazine for the first time.",
      "For producers, facing ballooning production budgets, AI has triggered a range of emotions. Former entertainment executive Kevin Reilly explains: \"Excitement, confusion, fear, trying to figure out how to use this. Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\" he said. \"It is, in my opinion, very much a friend. It is the most transformative thing that's happened maybe in the history of Man.\"",
      "Reilly is now something of an AI evangelist. He's the new CEO of Kartel.ai, a Beverly Hills startup that makes AI videos and ad campaigns. \"Everything comes with a downside,\" he said. \"But that is not the reason to just categorically be fearful of this.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of this is driven by studios and streaming platforms and brands wanting to just save money?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I think it's not necessarily, 'Hey, we wanna save money,'\" said Reilly. \"It's that the bottom line \u2013 you know, they are businesses.\"",
      "And for businesses, the creative upside can be extraordinary. Kartel wanted to show off a bit, and put generative engineer Fillip Isgro in the driver's seat. He showed us a concept for a coffee commercial, Cup of Jo. The ad featured multiple versions of \u2026 me! It was a little jarring.",
      "He began with an old-fashioned storyboard, building an AI world directed by a human. \"What does the coffee shop look like? What does the logo look like? And finally, what do you look like? With your permission, we went on your Instagram and we collected all of your photos.\"",
      "That's all he needed to generate my face. And with just a few commands, Cup of Jo went global, with images of Jo's Coffee Shop on a barge in the middle of the ocean; on a volcano in Hawaii; and in the Alps.",
      "\"The next step in our journey is, we bring it to life,\" Isgro said. \"We actually bring motion into our stills. I just whip out my iPhone, I record who I need to, and then I can just instantly get the character doing the thing that I need them to do.\"",
      "The result: a flashy new ad created in just a couple of days, using no ad agency, no locations, and none of my time.",
      "\"Imagine having to go and shoot that. You don't get that flexibility\" in a traditional ad, Isgro said. \"And it's a very planned thing. You have to stick to scripts, and that's it. But in this world, we can iterate indefinitely without repercussion.\"",
      "It's the story of our time: the tug of war between artificial intelligence (\"This tech is here. It's not gonna go anywhere. How can we use it as a force for good?\" asks Eline van der Velden) and humanity (\"Artificial intelligence will never replace us, ever,\" says Sean Astin) that, for now, is something of a cliffhanger.",

    "story": [
      "Prominent American playwright and actor, Jeremy O. Harris, known for his Tony-nominated \"Slave Play\" and his role in the Netflix series \"Emily in Paris,\" was arrested in Japan on suspicion of smuggling the psychedelic drug ecstasy, officials said Saturday.",
      "Officers at Naha Airport on Japan's southern island of Okinawa arrested Harris on Nov. 16 for an alleged violation of customs law for having 0.78 grams, or 0.0275 ounces, of the crystalized drug, also known as MDMA, in a container in a tote bag he was carrying, according to Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson Tatsunori Fukuda.",
      "Harris, 36, had left London's Heathrow Airport two days earlier and transited in Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport before arriving in Naha for sightseeing, Fukuda said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination with mild weather throughout the year.",
      "Fukuda said Harris was arrested on the spot and taken into custody by the Tomishiro police, which filed a criminal complaint to the Naha District Prosecutors' Office on Thursday for further investigation and possible indictment. CBS News has reached out to the Tomishiro police for additional comment.",
      "Japanese authorities did not find any other drugs in his luggage and believe the MDMA was for his personal use. They are still investigating, Fukuda said, while adding that whether Harris made any comment on the case could not be released.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Harris' representatives. Harris has not publicly commented on his arrest.",
      "CBS News reached out to the U.S. Embassy in Japan for additional comment.",
      "Japanese criminal procedures allow investigators to keep a suspect in custody for up to 23 days before indictment, and pretrial detention can be prolonged if the accused exercises their right of silence or denies the charges, a practice widely criticized as \"hostage justice.\"",
      "Those convicted of drug smuggling in Japan can face a multiyear prison term.",
      "Harris burst onto the arts scene with \"Slave Play,\" written while he was still a graduate student at the Yale School of Drama. It premiered off-Broadway in 2018, inciting controversy and even a petition to shut down the production with its provocative mix of race, class and sexual taboos. It moved to Broadway the following year, earning a Tony nomination for best play, but did not win an award.",
      "The play returned for a short run on Broadway in December 2021.",
      "\"There haven't been enough chances for us to reflect who we are to the world and to ourselves and to ponder what that reflection means, and so this is what 'Slave Play' gets to do for people,\" Harris told CBS New York in 2021.",
      "In addition to small acting roles, he's cameoed as himself on a rebooted \"Gossip Girl\" and served as a co-producer on several episodes of HBO's hit series \"Euphoria.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump is hosting the Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday after presenting medals to the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees during an Oval Office ceremony Saturday.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0ignored the Kennedy Center\u00a0and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has\u00a0instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who\u00a0voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances\u00a0and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "In a presidential first, Mr. Trump is hosting the\u00a0Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0himself on Sunday.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be\u00a0broadcast Dec. 23 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS television stations and Paramount+.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said Sunday as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",

      "But Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that \"there's only going to be one winner\" as nations race to dominate artificial intelligence, and China's central government gives its companies a single place to go for government approvals.",
      "\"We have the big investment coming, but if they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you can forget it because it's impossible to do,\" the president said.",
      "The executive order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to create a new task force to challenge state laws, and directs the Department of Commerce to draw up a list of problematic regulations. It also threatens to restrict funding from a broadband deployment program and other grant programs to states with AI laws.",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist who is leading Mr. Trump's policies on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, said Thursday the Trump administration would only push back on \"the most onerous examples of state regulation\" but would not oppose \"kid safety\" measures.",
      "Four states \u2014 Colorado, California, Utah and Texas \u2014 have passed laws that set some rules for AI across the private sector, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals.",
      "Those laws include limiting the collection of certain personal information and requiring more transparency from companies.",
      "The laws are in response to AI that already pervades everyday life. The technology helps make consequential decisions for Americans, including who gets a job interview, an apartment lease, a home loan and even certain medical care. But research has shown that it can make mistakes in those decisions, including by prioritizing a particular gender or race.",
      "States' more ambitious AI regulation proposals require private companies to provide transparency and assess the possible risks of discrimination from their AI programs.",
      "Beyond those more sweeping rules, many states have regulated parts of AI: barring the use of deepfakes in elections and to create nonconsensual porn, for example, or putting rules in place around the government's own use of AI.",
      "Those who support regulations that would prevent states from restricting AI\u00a0\u2014 including some GOP lawmakers and advocates like Sacks \u2014 argue that forcing tech companies to contend with varied or even contradictory rules would hurt the industry.",
      "\"At best, we'll end up with 50 different AI models for 50 different states \u2013 a regulatory morass worse than Europe,\" Sacks wrote on X\u00a0earlier this week. \"This will stymie innovation, especially by small startups who can't afford the compliance burden. Meanwhile, China will race ahead.\"",
      "But members of both parties have pushed back. Last month, when congressional Republicans weighed adding restrictions on state AI regulations to a defense bill, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis called the idea a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"",
      "\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,\" the governor wrote.",
      "Earlier this week, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Mr. Trump's plan to restrict AI regulations via an executive order an \"early Christmas present for his CEO billionaire buddies.\"",

      "The 15-member panel, known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to help spot and defuse systemic financial risks.",
      "The council is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes the leaders from other financial regulatory agencies, such as the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the head of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.",
      "In a letter released Thursday, Bessent called for looser FSOC regulations, saying that \"too often in the past, efforts to safeguard the financial system have resulted in burdensome and often duplicative regulations.\"",

      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also attacked the decision to loosen financial regulations.",
      "\"Going down this path just as cracks are emerging in the financial system and yellow lights are flashing across our economy is especially reckless,\" she said in a statement, citing the recent bankruptcies of subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings, auto parts company First Brands and home remodeling platform Renovo Home Partners.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-gold-card-website-1-million-platinum-card-how-it-works/",
    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:48:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration says it's also creating a $5 million platinum card visa that will allow foreigners to live in the U.S. for 270 days a year.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is touting his administration's new \"gold card\" visa as a fast track for foreigners who are willing and able to pay $1 million for the right to immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Applications for the new visa went live on Wednesday afternoon, with the government website for the gold card saying the process can be completed in a matter of weeks after applicants file their paperwork.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the gold card initiative in February, promoting it as an expedited path for wealthy foreigners to secure legal residency and as a way to generate government revenue. The term riffs on the \"green card,\" which grants permanent residency status to noncitizens so they can live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.",
      "\"All funds go to the United States government \u2014 it could be a tremendous amount of money,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday about the gold card. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card.\"",
      "The program also includes a $2 million gold card for corporations that want to secure visas for workers, as well as a $5 million platinum card that allows foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being required to pay federal income tax on non-U.S. income.",
      "\"It's certainly plausible to me that this could be a meaningful source of revenue,\" John Lettieri, the CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan policy research group, told CBS News.",
      "But, he added, the gold card visa is likely to be a \"niche program,\" given the cost, although it could help attract some highly skilled foreign workers or entrepreneurs to the U.S.",
      "Here's how the gold card program will work.",
      "What is a Trump gold card?",
      "In essence, it's a green card that has been fast-tracked by the Trump administration.",
      "The website to apply for a gold card states that successful applicants will receive either an EB-1 or EB-2 visa, two kinds of employment-based green cards for skilled workers. To apply for an individual gold card, applicants must:",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.",
      "Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "The new program also allows companies to obtain gold cards for employees, one per worker, with each requiring a $2 million donation, according to the website.",
      "Applicants must pay a $15,000 fee that will cover the cost of processing and conducting a background check, along with a 1% annual maintenance fee. Companies may also transfer the gold card between employees for a 5% transfer fee, the program specifies.",
      "A transfer could happen if a gold card holder becomes a U.S. citizen, for example.",
      "One potential difference between the Trump gold card and other types of green cards is that the new visa process could take only weeks, according to the Trump administration.",
      "By comparison, immigrants who apply for a regular green card can expect to wait between eight months and three years for approval, according to immigration services company Boundless. The quickest processing time is for spouses of U.S. citizens, who typically face an eight-month wait, the group said.",
      "How is the Trump gold card different from an EB-5 visa?",
      "The gold card is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which Congress created in 1990 to generate foreign investment. These have been available to people who spend at least $1 million to start a company with at least 10 workers.",
      "Unlike the EB-5 visa, however, a gold card visa doesn't require applicants to create a certain number of jobs or to invest in U.S. businesses.",
      "The EB-5 program has been criticized as cumbersome and as an invitation to commit fraud. In one notable case in recent years, hundreds of EB-5 applicants were defrauded by business executives in Vermont who claimed to be building a biotech facility, but who instead used the money for personal expenses.",
      "The process to obtain an EB-5 visa is also glacially slow, with a processing time of almost six years. That is \"by far the longest processing times in the U.S. immigration system,\" according to an April blog post about the Trump gold cards from EIG.",
      "The gold card is designed to help companies recruit foreign graduates of U.S. universities such as MIT and Harvard, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "\"I've heard from Tim Cook of Apple, and I've heard from a lot of people, some of the people at this table, that essentially, in the United States, you can't keep the student,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Can gold card holders become citizens?",
      "Gold card recipients \"have a path to citizenship,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference on Wednesday with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Obviously, they have to be perfect people in America, and having passed the vetting, after five years they'll be available to become citizens,\" Lutnick said.",
      "Green card holders can typically apply for citizenship after residing in the U.S. for five years.",
      "Companies that secure a gold card for workers who then become citizens can transfer the card to new employees, Lutnick added.",
      "Can a gold card visa be revoked?",
      "Yes: The application website states: \"The Trump Gold Card is a visa; therefore, national security and significant criminal risks are a basis for revocation.\"",
      "How much money could the visa program raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump didn't provide an estimate this week, but the program could generate billions in annual revenue, said Lettieri of the Economic Innovation Group.",
      "Based on the $1 million cost of a gold card visa, the program could raise $100 billion over a decade if it issues 10,000 gold cards per year, he calculated.",
      "\"Conservatively speaking, tens of billions over a decade is reasonable \u2014 it could be considerably higher,\" Lettieri said.",

      "For Trista Hamsmith, the safety risks posed by some products are personal. In December 2020, her 18-month-old daughter Reese died after swallowing a button battery she accessed from a remote two months earlier.",
      "The batteries are tiny, coin-sized and deadly when ingested. It burned through Reese's esophagus and after months of surgeries, doctors couldn't save her.",
      "\"I prayed and I prayed, but we didn't get her back. I got to hold her again, but she was gone,\" Hamsmith said, recalling the moment. \"She was a baby and her life was taken too soon.\"",

      "He also claims more than a dozen other proposed safety rules have stalled since then.",
      "\"People will be injured and people will die as a result of inaction from CPSC,\" Trumka said.",
      "The CPSC was created by Congress as an independent agency with five bipartisan commissioners, meant to be free of political pressure.",
      "\"CPSC is a health and safety organization,\" said former CPSC chair Hoehn-Saric. \"You want organizations like that to be focused on the facts and focused on the science because we're trying to keep people from dying. You don't want politics to come into those decisions.\"",

      "With a single commissioner, Trumka said protections can't be passed.",
      "\"We have quorum requirements that to pass a rule, you need two commissioners. They have one,\" he said. \"It shows they have no intent to pass new rules to protect the public against problems that are coming up.\"",

    "title": "Trump says \"prices are coming down.\" Here's what the data shows.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-speech-affordability-fact-check-inflation-data/",
    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump says he's winning the war against inflation. But a look at prices around the U.S. shows why many Americans still feel financially squeezed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump delivered a message Tuesday evening aimed at the millions of Americans struggling to afford daily necessities, saying his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and that \"prices are coming down tremendously.\" Economic data tells a different story.",
      "Prices have edged higher for much of Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, with inflation in September rising at an annual rate of 3% (the most recent available inflation data because of the recent U.S. government shutdown).",
      "Inflation dipped to a low this year of 2.3% in April, but it has steadily ticked up since then and now stands at the same rate as in January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated, federal data shows. Economists attribute the rise partly to the Trump administration's new tariffs on imports, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointing to those levies as a key factor behind the recent uptick.",
      "Inflation now \"is higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the impact of tariffs,\" Powell said at a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the central bank's latest interest rate cut.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think prices are likely to continue creeping up for a while. Mark Vickery, senior market analyst at Zacks Investment Research, estimates that the Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of around 3.3% in November.",
      "To be sure, many economists, as well as the Fed, expect any additional pickup in inflation to be short-lived before easing in 2026. Powell on Wednesday said the tariff effect will likely create a one-time rise in prices that should fade over the coming year. The Fed expects inflation to recede to 2.4% next year, down from about 2.9% in 2025.",
      "From a longer-term perspective, inflation has indeed fallen sharply since hitting a 40-year high of about 9% in June 2022 in the aftermath of the pandemic. For shoppers, however, a lower inflation rate doesn't mean prices are declining \u2014 only that they're rising at a slower pace.",
      "Consumers tend not to view pocketbook issues through the lens of official inflation measures, a somewhat abstract metric that tracks price fluctuations over time, experts have long noted. Instead, many shoppers focus on their actual dollars-and-cents spending, including whether their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than they were in the past, according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "By that yardstick, Americans are spending more on everyday basics than they were a year ago, and far more than they did just before the pandemic, CPI data shows.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks, made Tuesday in Mount Pocono, Pa., came as his administration touts the president's economic policies ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"I have no higher priority than making America affordable,\" Mr. Trump said in the speech.",
      "Prior to the speech, Mr. Trump had decried affordability as a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats, although some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have differed with him on the issue. Greene told CBS News that she doesn't believe affordability is a hoax, adding, \"Everyone's bills have either stayed the same or gone up.\"",
      "\"You can't gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable,\" Greene said.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai expressed confidence that Mr. Trump's agenda will cool inflation and boost worker wages.",
      "\"President Trump inherited the worst inflation crisis in a generation from Joe Biden's incompetence, and his Administration has rapidly cooled inflation to a 2.5% annualized rate,\" Desai said in a statement to CBS News. \"As the administration's supply-side policies of tax cuts, deregulation and energy abundance continue taking effect, Americans can count on inflation continuing to fall and real wages continuing to rise.\"",
      "Food",
      "Americans paid 2.7% more for food bought at the grocery store in September than they did a year earlier, according to the most recent CPI figures. That may not seem like much, but their grocery bills have climbed roughly 49% since 2020.",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "Some food costs are also rising much faster than the rate of inflation, with beef steaks surging almost 17% from a year ago, according to the CPI data. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sought to lower some grocery prices by exempting foods like beef, coffee and bananas from new country-specific tariffs.",
      "Shoppers on Tuesday told CBS News' Nancy Cordes that they are making tradeoffs and scrimping to afford groceries.",
      "\"The cost of beef is astronomical. I will mainly get what's on sale,\" Anne Marie Hadley, a retired special education teacher who was shopping Tuesday at Schiel's Family Market, a family-owned grocery store in Scranton, Pa., told Cordes.",
      "Housing",
      "While mortgage rates have dropped this year, housing remains out of reach for most would-be buyers. More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a report this week.",
      "A homebuyer today needs to earn $131,400 a year to afford a typical home in the U.S. \u2014 almost double the roughly $65,000 needed five years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "Gas",
      "One area where consumers are getting a break is at the pump, with gasoline prices down from a year earlier. Gas declined 0.5% in September from a year earlier, CPI data shows. And earlier this month, gas dropped below $3 a gallon on average, marking the lowest price since May 2021.",
      "\"It was just reported that four states had $1.99 a gallon,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \"We are right now involved in more energy, and have more energy in the works by far than we've ever had before.\"",
      "The decline is due to strong refinery output and lower crude oil prices, as well as to softer seasonal fuel demand, GasBuddy has said.",
      "Yet while fuel prices have dropped, other energy costs have increased. Residential electricity prices around the U.S. rose more than 10% over the first eight months of 2025, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an educational and policy organization. By comparison, power costs rose roughly 6% over the trailing 12 months.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 U.S. households was seriously behind on their utility bills, according to a report from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. Over the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the groups found.",

      "The recall affects certain 5th-generation automated driving systems, according to a Nov. 8 notice posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The software may cause vehicles to pass a stopped school bus even when its red lights are flashing or its stop arm is extended, increasing the risk of a crash with a pedestrian, the agency said.",

      "As of Dec. 5, the Austin Independent School District said it was aware of 20 incidents this school year in which a Waymo vehicle illegally passed a school bus. JJ Maldonado, a communications specialist for the school district, told CBS News last week that a 20th citation was issued after Waymo said it had fixed the software issue.",

    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors in New York moved Tuesday to drop charges against Hernan Lopez, a former Fox employee who was convicted of paying tens of millions of dollars in bribes to secure broadcasting rights to the World Cup and other top soccer matches, as well as the company involved in the scandal.",
      "The move would end a yearslong legal battle by past Justice Departments to preserve the convictions, which are currently caught in a slate of appeals.",
      "In a\u00a0letter dated Tuesday\u00a0to U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen, who oversaw the case, U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York Joseph Nocella said the charges against Lopez and Full Play Group, the Argentine sports media rights company involved in the scandal, should be dismissed \"in the interests of justice.\"",
      "In a Supreme Court filing relating to Lopez's ongoing appeal to the high court filed Tuesday, the Solicitor General's Office wrote that dismissal of the case is warranted for the same reason, and that the court should hear Lopez's appeal, reverse an appeals court decision that reinstated the conviction, and return the case to a New York federal judge who could dismiss the case.",
      "Lopez was convicted in 2024 by a jury in Brooklyn on charges of money laundering, conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy. Full Play was convicted of two additional counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering relating to the World Cup and Copa America.",
      "Earlier this year, a federal appeals court ordered the reinstatement of the convictions of Lopez and Full Play after Chen granted a motion for acquittal in 2024. The Biden-era Justice Department appealed that ruling.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:59:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is grappling with economic issues including higher inflation and a slowing labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the federal funds rate to its lowest level in more than three years.",
      "The reduction lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%, down from its prior range of 3.75% to 4%. The Fed's decision marks the third consecutive rate cut since September, lowering the federal funds rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points this year.",
      "Despite the lack of key government economic data because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown, the Fed has been closely monitoring the slowdown in monthly job growth as well as rising inflation. Figures from ADP, which tracks private payrolls, showed that employers shed 32,000 jobs in November, a signal of continuing headwinds in the labor market.",
      "Fed hints at one rate cut in 2026",
      "But in announcing the decision, the Federal Reserve signaled that it may want to see more economic evidence to support additional rate cuts in 2026. In quarterly economic projections issued along with their latest statement, Fed officials signaled they expect to lower rates just once next year.",
      "\"In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, said in its statement.",
      "Speaking about the decision in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves\" before deciding on another cut.",
      "\"We're going to get a great deal of data between now and the January meeting \u2014 the data we get will factor into our thinking,\" Powell said, referring to the delayed November inflation and job reports that will be issued later this month. \"We're well-positioned to wait and see.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve also issued new U.S. inflation, economic growth and unemployment projections for 2026, forecasting that inflation will cool slightly next year while unemployment will remain unchanged from its current level of 4.4%.",
      "Fed officials forecast that Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, will cool to 2.4% next year, down from its median estimate of 2.9% in 2025. The nation's gross domestic product could pick up to 2.3% in 2026, an acceleration from the Fed's September forecast of 1.8%.",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief global economist at Oxford Economics, said the latest Fed guidance sets it up for what he described in a note to investors as an \"extended pause\" in cutting rates.",
      "\"The Fed isn't going to be able to help the labor market because of what ails it,\" he added. \"Rate cuts are unlikely to significantly boost the hiring rate, which is being depressed by overhiring, solid productivity growth, policy uncertainty, a rise in people with multiple jobs and less immigration. Monetary policy can't solve many of these issues.\"",
      "The move lowers the federal funds rate to its lowest level since early November 2022, when policymakers lifted the range to 3.75% to 4%. At that time, the central bank was boosting rates \u2014 its most potent tool for curbing inflation \u2014 as inflation surged during the pandemic.",
      "By cutting rates, the Fed is acting to spur hiring by making credit cheaper, allowing businesses to expand and hire at a lower cost. Consumers, meanwhile, tend to spend more when financing is less expensive, giving the broader economy an extra lift.",
      "FOMC dissents",
      "Not all members of the FOMC, the Fed's rate-setting panel, agreed with the move to cut by a quarter point. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell was joined by eight other committee members in voting in favor of the reduction, three members dissented, the Fed said. That represents the most dissents in six years and is a sign of divisions on a committee that traditionally works by consensus.",
      "FOMC members Austan Goolsbee and Jeffrey Schmid voted to maintain the previous range, while Stephen Miran voted in favor of a 0.5 percentage-point cut.",
      "At the same time, the Fed is moving toward a leadership shift next year, with Powell set to end his term as chair in May 2026 and President Trump preparing to nominate his replacement.",
      "\"[T]he outlook from the Powell-led FOMC bears less than usual on future Fed policy decisions given the imminent change in leadership,\" Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said in an email.",
      "Asked what his goals are during the last months of his term as chair, Powell said he's focused on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"I want to turn over this job to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"All my efforts are to get to that place.\"",

      "Only five states don't sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.",
      "While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning still remain extremely low. Over the last three decades, both games have been redesigned multiple times. Changes have pushed jackpots higher while also adding more ways for players to win smaller prizes.",
      "Powerball players choose five numbers from 1 to 69 and one Powerball number from 1 to 26. In 2015, Powerball increased its number of white balls from 59 to 69 and its number of red balls decreased from 35 to 26.",
      "Before the change, the odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 175.2 million and the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 31.85. After the redesign, the jackpot odds became steeper, 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize improved to 1 in 24.9, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.",
      "Mega Millions requires players to pick five different numbers from one to 70 and one Mega Ball number from one to 24. A ticket wins the jackpot by matching all six numbers in a drawing.",
      "In 2025, Mega Millions changed its games to a larger starting jackpot ($50 million vs. $20 million), which \"improved odds to win the jackpot and improved overall odds,\" according to Dan Miller, a spokesperson for Mega Millions.",
      "\"Everyone who wins is winning more because of the embedded multiplier in the new game that takes all non-jackpot prizes and multiplies them by 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X,\" Miller said in an email. Through Friday, Dec. 5, he said, \"there have been 70 drawings in the new game. In that time, players have won $531 million in non-jackpot prizes. In the old game, those same prizes would have been valued at $119.8 million. That's a 343% increase in player winnings.\"",
      "For example, under the old rules, matching just the Mega Ball was a break-even outcome: a $2 ticket earned a $2 prize. Under the new game, that same match now comes with a built-in multiplier. The minimum prize is $5, which is then multiplied \u2014 meaning a player can now win $10, $15, $20, $25 or even $50 instead of just $2.",
      "The odds to win the jackpot improved from 1 in 302.6 million to\u00a01 in 290.5 million. This is because of Mega Millions removing the one gold Mega Ball from the game, Miller said.",
      "The new game has 24 Mega Balls instead of 25, which improves the odds of picking the right combinations of numbers to win the jackpot. The overall odds to win any prize went from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23.",
      "There's more money in play as well: Powerball increased the price of a ticket from $1 to $2 in 2012. Mega Millions increased its ticket prices from $1 to $2 in 2017 and from $2 to $5 in April of this year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loan-repayment-save-plan-ending/",
    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 14:47:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Current SAVE borrowers will have \"limited time\" to enroll in a new loan repayment plan and begin repaying their loans, the Education Department said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reached an agreement that could end President Biden's signature student loan repayment plan, a move that may force millions of borrowers back into repayment.",
      "The Education Department on Tuesday announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri that it said would terminate the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, an income-driven repayment plan that tabulates loan repayments based on a borrower's income and family size.",
      "As part of the deal, which is pending court approval, the agency said it will not enroll any new borrowers in the SAVE plan and will deny all pending applications. All current SAVE borrowers will have a \"limited time\" to enroll in a new plan and begin repayments, according to the department's notice.",
      "Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz told CNBC that borrowers may need to leave SAVE forbearance early next year. That's a quicker timeline than what was laid out in The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July.",
      "That law gave borrowers enrolled in SAVE and other soon-to-be-phased-out repayment programs until July 1, 2028, to move to a new plan.",
      "Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in Tuesday's announcement that the Biden Administration's policies unfairly shifted student loan debt onto American taxpayers. The Education Department said the SAVE program would have cost taxpayers more than $342 billion over ten years.",
      "The Education Department declined to comment, pointing CBS News to a Dec. 9\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed written by Kent and Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway,",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't blind to the mounting student debt burden or the skyrocketing costs of a college degree,\" they wrote. \"But we refuse to force hardworking Americans to bear the burden of loans that aren't theirs.\"",
      "The Biden administration\u00a0announced\u00a0the SAVE program in 2023, calling it the \"most affordable student loan repayment plan ever.\" The plan allowed 4.6 million of the program's more than 7 million enrollees to lower their monthly bills to $0 per month,\u00a0according\u00a0to Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group.",
      "Tuesday's announcement is the latest development in a months-long legal battle over the program's fate, which has left millions of SAVE borrowers in limbo.",
      "The SAVE plan received pushback from attorneys general from several Republican-led states, including Missouri, which sued in 2024, arguing the plan overstepped the Biden administration's authority. In February 2025, a circuit court ruled the SAVE plan was unlawful, according to the Education Department.",
      "As the legal battle played out, SAVE borrowers were put in forbearance in July 2024, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "In July 2025, the Education Department said it would restart charging interest on the loans beginning Aug. 1, a move advocacy group Protect Borrowers said could cost enrollees $300 per month due to new interest charges.",
      "Tuesday's agreement will \"strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan,\" Protect Borrowers deputy executive director and managing counsel Persis Yu said in a statement.",
      "The Education Department is advising SAVE borrowers to use the Federal Student Aid Loan Simulator tool to explore other repayment plans.",
      "As Kent and Hanaway\u00a0note\u00a0in their Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act creates a single new income-driven repayment plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan, which has a repayment window of up to 30 years. The plan will be available for new borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026, along with a separate standard repayment plan, according to the Education Department.",

      "Those crosscurrents have left workers feeling generally exhausted, according to the job search firm, which on Wednesday named \"fatigue\" as its 2025 word of the year based on how often Glassdoor users mentioned it in the company's online forum. Glassdoor said use of the word in its online community jumped 41% in 2025, compared with the previous year.",
      "\"When we asked professionals in the spring, 'Do you feel like events in the news are draining your energy at work?', 78% said yes. Turns out, that exhaustion never really went away,\" Glassdoor said.",
      "Economic worries were also front and center, with many Glassdoor users expressing frustration that their paychecks have not kept pace with inflation. Mentions of \"stagflation,\" the economic term used to describe periods marked by high prices and weak economic growth, spiked threefold compared to last year, according to Glassdoor.",
      "Such concerns appear to jibe with rising public concerns about the cost of food, housing and other necessities.",
      "Chatter about AI disrupting the job landscape was also prevalent across Glassdoor's community, the company's survey shows. Mentions of the term \"agentic\" \u2014 a reference to the AI bots businesses are implementing across retail, travel and many other industry sectors \u2014 soared more than 2,200% from a year ago, as workers scrambled to learn how to use new AI tools.",
      "Political conversations also infiltrated the workplace, with mentions of \"inauguration\" spiking 875% compared to 2024, according to Glassdoor.",

      "Canada has launched a $1.2 billion initiative aimed at drawing leading researchers to the country, as the U.S. intensifies restrictions on highly skilled workers by charging $100,000 for H-1B visas.",
      "The Canadian government announced on Tuesday that its investment over 12 years will be used to recruit and support over 1,000 individuals advancing world-leading research in critical fields, including doctors and scientists.",
      "\"As other countries constrain academic freedoms and undermine cutting-edge research, Canada is investing in \u2013 and doubling down on \u2013 science,\" Melanie Joly, Canada's industry minister, said in a statement. \"Today's investment is about securing Canada's place at the forefront of discovery and innovation and leveraging our strength in science to support our future well-being and prosperity for generations to come.\"",
      "While the initiative does not explicitly mention the United States, it appears aimed \u2013 at least in part \u2013 at attracting highly skilled workers like those who could hold H-1B visas.",
      "In September, President Trump signed an executive order requiring a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled foreign worker applicants, saying it will spur companies to hire Americans instead of people from overseas.",
      "The fee applies only to new H-1B applicants who live abroad, according to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversees the visa program. More specifically, the $100,000 fee applies to H-1B applications filed on or after Sept. 21 by workers outside the U.S. and who do not currently hold such a visa, USCIS said in October.",
      "While the fee could foster boosted domestic hiring in some industries, other industries could take a hit. The U.S. health care system, for example, which depends on international professionals such as doctors, lab technicians and nurses to fill positions, could become collateral damage.",
      "Canada, meanwhile, faces its own challenges. The country is experiencing a significant shortage of doctors in primary care, leaving millions without a family physician and contributing to longer emergency room waits and poorer health outcomes.",
      "In response, Canadian officials have announced a path to expedited permanent residency for overseas doctors with at least one year of Canadian work experience, aiming to address the critical workforce gap.",
      "\"This dedicated Express Entry category, along with the reserved federal admission spaces for provinces and territories, will help bring in and keep practice-ready doctors, so people across Canada can get the care they need,\" Lena Metlege Diab, Canada's minister of refugees and citizenship, said in a statement Monday.",

The fee is the equivalent of what some rural hospitals would pay two lab techs in a year, said Holzkamm, who is West River's lab manager.",
      "West River could ask the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee. But it's unclear how long the waiver process would take and if the government would grant one. The hospital could continue trying to recruit someone inside the U.S. for the job. Or, Holzkamm said, it could leave the position unfilled, adding to the workload of the current \"skeleton crew.\"",
      "The U.S. health care system depends on foreign-born professionals to fill its ranks of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other health providers, particularly in chronically understaffed facilities in rural America.",
      "But a new presidential proclamation aimed at the tech industry's use of H-1B visas is making it harder for West River and other rural providers to hire those staffers.",
      "\"The health care industry wasn't even considered. They're going to be collateral damage, and to such an extreme degree that it was clearly not thought about at all,\" said Eram Alam, a Harvard associate professor whose new book examines the history of foreign doctors in the U.S.",
      "Elissa Taub, a Memphis, Tennessee-based attorney who assists hospitals with the H-1B application process, has been hearing concerns from her clients.",
      "\"It's not like there's a surplus of American physicians or nurses waiting in the wings to fill in those positions,\" she said.",
      "Until recently, West River and other employers paid up to $5,000 each time they applied to sponsor an H-1B worker. The visas are reserved for highly skilled foreign workers.",
      "The new $100,000 fee \u2014 part of a\u00a0September proclamation\u00a0by President Trump \u2014 applies to workers living outside the U.S. but not those who were already in the U.S. on a visa.",
      "West River lab tech Kathrine Abelita is one of nine employees \u2014 six technicians and three nurses \u2014 at the hospital who are current or former H-1B visa holders. Abelita is from the Philippines and has worked at West River since 2018. She's now a permanent U.S. resident.",
      "\"It's going to be a big problem for rural health care,\" she said of the new fee. She said most younger American workers want to live in urban areas.",
      "Sixteen percent of registered nurses, 14% of physician assistants, and 14% of nurse practitioners and midwives who work in U.S. hospitals are immigrants, according to a\u00a02023 government survey. Nearly a quarter of physicians in the U.S. went to medical school outside the U.S. or Canada, according to\u00a02024 licensing data.",
      "The\u00a0American Hospital Association, two\u00a0national rural health organizations, and\u00a0more than 50 medical societies\u00a0have asked the administration to give the health care industry exemptions from the new fee. The new cost will disproportionally harm rural communities that already struggle to afford and recruit enough providers, the groups argue.",
      "\"A blanket exception for healthcare providers is the simplest path forward,\" the National Rural Health Association and National Association of Rural Health Clinics wrote in a joint letter.",
      "The proclamation allows fee exemptions for individuals, workers at specific companies, and those in entire industries when \"in the national interest.\"\u00a0New guidance\u00a0says the fee will be waived only in an \"extraordinarily rare circumstance.\" That includes showing that there is \"no American worker\" available for the position and that requiring a company to spend $100,000 would \"significantly undermine\" U.S. interests.",
      "Taub called those standards \"exceptionally high.\"",
      "Representatives of the NRHA and the American Medical Association, which organized a letter from the medical societies, said they've received no response after sending requests to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in late September and early October. The AHA declined to say whether it had heard back.",
      "Homeland Security officials directed KFF Health News' inquiries to the White House, which did not answer questions about individual waiver timelines or the possibility of a categorical exemption for the health care industry.",
      "Instead, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers sent a statement defending the new fee, saying it will \"put American workers first.\" Her comments echo Mr. Trump's proclamation, which focuses on accusations that the tech industry is abusing the H-1B program by replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign ones. But the order applies to all trades.",
      "Alam, the Harvard professor, said the U.S.' reliance on international providers does raise legitimate concerns, such as about how it takes professionals away from lower-income countries facing even greater health concerns and staffing shortages than the U.S.",
      "This decades-long dependency, she said, stems from population booms, medical schools' historical exclusion of nonwhite men, and the \"much, much cheaper\" cost of importing providers trained abroad than expanding health education in the U.S.",
      "Internationally trained doctors tend to work in rural and urban areas that are poor and underserved, according to\u00a0a survey\u00a0and\u00a0research review.",
      "Nearly 1,000 H-1B providers were employed in rural areas this year, the two rural health organizations wrote in their letter to the Trump administration.",
      "J-1 visas, the most common type held by foreign doctors during their residencies and other postgraduate training in the U.S., require them to return to their home country for two years before applying for an H-1B.",
      "But a government program called the Conrad 30 Waiver Program allows up to 1,500 J-1 holders a year to remain in the U.S. and apply for an H-1B in exchange for working for three years in a provider shortage area, which includes many rural communities.",
      "President Trump's proclamation says employers that sponsor H-1B workers already inside the U.S., such as doctors with these waivers, won't have to pay the six-figure fee, a nuance clarified in guidance released about a month later.",
      "But employers will have to pay the new fee when hiring doctors and others who apply while living outside the U.S.",
      "Alyson Kornele, CEO of West River Health Services, said most of the foreign nurses and lab techs it hires are outside the U.S. when they apply.",
      "Ivan Mitchell, CEO of Great Plains Health in North Platte, Nebraska, said most of his hospital's H-1B physicians were inside the U.S. on other visas when they applied. But he said physical therapists, nurses, and lab techs typically apply from abroad.",
      "Holzkamm said it took five to eight months to hire H-1B applicants at her lab before the new fee was introduced.",
      "Bobby Mukkamala, a surgeon and the president of the American Medical Association, said Republican and Democratic lawmakers are concerned about the ramifications for rural health care.",
      "They include Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said he planned to reach out about possible exemptions.",
      "\"We want to make it easier, not harder, and less expensive, not more expensive, for people who need the workforce,\" the Republican told KFF Health News in September.",
      "Thune's office did not respond to questions about whether the senator has heard from the administration regarding potential waivers for health workers.",
      "The Trump administration is facing at least two lawsuits attempting to block the new fee.\u00a0One group of plaintiffs\u00a0includes a company that recruits foreign nurses and a union that represents medical graduates.\u00a0Another lawsuit, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, mentions concerns about the physician shortage and health systems' ability to afford the new fee.",
      "Kornele said West River won't be able to afford a $100,000 fee so it's doubling down on local recruiting and retention.",
      "But Holzkamm said she hasn't been successful in finding lab techs from North Dakota colleges, even those who intern at the hospital. She said West River can't compete with the salaries offered in bigger cities.",

    "summary": "Homeownership can feel like a luxury when only a sliver of the country's housing market is affordable for most Americans, Bankrate analyst says.",
    "story": [
      "Homeownership is increasingly out of reach for most U.S. families as the gap between people's earnings and home prices\u00a0widens, according to a new analysis.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a\u00a0report. The personal finance firm defines a home as affordable if the annual housing costs do not exceed 30% of a household's income.",
      "\"Only a sliver of the housing market is affordable to the typical household,\" Bankrate data analyst Alex Gailey told CBS News. \"That's when homeownership starts to feel less like a common middle-class milestone and more like a luxury.\"",
      "Experts emphasize that the ability to buy a home, long viewed as a pillar of the American Dream, is critical for building wealth. But high home prices, driven in part by a nationwide shortage of affordable housing, have made that difficult for many Americans.",
      "\"It's left the average American household with far fewer homes than they can afford, and we haven't been building at the rate we should be,\" Gailey said.",
      "Figures from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of housing sales last year were by first-time homebuyers \u2014 down from 50% in 2010. The U.S. needs 4.7 million housing units to keep up with demand, according to a July analysis from Zillow, an online real estate marketplace.",
      "In 2024 (the latest date for which figures are available), the median household income in the U.S. after adjusting for inflation was nearly $84,000, according to Census data. That is far less than the $113,000 in annual income needed to buy a typical home, which now costs around $435,000, according to Bankrate.",
      "In the country's priciest cities, such as New York, San Francisco and Seattle, households must earn at least $200,000 a year to afford the median-priced home.",
      "As of 2025, about 65% of U.S. households owned their own home, down from a peak of more than 69% in 2004, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "By contrast, in some parts of the South and West, where home construction has picked up in some markets, there are glimmers of hope, Gailey said, pointing to stronger tax incentives and looser permitting requirements as policies that could boost construction.",
      "\"Those regions have brighter outlooks than the Northeast and Midwest, where building has lagged, and inventory levels remain well below pre-pandemic norms,\" she said.",
      "Aspiring homebuyers could see some relief in 2026. Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from the 6.6% average in 2025, according to Realtor.com.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 20:50:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump spoke about affordability and his economic agenda in the Poconos, in northeastern Pennsylvania, Tuesday night.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 After weeks of decrying the focus on \"affordability\" and calling it a \"Democratic hoax,\" President Trump spoke in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night to sell his economic agenda ahead of a challenging midterm election season for congressional Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump spent much of the more than 90-minute-long rally-style speech promoting and defending his economic record, saying,\u00a0\"America is winning again\" and \"Pennsylvania is prospering again.\" He touted job growth in the key battleground state, which has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the nation as a whole, and a decline in gas prices. The president also claimed his tariffs on foreign goods are paying dividends for the U.S. economy \u2014 despite worries from most economists that tariffs can lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices.",
      "He pointed to the tax components of his \"big, beautiful bill,\" including a plan to create\u00a0investment accounts for children \u2014 seeded with $1,000 from the federal government for eligible kids \u2014 and a tax deduction for tips.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted his decision to let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, a major employer in Pennsylvania. He said his administration \"saved\" the company, which he said is now \"hot as a pistol.\"",
      "\"The one thing you need, you need steel,\" he said. \"You know, you can give up certain products. You can give up pencils... You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls.\"",
      "He argued his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and said \"prices are coming down.\" Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in September, which is well below 2022 levels \u2014 when inflation hit 9.1% \u2014 but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Mr. Trump also continued blaming Democrats for affordability issues.",
      "\"They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,\" the president said.",
      "After initially focusing on cost-of-living issues, Mr. Trump veered off topic at times, riffing about immigration and polling members of the audience about whether to refer to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as \"sleepy Joe\" or \"crooked Joe.\"",
      "He also repeatedly brought up a fraud scandal that has enveloped Minnesota politics, and pointed to the fact that most of the defendants are of Somali descent. At several points, he urged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to \"do your job\" as Bessent's agency investigates allegations that Minnesota tax dollars went to the terror group al Shabaab.",
      "Trump addresses affordability after calling issue a \"scam\"",
      "The president has publicly and privately vented about the focus on affordability as an issue for weeks, referring to it as a \"hoax,\" a \"con job\" and a \"scam\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for focusing on affordability issues in Tuesday's speech, though he said: \"I can't call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"",
      "Last week, the president called the affordability issue a \"fake narrative\" made up by Democrats to sway the public. But at the same time, he said he had inherited problems with affordability from his predecessor.",
      "\"They just say the word,\" the president said during his Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. \"It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it \u2014 affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.\"",
      "Inflation has\u00a0edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, but the latest inflation numbers have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting meeting this week \u2014 because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In an interview published Tuesday, the president told Politico\u00a0that \"prices are all coming down.\"",
      "Behind the scenes, aides told CBS News last week that the president has grown increasingly irritated by perceptions that his policies aren't easing prices.",
      "His travel to sell his economic agenda in Pennsylvania is a quiet acknowledgement that he needs to do more to rally the public behind his policies. In Tuesday's speech, Mr. Trump said he decided to speak about affordability in part because chief of staff Susie Wiles told him he needed to start campaigning for the midterm elections.",
      "Polling shows voters are feeling the crunch of still-high prices and the cost of living, as well as the challenging market for job seekers \u2014 and many at least partially blame Mr. Trump.",
      "In a November CBS News/YouGov poll, 60% of respondents agreed Mr. Trump makes prices and inflation \"sound better than they really are.\" Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the president's policies are making grocery prices go up. Just 32% said the U.S. economy is good, down from 38% the month Mr. Trump took office in January. Respondents were most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important to them, and among those who listed the economy and inflation as their top priorities, 77% said the president is not spending enough time on those issues.",
      "The Palm Beach Post, a local paper near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida, published an opinion piece Tuesday with the headline, \"'Affordability' is not a hoax, Trump. Reality costs too much.\"",
      "Pennsylvania will feature key races for Republicans as they try to hold onto their majority in the House of Representatives in 2026. Mount Pocono, where Mr. Trump spoke Tuesday night, is just over 30 miles from Scranton, Biden's hometown.",
      "Cost of living worries still linger",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks come amid ongoing public frustration over the high cost of living in the U.S.",
      "Although U.S. inflation has fallen, the high cost of food, shelter, health care, utilities, child care and other basic necessities has remained a sore spot for millions of Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has vacillated between downplaying complaints about the economy and defending his administration's efforts to address affordability issues.",
      "In November, for example, the Trump administration removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. Mr. Trump last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump on Monday announced $12 billion in aid for farmers who have struggled under tariffs and because of the U.S trade war with China.",
      "\"We're bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. \"You can call it 'affordability' or anything you want, but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we're the ones that are fixing it.\"",
      "The economy has proved resilient this year despite earlier fears about the impact of steep new U.S. tariffs on imports. After losing steam in the first quarter, the nation's gross domestic product has accelerated in the second half of 2025, while the nation's labor market has remained steady despite slowing payroll gains.",
      "Financial markets also continue to hover in record territory, shrugging off concerns about a bubble in AI companies.",
      "At the same time, some experts describe the economy as \"K-shaped\" \u2014 a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder.",
      "Aimee  Picchi, \n                                                  \n                                  Fin  Daniel G\u00f3mez and \n                                                  \n                                  Olivia  Rinaldi\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "The author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott revealed $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits in 2025 Tuesday, marking a significant increase in her annual giving from recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Philanthropist and billionaire MacKenzie Scott announced Tuesday she has given $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits so far in 2025, a major increase over her recent yearly contributions.",
      "Writing in an essay on her website, Scott said, \"This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year.\"",
      "Scott acknowledged donating $2.6 billion in 2024 and $2.1 billion in 2023. The gifts this year bring her total giving since 2019 to $26.3 billion.",
      "Scott's donations have captured the attention of nonprofits and other charitable funders because they come with no strings attached and are often very large compared to the annual budgets of the recipient organizations. Forbes estimates Scott's net worth at $33 billion, most of which comes from Amazon shares she received after her 2019 divorce from company founder Jeff Bezos.",
      "Research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy in February showed that Scott has donated to more than 2,000 nonprofits, and the median size was roughly $5 million.",
      "With the exception of an open call for applications in 2023, it is not possible to apply for her funding nor to reach her directly, as Scott maintains no public-facing office or foundation. Organizations are usually notified through an intermediary that Scott is awarding them a donation with little prelude or warning.",
      "In advance of her announcement on her website, Yield Giving, more than a dozen historically Black colleges and universities revealed they had received $783 million in donations from Scott so far this year, according to research from Marybeth Gasman, a professor at Rutgers University and expert on HBCUs.",
      "\"One of the things that I really admire about Mackenzie Scott is that she is like an equity machine,\" Gasman told the Associated Press, especially at a time when efforts to promote equity in education have come under attack from the Trump administration. She also said Scott's gifts to HBCUs this time are bigger than the round of donations she made in 2020.",
      "Not all of the schools that previously had received funding from Scott received a gift this time and there were some first-time recipients as well. In total, Gasman has tracked $1.35 billion in donations from Scott to HBCUs since 2020.",
      "Scott's recent donations to HBCU's include $50 million to\u00a0Norfolk State University, $63 million to\u00a0Prairie View A&M University\u00a0and $50 million to\u00a0Bowie State University.",
      "On Friday, Scott donated $25 million to Lincoln University of Pennsylvania.",
      "In addition, UNCF, which is the largest provider of scholarships to minority students, received $70 million from Scott, and said it will invest the gift in a collective endowment it is building for participating HBCUs. Another $50 million went to Native Forward Scholars Fund, which had also received a previous gift from Scott and provides college and graduate scholarships to Native American students.",
      "Unlike Scott's gifts, most foundations or major donors direct grants to specific programs and require an application and updates about the impact of the nonprofit's work. Scott does not ask grantees to report back about how they used the money.",
      "In October, Scott posted an essay on her website. The essay, which she expanded upon in December to announce her giving, also reflects on how acts of generosity and kindness can ripple far afield and into the future. She cited her own experiences getting help while in college, including a dentist who repaired a tooth for free and her roommate who loaned her $1,000.",
      "Scott now has invested in that same roommate's company, which offers loans to students who would otherwise struggle to get financing from banks. The investments seem to be part of an effort Scott announced last year to move more of her money into \"mission aligned\" investments, rather than into vehicles that seek only the highest monetary returns.",
      "In her 2025 essay, Scott seemed to urge people toward action, writing, \"There are many ways to influence how we move through the world, and where we land.\"",

    "title": "Why fighting inflation may not be the best way to make life more affordable",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/affordability-wages-inflation-prices-economy-trump-speech/",
    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:44:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Beating back inflation is only half the battle in lowering the cost of living \u2014 you also have to think about people's pay, economists argue.",
    "story": [
      "Mounting public attention on the struggle millions of Americans face affording food, housing and other daily necessities has largely centered on what can be done to quash inflation. Yet some economists say the discussion is incomplete without addressing another major reason life has become unaffordable for so many people: their\u00a0meager paychecks.",
      "\"It's not just about how much things cost. Affordability is truly about, 'Does an individual have enough money to buy the things they want?' So it's not about making things cheaper, but making it so you earn more so that the stuff you need is affordable,\" Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday evening is expected to address cost-of-living concerns and other economic issues at a rally in Mount Pocono, Pa. Although he has at times dismissed claims that the U.S. faces an affordability crisis, his administration has also taken steps to offer relief.",
      "In November, for example, Mr. Trump removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. The president last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "\"Your money doesn't go as far\"",
      "To be sure, controlling inflation is critical, as well as an explicit aim under the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to keep both unemployment and prices in check. Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, describes prices and wages as \"two sides of the same coin.\"",
      "\"You can achieve the same standard of living by either raising wages or lowering costs or both,\" he added. \"So it is important to deal with cost-of-living issues if you want to improve living standards, but raising wages also works.\"",
      "Shierholz, who served as chief economist at the Department of Labor under Barack Obama from 2014 to 2017, thinks a better way to make life more affordable is to raise worker wages so their dollars stretch further. She also favors providing government subsidies to help ease the burden of affording essential \u2014 and increasingly costly \u2014 services such as child care and health care.",
      "One-third of middle-class families struggle to afford housing\u00a0and child care, according to a recent\u00a0report from the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans are struggling to afford things beyond the bare essentials, according to the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity. The research firm has found that the bottom 60% of income earners in the U.S. have difficulty affording expenses such as higher education, transportation and even the basic technology required for their jobs.",
      "\"There are some things that feel out of reach that didn't feel like they were out of reach in the past,\" said Veronique de Rugy, an economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \"Your money doesn't go as far as it used to.\"",
      "Why prices may not drop much",
      "Economists note that prices don't generally decline broadly unless the economy is in a recession, with presidential administrations and even the Fed having a limited toolkit for addressing severe bouts of inflation. Meanwhile, a sharp, across-the-board drop in prices can indicate a dangerous erosion in consumer demand, leading to an economic downturn.",
      "\"Overall, it's very rare and not a good thing to have outright deflation across the economy,\" the Cato Institute's Lincicome told CBS News.",
      "Indeed, millions of people would have to lose their jobs, and then cut their spending, for demand to slow enough for companies to broadly reduce their prices, according to Shierholz.",
      "\"In order to bring the overall price level down, you have to have a massive recession because people are not demanding stuff, because they don't have any income,\" she added. \"That's how you get a drop in the overall price level.\"",
      "Affordability fixes?",
      "Shierholz favors a range of policies for driving both short- and long-term wage growth. First and foremost, the U.S. could boost the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "Local governments aren't waiting around for the feds to take action, with dozens of states in recent years adopting higher baseline wages. In 2026,\u00a0minimum wage increases are set to take effect in 19 states and 49 cities and counties starting on Jan. 1, according to the National Employment Law Project.",
      "Reforming labor laws to make it easier for workers to form a union can also lead to higher wages for workers, Shieholz said. Equally important, in her view, is providing a robust social safety net. That includes providing ample unemployment insurance benefits so workers who lose their jobs can stay afloat financially.",
      "\"That actually raises wages because it gives workers power,\" she said. \"By contrast, if your employer knows you'll drop into poverty if you give up or lose your job, you're going to be much less able to make any risky demands.\"",
      "The Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonpartisan group focused on economic equality, also argues in a new report\u00a0that expanding unemployment insurance benefits helps low-income workers find better-paying jobs.",
      "Although surging employee pay can fuel inflation under certain conditions, De Rugy of the Mercatus Center said that rising wages rooted in strong economic growth \"actually improves affordability, because it tends to shift the bargaining power toward employees.\"",
      "To ease housing costs, progressive economists also support policies like freezing the rent and offering financial incentives to homebuilders to put up more affordable housing.",
      "Other experts also underline the importance of providing low-cost child care as a key part of solving the affordability puzzle for U.S. families.\u00a0Child care costs today exceed\u00a0the cost of rent in dozens of cities, according to a recent LendingTree analysis. Households spend an average of $1,282 per month for full-time child care for one child and $2,252 for two kids, the lending marketplace found.",
      "Some states are leading the way to ease child care costs, showing that progress is possible given sufficient political will. In November,\u00a0New Mexico became the first U.S. state to offer free universal child care to residents, with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham telling CBS News it would save families an average of $12,000 a year.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:53:08 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve will announce if they will cut rates again in December's meeting \u2014 their last meeting of 2025. The decision will determine whether borrowers get more relief on interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve will announce whether to cut interest rates at its December meeting, capping off a turbulent year for the U.S. economy defined by fresh labor market headwinds and tariff-fueled inflation that has deepened the nation's affordability crunch.",
      "The U.S. central bank will have to make its decision without some key government data. Hiring data for November and the latest inflation number have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Fed's meeting \u2014 because of the U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "Those two measures are key to the Fed's decision-making on interest rates because of its so-called dual mandate, which is to keep both inflation and unemployment low. Those goals have proved difficult to reconcile this year amid a slowdown in hiring and a spike in layoffs, while inflation has edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Economists expect another quarter-point cut",
      "Despite the conflicting data, most economists are penciling in an interest-rate cut at the December 10 meeting.",
      "CME FedWatch, which assesses the probability of rate moves based on futures pricing data, puts the odds of another 0.25 percentage-point cut in the Fed's benchmark rate at 88%. That would represent the third straight Fed cut and lower the federal funds rate, or what banks charge each other for short-term loans, to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.",
      "A rate cut this week could help some borrowers by reducing the cost of their loans, from credit card APRs to home equity lines of credit. That could bolster U.S. households at a time when many Americans report still feeling pinched by the rising cost of food, health care and other everyday expenses.",
      "\"Another Fed rate cut to close an unnervingly uncertain year is good news for borrowers,\" LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz told CBS News. \"The accumulated savings from the Fed's moves are starting to add up to real money.\"",
      "Credit card rates are now at their lowest since April 2023, and are continuing to fall, Schulz added. Another rate cut on Dec. 10 would mark the sixth reduction since September 2024, with those cuts amounting to hundreds of dollars in savings for many borrowers, he added.",
      "Although official economic data has been delayed, Fed officials will be looking at other data sources, such as the ADP National Employment Report, which tracks private payrolls. Its November data shows employers shed 32,000 jobs, a signal the labor market is continuing to face headwinds.",
      "\"The absence of recent inflation data leaves the Federal Reserve operating with limited visibility, while alternative labor indicators and political pressure are steering the committee toward a more accommodative policy stance,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email.",
      "President Trump and other administration officials have chastised Fed Chair Jerome Powell this year about not moving sooner to ratchet back interest rates.",
      "Another Fed rate cut carries its own risks. Lowering borrowing costs can spur consumers and businesses to spend more, potentially fueling higher inflation, Kates noted.",
      "A Fed divided",
      "Although economists expect the Fed to approve a rate cut on Wednesday, not all members of the Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 the central bank's 12-member rate-setting panel \u2014 are expected to support the move.",
      "Several FOMC members have recently spoken publicly in support of cutting rates, including Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John Williams, who last month said the labor market's weakness outweighs concerns about inflation. In October, however, Powell\u00a0cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "\"It's difficult to recall a time when the Federal Open Market Committee has been so evenly divided about the need for additional rate cuts than the upcoming December meeting,\" Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"It's a close call, but on balance we expect the committee to vote to lower rates\" by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Are more rate cuts coming in 2026?",
      "For consumers, businesses and investors, perhaps the biggest question on Wednesday is whether policymakers will hint at more rate cuts for 2026.",
      "For now, economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting on Jan. 27-28, according to a poll by FactSet. The survey of economists shows a 62% probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged next month.",
      "Even so, economists are generally forecasting more rate cuts for 2026, although the timing remains uncertain. The Fed could wait until March to make its first cut of the year because inflation remains above its 2% annual target, according to Maxime Darmet, senior economist at Allianz Trade.",
      "But the labor market remains a wild card, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research report. Employers have cut more than 1.1 million jobs through November, the most since 2020 and a 54% increase from the same period a year ago, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Employers are relying more on artificial intelligence, with some companies\u00a0saying they're cutting jobs as AI makes their workforce more efficient. A continuation of that trend could lead to weaker hiring or even a spike in layoffs in 2026, supporting the argument for more rate cuts next year, Goldman said.",
      "\"[W]e see this as the greatest uncertainty and the most important question for 2026: Will somewhat firmer growth really be enough to stabilize a labor market where job growth outside of health care has been running negative recently and companies are increasingly focused on using AI to cut labor costs?\" Goldman analysts wrote.",

    "summary": "Shoppers may be unaware they're paying as much as 23% more than others for the same grocery items on Instacart, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart customers may be surprised to discover they are unwittingly paying more for the same items sold by some of America's major retail chains than their fellow shoppers.",
      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",
      "Variations in pricing for identical products are particularly acute in online shopping, given that customers don't have the same reference points as in physical stores, said Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData.",
      "\"You sit in front of your phone or your browser, you're shown the price, and you don't know what everyone else was shown,\" he said.",
      "Justin Brookman, director of digital marketplace policy for Consumer Reports, agreed. \"Traditionally, we haven't had to worry about this sort of thing. We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",
      "Safeway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Instacart told CBS News in a statement that 10 of its retailer partners are using pricing experiments, but did not specify which ones.",
      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "The rise of AI pricing models",
      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",
      "As pricing models like Instacart's become more sophisticated, Brookman said he's concerned about what it could mean for consumers.",
      "\"I'm worried companies are going to use these sorts of algorithmic pricing models to charge us the maximum amount we're willing to pay, which is good for their profits, but not so good for [our wallets],\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Nancy Hunt arrived at an emergency room from a Genesis HealthCare nursing home in Pennsylvania in such dreadful shape, including maggots infesting her gangrened foot, that the hospital called an elder abuse hotline and then the police, her son alleged in a lawsuit.",
      "Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a \"significant\" factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt's son signed in August 2024.",
      "Yet Genesis hasn't paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.",
      "Once the nation's largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.",
      "The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.",
      "When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.",
      "As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.",
      "\"It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,\" said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico \u2014 an injury the medical examiner's report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt's family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.",
      "Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained \"focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption\" during bankruptcy.",
      "One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident's behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer's patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.",
      "Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company's owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis' new ownership and other companies they blame for the company's collapse.",
      "John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, \"They never had any intention to honor these deals.\"",
      "Low ratings and fines",
      "During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.",
      "In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.",
      "In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.",
      "The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.",
      "Dangers in memory care",
      "Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.",
      "Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer's in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded \"shut up bitch I know you like this,\" according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.",
      "Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident's behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, \"I want to have sex with you.\" When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, \"Shhh.\"",
      "The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. \"don't sing anymore.\"",
      "Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn't provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.' lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.",
      "\"We just felt we have to hold them accountable,\" R.S.' daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. \"Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?\"",
      "Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family's claim filing.",
      "Growth and debt",
      "Genesis' downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.",
      "In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis' bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.",
      "Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis' bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and \"mired in corporate inefficiencies.\" Robichaux wrote that Genesis' financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the COVID pandemic.",
      "Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux's filing.",
      "But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised \"substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\"",
      "In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee's Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and \"siphon value to himself.\" The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while \"staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.\" Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Drawn-out lawsuits",
      "Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson's lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.",
      "After the judge rejected Genesis' request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2\u00bd years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.",
      "This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.",
      "\"It was so drawn out and for so long,\" Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis' bankruptcy \"despicable.\"",
      "Payouts postponed",
      "Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson's, said the company frequently filed appeals. \"They did not usually win them on these issues,\" she said, \"and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.\"",
      "Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote's law partner. \"The payments wouldn't start for several months out,\" Harvey said. Foote said Genesis' lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.",
      "Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis' settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.",
      "Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.",
      "A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy \u2014 21 months after the case was resolved \u2014 it still owed $100,000, according to the family's claim.",
      "\"We never found out the truth\"",
      "Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.",
      "\"It looked like she was hit by a truck,\" Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. \"I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.\"",
      "The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson's jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.",
      "\"We never found out the truth,\" Harley said. \"They wanted to settle out of court.\"",
      "The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson's five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.",
      "\"If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,\" Harley said.",
      "Maddening judges",
      "By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.",
      "Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate's lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown's estate or explain the delay.",
      "Genesis \"obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,\" McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. \"They assure me that they're not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven't lived up to what the bargain was.\"",
      "Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.",
      "In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.",
      "In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing \"unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.\" Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.",
      "Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt's claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt's lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.",
      "Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.",
      "\"Bankruptcy as a tool\"",
      "In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.",
      "Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.",
      "\"Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,\" Rafatjoo said. \"A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.\"",
      "On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau's favor despite an \"objectively better and higher competing bid\" from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau's group had increased its bid during the auction.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee's Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that \"individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.\" Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.",
      "\"They can file bankruptcy again,\" said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. \"And we're the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday announced a $12 billion aid package for American farmers, moving to support a sector that's been hurt by tariffs and a U.S. trade war with China.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the plan during a White House event attended by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, several lawmakers and members of the farming community.",
      "Mr. Trump said the money to fund the aid package would come from government revenue raised through U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"This relief will provide much-needed certainty to farmers as they get this year's harvest to market and look ahead to next year's crops, and it'll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families,\" he said in announcing the financial assistance.",
      "Rollins said farmers can apply for the funding in the coming weeks and that it will be disbursed by Feb. 28, 2026.",
      "Trade war hit",
      "Roughly $11 billion of the government assistance is set aside for the Department of Agriculture's Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which the White House has said will offer one-time payments to farmers for row crops.",
      "\"You've got to start financing for planning next year when things will be very good,\" Bessent\u00a0told \"Face the Nation\"\u00a0moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday.",
      "Rep. Glenn \"GT\" Thompson, the chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, commended the aid package.",
      "\"The critical assistance announced today will help farmers obtain financing for 2026 and serve as a bridge to the long-term improvements to the farm safety net, which were included in the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said in a statement.",
      "American farmers have already lost billions of dollars in soybean sales this year after China halted purchases in May in retaliation for the Trump administration's tariffs. American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall estimates farmers' total losses will reach $34 billion amid broader economic headwinds.",
      "\"[Farmers] face the same high prices as all of America's families, as more of their income is going to household bills and higher operating costs, including loans, equipment and supplies,\" he said in a statement. \"At the same time, farmers are receiving historically low prices for most major crops.\"",
      "China is the largest importer of U.S. soybeans, purchasing more than half of all American exports of the crop in the last five years, according to the Iowa Farm Bureau, a farmer advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a preliminary\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0in October, which the White House said involved the resumption of U.S. soybean sales to China. The White House said\u00a0in November that China would purchase at least 12 million metric tons of soybeans in the last two months of 2025.",
      "However, Chinese imports of U.S. soybeans could fall short of what the country normally purchases, CBS News correspondent Lana Zak\u00a0reported in November.",
      "The trade war with China dealt a double whammy to U.S farmers, who were already facing high input costs and weak profit margins. Farmers recently\u00a0told 60 Minutes\u00a0they are suffering major losses on corn, soybeans and cotton. Prices of the crops have fallen in the last two years, according to data from the American Farm Bureau Federation, an advocacy organization.",
      "Bessent said on Face the Nation on Sunday that domestic soybean prices have risen as much as 15% since the agreement with the Chinese.",
      "The Trump administration started considering\u00a0a financial aid package for farmers\u00a0in October, with sources telling CBS News that it could include more than $10 billion in relief.

Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros.

      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",
      "The offer is backed by the Ellison family \u2014 Paramount CEO David Ellison's father is Larry Ellison, who leads software maker Oracle Corp. and is the second-richest person with a net worth of $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2014 as well as investment firm RedBird Capital.",
      "Paramount Skydance's bid also includes several outside financing partners, according to a Paramount Skydance regulatory filing. They include Affinity Partners, the private equity firm run by Jared Kushner, a son-in-law of President Trump, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.",
      "The outside investment firms have agreed to give up any governance rights, including seats on the board of directors of a combined firm, according to the regulatory filing.",
      "Potential antitrust \u2014 and political \u2014 hurdles",
      "Some Wall Street analysts have said the Netflix-Warner Bros. combination could raise concerns among U.S. antitrust enforcers because of the streaming service's size and the potential to reduce competition in the media space.",
      "\"Because Netflix is positioned as the largest streaming platform, the company's acquisition of HBO Max services and customers raises red flags,\" said Jeffrey May, managing editor for the Insights & Enrichment team within Wolters Kluwer Legal and Regulatory U.S., in an email.",
      "May added, \"Netflix and HBO Max compete for subscribers. Their combination could be seen as a threat to competition and innovation.\"",
      "President Trump also signaled the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal could face hurdles, saying on Sunday that the combined company's size \"could be a problem.\" Mr. Trump also said he would be involved in any decision about whether the federal government should approve the deal.",
      "Usha Haley, a Wichita State University professor who specializes in international business strategy, told the Associated Press that Paramount's ties to Mr. Trump are notable. Larry Ellison is an avowed supporter of Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump \"said he's going to be involved in the decision \u2014 we should take him at face value,\" Haley said. \"For him, it's just greater control over the media.\"",
      "Netflix declined to comment, while Warner Bros. Discovery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a presentation at the UBS Global Media and Communications conference on Monday, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said they were confident their deal with Warner Bros. would close. Sarandos also said Netflix is committed to creating U.S. jobs.",
      "Blair Levin, a media and telecommunications industry analyst with investment adviser New Street Research, said Mr. Trump's involvement in the battle for Warner Bros. could backfire for Paramount Skydance.",
      "\"If Trump weighs in publicly against the deal, [Netflix] could argue that he did so for political or personal reasons rather than antitrust reasons and seek evidence, including discovery and depositions, leading to all kinds of delays and other potential collateral damage to the government case,\" he said in a note to investors.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",
      "Paramount Skydance's tender offer is set to expire on Jan. 8, 2026, unless it is extended.",
      "Impact on streaming",
      "Netflix, which has more than 300 million subscribers, is the world's largest streaming service, according to David R. King, a professor of management at Florida State University.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming platforms, which include HBO Max and Discovery+, rank as the fourth-largest with 128 million subscribers, followed by Paramount+ at No. 5, with 78 million customers, he added. Amazon Prime Video and Disney/Hulu rank as No. 2 and 3, respectively.",
      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. In a statement on Friday, Warren said the combination would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "Netflix is likely to argue that other video platforms, such as YouTube should be included in calculating streaming services' market share,\u00a0according to The Guardian.",
      "The bidding war follows Warner Bros. Discovery's announcement in June that it planned to split into two businesses, separating its cable networks from its streaming and studios business.",
      "But in October, the media conglomerate said it had attracted interest\u00a0from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast, were pursuing a deal.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders \"will have to choose between [Paramount Skydance's] straight $30-a-share cash offer and Netflix's slightly lower, more complex bid with a linear networks spin-off, both carrying serious antitrust questions,\" David O'Hara, managing director at market research firm MKI Global Partners, said in an email.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 03:05:37 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia's immediate release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to his Maryland home Thursday night, after a judge ordered the immediate release of the\u00a0Salvadoran national who was mistakenly deported to his home country earlier this year.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told CBS News on Thursday that he was officially out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in Pennsylvania. Hours later, he was spotted arriving at his home in Maryland.",
      "Abrego Garcia has been instructed to check in at an ICE field office in Baltimore at 8 a.m. Friday, his legal team told CBS News. When he was given similar instructions over the summer, following his release from pretrial detention, he was taken into ICE custody, and there are concerns he could be rearrested Friday on different legal grounds.",
      "Earlier Thursday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted Abrego Garcia's habeas corpus petition seeking release from custody. It's a significant victory for Abrego Garcia, whose immigration case became a major flashpoint in President Trump's mass-deportation campaign when he was removed to El Salvador earlier this year. An earlier order had prohibited the U.S. from removing him to his native country because of possible persecution by local gangs.",
      "Xinis, in her order, found that there was no final order of removal from the government to deport Abrego Garcia from the United States, despite the Trump administration's repeated attempts to remove him.",
      "\"Because respondents have no statutory authority to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country absent a removal order, his removal cannot be considered reasonably foreseeable, imminent, or consistent with due process,\" Xinis wrote in Thursday's order.",
      "\"Although respondents may eventually get it right, they have not as of today,\" the judge continued. \"Thus, Abrego Garcia's detention for the stated purpose of third country removal cannot continue. Respondents' conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer.\"",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the judge's decision \"naked judicial activism by an Obama-appointed judge.\"",
      "\"This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "The Trump administration has been attempting to re-deport Abrego Garcia to the African nations of Uganda, Eswatini or Ghana, but none of the countries have agreed to accept him.",
      "In October, however, the administration informed the court that Liberia had agreed to take Abrego Garcia and was making \"final necessary arrangements\" for his deportation there.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenbergsaid at the time that unless Liberia guaranteed it would not send Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, deporting him to the West African nation \"is no less unlawful than sending him directly\" to his home country again.",
      "In November, the Trump administration argued that Abrego Garcia had received significant due process in the U.S. In a court filing, the Justice Department said a U.S. government asylum officer had interviewed Abrego Garcia, who has been in federal immigration detention since late August, and determined he had failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia.",
      "Xinis heard testimony in October from John Schultz, an ICE official, about the Trump administration's efforts to remove Abrego Garcia. Schultz said the administration remains in active discussions with Eswatini about removing him there, though the east African country rejected a request to take him.",
      "Schultz said that once the administration has been informed that a third country is willing to accept Abrego Garcia, it could deport him within 72 hours if allowed by the court.",
      "Abrego Garcia has said he is willing to go to Costa Rica and designated the country as his preferred country of removal, and Costa Rica has indicated it would provide him refugee status or residency. But during the hearing Oct. 10, a Justice Department lawyer said there had not been discussions about deporting him there.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia accused the Trump administration of gamesmanship and deliberately seeking to remove him to countries where he could raise claims of reasonable fear of persecution, with the goal of keeping him detained for longer.",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. from El Salvador in 2011 and has lived in Maryland with his wife and children. But he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and deported there, though he'd been granted the legal status in 2019 that should have prevented his removal to that country.",
      "As part of a civil case Abrego Garcia and his wife brought against the Trump administration, Xinis ordered DHS to facilitate his return to the U.S. But immigration officials resisted doing so for months. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. in June, but only after a federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted him on two charges of human smuggling, stemming from a November 2022 traffic stop.",
      "Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty, and a judge in Tennessee ordered him to be released on bail ahead of a criminal trial set to begin in January. But he remained in criminal confinement for several more weeks because of concerns from his lawyers that immigration authorities would arrest him upon his release and deport him from the U.S.",
      "He was released from jail in Tennessee in August and returned to Maryland. But days later, he was taken into custody by immigration authorities after being summoned for an interview at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore. The Trump administration notified Abrego Garcia's lawyers he could be deported to Uganda, though Abrego Garcia expressed fear of persecution and torture, as well as a concern that the Ugandan government would send him back to El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia also filed a new legal challenge to his confinement and the Trump administration's efforts to deport him for a second time, which Xinis is presiding over. She has blocked immigration officials from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S., and he had since remained in detention at a facility in Pennsylvania.",
      "At the heart of Abrego Garcia's challenge is a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which the high court said the government cannot indefinitely detain a person in the U.S. illegally if there is no significant likelihood of removal in the \"reasonably foreseeable future.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that he has been in near-continuous confinement since March, when he was deported to El Salvador and held in prisons there. His only period of freedom was for a weekend in August, in between his release from criminal custody in Tennessee and his arrest by immigration authorities in Maryland.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he is granting a pardon to Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who was convicted of allowing unauthorized access to voting machines \u2014 even though the pardon power is widely understood to only apply to federal crimes.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday evening he is granting a pardon to Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who is serving a nine-year state sentence\u00a0for allowing unauthorized access to voting machines \u2014 even though the president's pardon power is widely understood to only apply to federal crimes.",
      "\"Democrats have been relentless in their targeting of TINA PETERS, a Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest,\" the president claimed on Truth Social, though Peters was prosecuted by an elected Republican district attorney. \"Tina is sitting in a Colorado prison for the 'crime' of demanding Honest Elections.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed Peters was trying to \"expose Voter Fraud\" in 2020. The president has long insisted, without evidence, that he lost the 2020 race due to fraud, claims that were promoted by Peters, a onetime candidate for Colorado secretary of state.",
      "Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement Thursday that \"Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers for state crimes in a state Court. Trump has no constitutional authority to pardon her. His assault is not just on our democracy, but on states' rights and the American constitution.\"",
      "\"One of the most basic principles of our constitution is that states have independent sovereignty and manage our own criminal justice systems without interference from the federal government,\" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a separate statement. \"The idea that a president could pardon someone tried and convicted in state court has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up.\"",
      "A former Mesa County clerk, Peters was convicted in state court last year on seven charges, including three counts of attempting to influence a public servant and one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation. She was sentenced\u00a0in October 2024.",
      "Prosecutors have alleged that in 2021, Peters and others \"devised and executed a deceptive scheme\" to cause an unauthorized person to access Mesa County voting machines. Images from the county's voting equipment later showed up online. Prosecutors said that Peters \u2014 who was aligned with national figures who have falsely claimed that voting machines were rigged in 2020 \u2014 became \"fixated\" on alleged voting problems.",
      "At a sentencing hearing late last year, Judge Matthew Barrett called Peters a \"charlatan\" and \"as defiant as a defendant as this court has ever seen.\" Peters has denied wrongdoing, and she insisted before her sentencing that she had \"never done anything with malice to break the law.\"",
      "Earlier this week, a federal magistrate judge rejected Peters' request to be released while she appeals her conviction.",
      "\"Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers, prosecuted by a Republican District Attorney and in a Republican county of Colorado and found guilty of violating Colorado state laws including criminal impersonation,\" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement Thursday. \"No President has jurisdiction over state law nor the power to pardon a person for state convictions. This is a matter for the courts to decide, and we will abide by court orders.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken an interest in Peters' case, warning in August that he would take \"harsh measures\" if she wasn't let out of state custody. The Federal Bureau of Prisons asked the state of Colorado last month to transfer her to federal custody, drawing pushback from state officials and calls for Polis to deny the request.",
      "Meanwhile, an attorney representing Peters argued in a letter\u00a0last week that Mr. Trump may have the power to pardon the former Mesa County clerk.",
      "Under the Constitution, the president's pardon power applies to \"Offences against the United States,\" which is almost universally understood not to include state crimes. But Peters' lawyer, Peter Ticktin, laid out a theory that the power could extend to the states. Ticktin acknowledged that the issue \"has never been raised in any court.\"",
      "In a statement late Thursday, Ticktin thanked Mr. Trump and argued that Peters \"needs to be released while the issues are being resolved,\" including while courts weigh whether she should be released due to the president's pardon.",
      "\"I am greatly thankful for President Trump,\" Ticktin said in an email to CBS News. \"He has always been true to his beliefs and continues to fight against injustice. God bless our President.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump has intervened on behalf of others who back his false election fraud claims. Shortly after his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump offered pardons or commutations to everybody convicted in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The president also granted pardons last month to dozens of people accused in state court of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, including \"alternate state electors\" and his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.",

    "summary": "President Trump has signed an executive order to block states from regulating artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at restricting states from crafting their own regulations for artificial intelligence, saying the burgeoning industry is at risk of being stifled by a patchwork of onerous rules while in a battle with Chinese competitors for supremacy.",
      "Members of Congress from both parties, as well as civil liberties and consumer rights groups, have pushed for more regulations on AI, saying there is not enough oversight for the powerful technology.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that \"there's only going to be one winner\" as nations race to dominate artificial intelligence, and China's central government gives its companies a single place to go for government approvals.",
      "\"We have the big investment coming, but if they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you can forget it because it's impossible to do,\" the president said.",
      "The executive order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to create a new task force to challenge state laws, and directs the Department of Commerce to draw up a list of problematic regulations. It also threatens to restrict funding from a broadband deployment program and other grant programs to states with AI laws.",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist who is leading Mr. Trump's policies on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, said Thursday the Trump administration would only push back on \"the most onerous examples of state regulation\" but would not oppose \"kid safety\" measures.",
      "Four states \u2014 Colorado, California, Utah and Texas \u2014 have passed laws that set some rules for AI across the private sector, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals.",
      "Those laws include limiting the collection of certain personal information and requiring more transparency from companies.",
      "The laws are in response to AI that already pervades everyday life. The technology helps make consequential decisions for Americans, including who gets a job interview, an apartment lease, a home loan and even certain medical care. But research has shown that it can make mistakes in those decisions, including by prioritizing a particular gender or race.",
      "States' more ambitious AI regulation proposals require private companies to provide transparency and assess the possible risks of discrimination from their AI programs.",
      "Beyond those more sweeping rules, many states have regulated parts of AI: barring the use of deepfakes in elections and to create nonconsensual porn, for example, or putting rules in place around the government's own use of AI.",
      "Those who support regulations that would prevent states from restricting AI\u00a0\u2014 including some GOP lawmakers and advocates like Sacks \u2014 argue that forcing tech companies to contend with varied or even contradictory rules would hurt the industry.",
      "\"At best, we'll end up with 50 different AI models for 50 different states \u2013 a regulatory morass worse than Europe,\" Sacks wrote on X\u00a0earlier this week. \"This will stymie innovation, especially by small startups who can't afford the compliance burden. Meanwhile, China will race ahead.\"",
      "But members of both parties have pushed back. Last month, when congressional Republicans weighed adding restrictions on state AI regulations to a defense bill, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis called the idea a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"",
      "\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,\" the governor wrote.",
      "Earlier this week, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Mr. Trump's plan to restrict AI regulations via an executive order an \"early Christmas present for his CEO billionaire buddies.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. seized a 20-year-old oil tanker called The Skipper off the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday, three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News, after months of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The seizure was initially announced by President Trump during an unrelated White House event on Wednesday. Here's what we know about the boat and the operation:",
      "Seizure involved special operations forces and 2 helicopters",
      "The operation to seize the tanker began Wednesday morning, after the boat had just left port in Venezuela, according to a senior military official and a source familiar with the operation.",
      "The mission was launched from the USS Gerald R. Ford, an aircraft carrier that has been in the area for weeks as part of a broader buildup of U.S. forces in the region, the sources told CBS News.",
      "It involved two helicopters, special operations forces, 10 members of the U.S. Coast Guard and 10 Marines, the sources said. The boarding team was composed of the Coast Guard's Maritime Security and Response Team, an elite maritime interdiction unit based in Chesapeake, Virginia.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a 45-second video of the operation on X, showing armed personnel descending onto the vessel's deck from a helicopter. She said the U.S. executed a seizure warrant on the vessel, and that the tanker was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.\"",
      "While the U.S. government \u2014 particularly the Justice Department and Homeland Security Investigations \u2014 has seized sanctioned oil tankers before, conducting a fast-rope boarding from helicopters at sea is rare, though it's something the boarding team trains for, U.S. officials said.",
      "The operation was led by the Coast Guard, supported by Navy forces, the officials told CBS News. Any such operation would legally require the Coast Guard to be the lead agency because the authorities used for these seizures fall under Coast Guard jurisdiction.",
      "What's happening to the vessel and its oil after the seizure",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday that the vessel is \"currently undergoing a forfeiture process right now.\"",
      "\"The United States currently has a full investigative team on the ground, on the vessel, and individuals on board the vessel are being interviewed and any relevant evidence is being seized,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt said the vessel will go to a U.S. port.",
      "\"The United States does intend to seize the oil,\" she continued. \"However, there is a legal process for the seizure of that oil, and that legal process will be followed.\"",
      "Tanker was sanctioned by Treasury 3 years ago",
      "The Skipper was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group backed by Iran.",
      "The ship \u2014 known as Adisa in 2022 \u2014 is among the vessels controlled by sanctioned Russian oil magnate Viktor Artemov, the Treasury said in a statement. At the time, the Treasury said Artemov transported Iranian oil using an expansive network of ships that were often registered in obscure ways with the intention of skirting U.S. restrictions on Iranian petroleum exports.",
      "The Treasury's 2022 sanctions announcement didn't mention Venezuela. But oil networks involving both Iran and Venezuela have been reported for years, drawing pushback from the United States. The two countries are major petroleum producers with some of the world's largest oil reserves, but trade is restricted by heavy U.S. sanctions.",
      "The tanker is controlled by Nigeria-based management company Thomarose Global Ventures LTD and owned by a firm linked to Artemov, according to publicly available data.",
      "The ship is 20 years old, initially sailing under the name The Toyo in 2005. At 333 meters (about 1,092 feet) in length, it was one of the largest tankers in the world at the time it was built.",
      "The government of Guyana \u2014 which borders Venezuela \u2014 said in a statement Wednesday the ship was falsely flying the Guyanese flag, despite not being registered in the South American country",
      "Bondi said the boat was sanctioned \"due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.\"",
      "\"This seizure, completed off the coast of Venezuela, was conducted safely and securely \u2014 and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues,\" the attorney general said.",
      "Venezuela's government said in a statement that it \"strongly denounces and repudiates what constitutes a shameless robbery and an act of international piracy.\"",

How do you as AG handle that?",

That is my duty, unless they're unconstitutional. Sometimes, there's a rare example; Kamala Harris thought Prop. 8 was unconstitutional, she refused to defend it. But we generally are defending the laws of the State of California. We go through the court process and if a court decides against us and strikes it down, then we will.

Magaziner argued that deporting veterans and their families \"is not what the American people think they signed up for\" when they hear Noem's talking points about hardened criminals.",

Noem repeatedly said that the vetting of the suspect occurred during the Biden administration.",
      "During the questioning, Thompson called the shooting an \"unfortunate accident,\" prompting Noem to fire back that it was \"a terrorist attack.\"",
      "Following the Nov. 26 attack, the Department of Homeland Security halted processing of Afghan visas and froze decisions on asylum applications. The administration has also indefinitely suspended entry for foreign nationals from 19 countries \"of concern\" that were included in President Trump's travel ban.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 17:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Indiana state police said \"numerous\" state lawmakers had faced bomb threats and been the subject of swatting hoaxes amid the push for redistricting.",
    "story": [
      "Indiana Senate Republicans failed to pass a redistricting bill that would have edged out the state's two House Democrats, despite months of pressure from the Trump administration and after state senators faced bomb and swatting threats.",
      "The final vote was 19 senators in favor and 31 against. Republicans have 40 seats in the state Senate to Democrats' 10.",
      "Thursday's failure marks the first time national Republicans' redistricting plans have been thwarted since the push to redraw congressional maps was kicked off by President Trump over the summer.",
      "Republican Gov. Mike Braun, who supported redistricting, posted on social media that he is \"disappointed\" in the result, and said he will be \"working with the President to challenge these people who do not represent the best interests of Hoosiers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has vowed to back primary challenges against Republicans who voted against the Indiana measure, and took aim on Wednesday at Senate president pro tempore Rodric Bray.",
      "\"Anybody that votes against Redistricting, and the SUCCESS of the Republican Party in D.C., will be, I am sure, met with a MAGA Primary in the Spring,\" Mr. Trump posted on social media ahead of the vote. \"Rod Bray and his friends won't be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again.\"",
      "As the state Senate debated the vote, Vice President JD Vance posted on social media that Bray \"consistently told us he wouldn't fight redistricting while simultaneously whipping his members against it. That level of dishonesty cannot be rewarded, and the Indiana GOP needs to choose a side.\"",
      "There were several hours of impassioned debate on Thursday from senators both in favor of and against redistricting.",
      "\"I, like a supermajority of you, do not want to see another Democrat Speaker of the House,\" said Republican state Sen. Spencer Deery, who opposed redistricting. \"But that isn't for me to decide, and it isn't for anyone in this body to decide either. Living in a free constitutional republic means we empower voters to make those decisions.\"",
      "Indiana, which Mr. Trump won last year by 19 points, was among several Republican-led states under pressure from the president and his allies to redraw its maps. Its House delegation is 7-2, with Democrats holding one seat that encompasses Indianapolis and another in the southwestern corner of the state.",
      "In November, Gov. Mike Braun called the legislature to reconvene for a special session to consider redistricting. But Bray insisted that the votes weren't there, and when the legislature convened, state lawmakers simply agreed to meet again in January for the regular session.",
      "Although Republicans hold 40 seats in the state Senate and needed only 25 votes to pass the legislation, Bray expressed doubt that there was enough support to pass the new maps.",
      "After the November session, Mr. Trump stepped up his social media posts about the Indiana vote. State lawmakers began receiving bomb threats and swatting attacks. The Indiana state police said last week that \"numerous\" members of the State Assembly had received bomb threats and were victims of swatting hoaxes. Braun confirmed that he had also received threats.",
      "Indiana's House and Senate GOP leaders announced before Thanksgiving that they would return to vote on redistricting. The measure passed the House, but Bray remained uncertain if it would pass the Senate.",
      "On Monday, the elections committee heard public testimony about the new map. According to The Associated Press, 127 people signed up to testify. Just 18 of them backed the bill, while the rest were opposed.",
      "Republican state Sen. Greg Walker gave an impassioned speech Monday about the threats he had received before voting against advancing the measure.",
      "\"I fear for this institution, I fear for the state of Indiana, and I fear for all states if we allow intimidation and threats to become the norm,\" Walker said.",
      "The nationwide redistricting gambit kicked off over the summer, when Texas' GOP-led legislature reconvened\u00a0to redraw the state's maps to net up to five seats for Republicans. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed forward with a ballot measure known as Proposition 50 to redistrict his state to net up to five seats for Democrats, since California requires voter approval of its congressional map. Prop 50 passed on Election Day with more than 64% of the vote.",
      "Missouri and North Carolina's Republican-led legislatures have each redrawn their maps in an attempt to gain a new GOP-friendly seat.",
      "Maryland Democrats may undertake a similar effort to edge out the state's one Republican House member, though the idea has faced resistance from some Democratic legislators.",
      "The redistricting campaigns have drawn lawsuits in some states. The Supreme Court last week allowed Texas to use its newly drawn congressional map for now, halting a lower court ruling that found the new map was racially gerrymandered.",
      "Editor's note: This story was updated to correct an inaccuracy in the number of senators who voted against the bill.",
      "Hunter  Woodall and \n                                                  \n                                  Aaron  Navarro\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:06:48 -0500",
    "summary": "For the second time in a month, prosecutors in Virginia failed to secure an indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
    "story": [
      "A federal grand jury on Thursday refused to indict former New York Attorney General Letitia James for a second time in about a week, according to two sources familiar with grand jury proceedings \u2014 as prosecutors struggle to revive a criminal case against the Trump foe.",
      "Federal prosecutors presented James' case to grand jurors in Alexandria, Virginia, after a separate grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia, turned down the case last week.",
      "The Justice Department is considering trying to indict James again next week, this time in Richmond, Virginia, a source familiar with the investigation told CBS News.",
      "The repeated setbacks are extremely unusual, as grand juries almost never decline to indict people. In the 2016 fiscal year, federal prosecutors reported not bringing charges because they failed to get an indictment just six times, out of more than 150,000 arrests, according to Justice Department figures.",
      "The Justice Department is fighting to re-indict James after a federal judge tossed out a bank fraud case against her last month, on the grounds that the lead prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, was serving in her job unlawfully.",
      "That ruling also threw out an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey on the same grounds. It's unclear whether the Justice Department will try to revive the charges against Comey, who was accused of lying to Congress in 2020. The statute of limitations for Comey's charges has lapsed, but the government may argue it is entitled to an extension.",
      "James was initially charged in October with allegedly making a false statement on mortgage paperwork for a house she bought in 2020. Prosecutors accused her of falsely claiming the property would serve as her second home, but instead using it as a rental and investment property, allowing her to save thousands of dollars by getting a lower interest rate.",
      "James has denied the allegations and argued the case against her is politically motivated.",
      "President Trump's enmity for James stretches back to 2022, when James sued the then-former president and his company in civil court for allegedly misstating the value of his real estate to get better lending and insurance terms. A judge found Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization liable, ordering them to pay hundreds of millions of dollars. Earlier this year, an appellate court tossed out the financial judgement but was divided on the merits of the case.",
      "James's attorneys have argued the case against her should be tossed out due to vindictive prosecution and \"outrageous government conduct.\" They've pointed to a Truth Social post in which the president urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into her, and alleged \"unethical behavior\" by several officials at the Justice Department and the Fair Housing Finance Authority.",
      "Halligan's office sought charges against Comey and James following upheaval in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Her predecessor as the office's top prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned in late September amid fears among staff that he would be forced out for refusing to charge James, CBS News has previously reported. Days later, Halligan \u2014 a former White House staffer and personal attorney to Mr. Trump \u2014 was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney. Comey was indicted less than a week after that, and James was indicted a few weeks later.",
      "Both Comey and James argued that Halligan was not legally appointed to her role, and asked for their charges to be tossed out. U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie dismissed their indictments without prejudice, meaning the government could attempt to indict them again.",
      "In a statement, James's attorney Abbe Lowell called the saga \"a stain on this Department's reputation,\" and said any \"further attempt to revive these discredited charges would be a mockery of our system of justice.\"",
      "\"For the second time in seven days, the Department of Justice has failed in its clear attempt to fulfill President Trump's political vendetta against Attorney General James,\" Lowell wrote Thursday. \"This unprecedented rejection makes even clearer that this case should never have seen the light of day.\"",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",

      "Bloomberg first reported the oil tanker seizure. Mr. Trump announced the seizure during a roundtable meeting at the White House, saying the tanker was \"seized for a very good reason.\"",
      "\"As you probably know, we've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large,\" he said. \"Largest one ever seized, actually. And other things are happening, so you'll be seeing that later and you'll be talking about that later with some other people.\"",
      "When asked by a reporter what will happen to the oil on the ship, Mr. Trump responded, \"Well we keep it, I guess,\" adding, \"I assume we're going to keep the oil.\"",

      "\"In these circumstances, the real reasons for the prolonged aggression against Venezuela have finally been exposed. It's not migration. It's not drug trafficking. It's not democracy. It's not human rights. It was always about our natural wealth, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people,\" the Venezuelan government said.",
      "The tanker is called The Skipper, according to three sources familiar with the seizure. The operation to seize it started at about 6 a.m. Wednesday and involved two helicopters, 10 Coast Guard members, 10 Marines and special operation forces, according to a senior military official and a source familiar with the operation. The Skipper had just left port in Venezuela when it was seized, they said.",
      "The helicopters used in the tanker seizure launched from the USS Gerald Ford and the boarding team was comprised of the Coast Guard's Maritime Security and Response Team, an elite maritime-interdiction unit based on the East Coast in Chesapeake, Virginia, according to a senior military official and a source familiar with the operation.",
      "The USS Gerald Ford, the most advanced aircraft carrier in the U.S.'s fleet, arrived in the Caribbean last month amid a larger military buildup in the region.",
      "The Skipper was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for alleged ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah. At the time, it sailed under the name Adisa. The 20-year-old tanker previously sailed under the name The Toyo in 2005, according to public maritime data.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi shared video of the seizure on social media, writing that the tanker was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\" and had been seized by the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Coast Guard, \"with support from the Department of War.\"",
      "\"For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,\" Bondi wrote.",

For multiple\u2026 pic.twitter.com/dNr0oAGl5x",
      "The operation was led by the United States Coast Guard, supported by Navy forces, according to U.S. officials. Any such operation would legally require the Coast Guard to be the lead agency, because the authorities used for these seizures fall under Coast Guard jurisdiction.",
      "While the U.S. government \u2014 particularly the Justice Department and Homeland Security Investigations \u2014 has seized sanctioned oil tankers before, conducting a fast-rope boarding from helicopters at sea is rare, though it is something the boarding teams train for.",
      "The Trump administration is considering more missions similar to Wednesday's seizure, according to the senior military official and a source familiar with the operation.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 13:24:43 -0500",
    "summary": "With the partisan exercise behind them, some senators are expressing tepid optimism about a path forward on a health care compromise.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Thursday rejected a pair of bills to address rising health care costs, with lawmakers unable to reach a bipartisan agreement on extending tax credits that help millions of Americans purchase insurance under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "But with the partisan exercise behind them, some senators are expressing tepid optimism about a path forward on a compromise. Lawmakers who had sought a bipartisan path forward in recent weeks have said the failed votes could be key to unlocking a deal that would extend the subsidies with reforms aimed at addressing fraud. Four Republican senators joined Democrats in voting to extend the subsidies on Thursday, hinting that an agreement might be possible.",
      "\"After we fail, I like to think we succeed,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, told CBS News on Wednesday. Murkowski voted to extend the tax credits, along with GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Josh Hawley of Missouri.",
      "The health care issue was left unresolved in the government shutdown fight earlier this fall, when Democrats sought to extend the subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the government. Republicans wouldn't negotiate during the shutdown. But the end of the stalemate failed to produce an agreement.",
      "Some Republicans are open to an extension of the enhanced tax credits on a temporary basis, acknowledging the cliff that around 22 million Americans face with their expiration. But a compromise would likely need to involve reforms to the program to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the credits.",
      "Republicans have put forward a number of ideas to address health care costs, including shorter-term extensions that impose new limits.",
      "GOP Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, who introduced his own plan this week to extend the credits by one year before redirecting funds into HSA-style accounts in 2027, expressed optimism about a possible extension ahead of Thursday's votes.",
      "\"I still think we're gaining momentum every day, and I'm going to keep moving forward until someone tells me to stop,\" Marshall told reporters.",
      "But Marshall indicated he doesn't see a solution coming together before senators leave town later this month for the winter holidays.",
      "\"We can't get a Democrat to even agree on the fraud portion of our bill. And if we can't agree to address fraud, it's hard to figure out these other steps,\" Marshall said. \"I really think we're making progress on a bipartisan basis, pointing towards a January solution.\"",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, outlined a shorter timeline to reach a compromise, saying that Democrats will use the coming price hikes as a key political issue heading into the midterm elections.",
      "\"Now is the time to get it done,\" Tillis told CBS News.",
      "Tillis said Senate Democratic leaders likely aren't interested in a compromise, since \"they see the political opportunity this represents.\" But among the rank and file, the North Carolina Republican said he expects a\u00a0 \"sufficient number\" would support an extension that addresses fraud. He pointed to a proposal by Collins, which would extend the tax credits for two years and include income caps.",
      "Ahead of the votes, Tillis said the partisan measures needed to fail before some Democrats might be willing to reach a compromise.",
      "\"It's amazing, sometimes, what can get done in a week,\" Tillis said. \"But we have a week.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who negotiated the deal with Republicans to end the shutdown last month, also indicated openness to a compromise.",
      "\"I'm ready to come to the table and I think we would be better served if after we get through these votes, we sit down and come to a compromise to address the real costs that people are facing in terms of health care,\" Shaheen said on the Senate floor Thursday. \"And I'm ready to do that.\"",
      "Shaheen acknowledged the ideas put forward by Republicans, calling the engagement \"constructive.\" But she stressed that time is short to extend the tax credits.",
      "\"I know there are members in both parties who want to find a responsible path forward,\" she said. \"I welcome the discussion on where we can find common ground\u2026 But first we must keep millions of Americans from losing coverage in the coming months.\"",
      "Even Senate Majority Leader John Thune wouldn't rule out an extension of the tax credits in the near future.",
      "\"The question is, are there enough Democrats who actually want to fix the problem, to work with the Republicans, a lot of us, who want to fix the problem? Or are they going to succumb to their leadership and probably where their far left base is and just want to make this a political issue?\" Thune said.",
      "The South Dakota Republican said \"if you did something with reforms and structured this program differently so it puts downward pressure on premium instead of upward pressure, I think you could do something.\"",
      "Thune said that conversations are ongoing between rank-and-file members on both sides who have \"an interest in solving it.\"",
      "There has been chatter on Capitol Hill about Republicans opting to go it alone on health care using reconciliation, which would allow them to approve changes with a simple majority. Thune said he wouldn't rule anything out, but said he prefers a bipartisan approach.",
      "\"If we could do something at 60, those results tend to be, you know, more durable over time \u2026 but I wouldn't rule anything out,\" Thune said.",
      "The optimism around a bipartisan path forward in the Senate comes as a number of Republican moderates in the House have started to buck GOP leaders and try to force a vote on their own proposal. House Republicans in vulnerable districts have been sounding the alarm about the political consequences of failing to address the coming price spikes. But Speaker Mike Johnson has indicated he would not bring an extension of the tax credits up for a vote, saying the majority of the GOP conference does not support the move.",
      "On Wednesday, moderate Republicans filed a discharge petition aimed at requiring a vote on a bill to extend the ACA subsidies. Some of them also support a Democratic petition to compel a vote. The petitions would require 218 signatures to bring the underlying bills to the floor, and both have already accumulated enough Republican support that they would succeed if all Democrats sign on.",
      "Murkowski pointed to the slew of recent proposals from across the Capitol as evidence of shared interest in finding a solution.",
      "\"Look at the various proposals out there. Whether it's the all-Democrat proposal here or the bipartisan proposals over in the House or the all-Republican proposals over here \u2014 there's a lot of shared elements, right,\" she told CBS News. \"There's a lot that's out there that we just need to cobble together into one package that makes sense, recognizing that it's going to be short-term, and go from there.\"",
      "Asked why it hasn't happened yet, Murkowski told reporters \"I don't know.\"",
      "\"I guess we have to demonstrate our failures first before we can applaud our successes,\" she said.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 12:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Luxury cars, homes, jewelry and casino trips were among the spoils of some of the biggest pandemic era fraud cases, according to a CBS News review of five years of government records and data.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors have repeatedly called the fraud case that plundered Minnesota's child nutrition program the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States.\" But it's far from the only multimillion-dollar scheme to cheat the U.S. government out of taxpayers money that Congress intended to help the country through the economic disaster that accompanied the COVID-19 crisis.",
      "A CBS News analysis of government data and records determined the Minnesota fraudsters appear to have made off with more taxpayer money than any other individual scheme. Dozens of people in that state have been charged, and more than 50 have been convicted or pleaded guilty.",
      "But the review of court files, government audits and investigative documents identified at least 20 other cases that each cost taxpayers at least $1 million. At least nine known cases cost more than $10 million apiece.",
      "Outside the Minnesota case, the next most costly fraud cases were highlighted by a related pair of Paycheck Protection Program loan scams run out of Arizona that defrauded the federal government of $109 million and $63 million. The program, known as PPP, was intended to provide businesses forgivable loans to keep workers on their payrolls while they were shut down or operating at a loss because of public-health restrictions.",
      "A separate fraudulent COVID-test billing scam out of Chicago cost the government some $83 million.",
      "CBS News reviewed court records, Department of Justice announcements, government audits and inspector general reports and the records of the federal government's Pandemic Response Accountability Committee to identify cases with losses of at least $1 million each, then studied each case for details.",
      "The CBS News review focused the financial losses for each case on the money received or obtained from the government, rather than the sometimes much larger amounts that the schemes attempted or sought.",
      "Here is a list of the 10 largest document cases identified in the public record.",
      "1. Feeding Our Future",
      "Estimated fraud value:\u00a0$250 million",
      "What happened: A Minnesota nonprofit group\u00a0called Feeding Our Future partnered with the state Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children during the pandemic. But prosecutors say instead the group submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices claiming they helped feed thousands, making millions of dollars in administrative fees and taking kickbacks from meal distribution sites, according to\u00a0court documents. Feeding Our Future's founder, Aimee Bock, was convicted earlier this year. Numerous other defendants have pleaded guilty or were convicted.",
      "2. Karnezis brothers PPP loan scam",
      "Estimated fraud value:\u00a0At least $109 million",
      "What happened:\u00a0Two Arizona brothers pleaded guilty to submitting thousands of fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loan applications, including some through Blueacorn (a lending service provider which was implicated in a separate PPP loan fraud case). Government forensic auditors found the brothers falsified business records and misrepresented eligibility certifications, often using similar wording in the narratives and supporting documents across multiple faked applicants for the loans.",
      "3. COVID-testing fraud",
      "Estimated fraud value:\u00a0At least $83 million",
      "What happened:\u00a0A Chicago-area laboratory owner allegedly billed tens of millions of dollars for COVID-19 tests\u00a0that federal prosecutors say were never performed, improperly conducted, or already had been reimbursed under a program that supposed to provide tests for people without health insurance. Investigators found the lab issued negative results for unperformed tests, submitted batches of duplicate claims, and manipulated clinical data to try to hide the fraud. The owner/defendant, Zishan Alvi, of Inverness, Illinois, pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2024 and was sentenced to seven years in prison.",
      "4. Blueacorn",
      "Estimated fraud value:\u00a0At least $63 million",
      "What happened:\u00a0Blueacorn, a lender service provider, fraudulently obtained at least $63 million in PPP loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. The co-founders pleaded guilty. One co-founder, Stephanie Hockridge of Arizona, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Government auditors say they found as many as 1,600 applicants with extremely repetitive data and recycled identities. The federal government's Pandemic Response Accountability Committee estimated the losses could have been as much as $111 million, but the court-ordered restitution ordered was $63 million.",
      "5. Recycling companies' fake PPP loan ring",
      "Estimated fraud value:\u00a0At least $53 million",
      "What happened:\u00a0Fourteen people were arrested and charged in Texas, California and Oklahoma in 2023 for allegedly engineering a nationwide fraudulent PPP loan ring using fabricated IRS documents, payroll logs and front companies. The individuals used a network of purported recycling companies to make at least 29 fraudulent loan applications, according to Justice Department records.",
      "6. California PPP fraud scheme",
      "Estimated fraud value:\u00a0At least $27 million",
      "What happened:\u00a0A federal jury convicted a California man who allegedly created eight companies on paper, each claiming 100 employees and a monthly payroll of $400,000, according to Justice Department records. Between April and August 2020, Robert Benlevi of Encino submitted 27 Paycheck Protection Program applications to four banks using fabricated tax records and boilerplate language about nonexistent operations, according to federal records. Benlevi was convicted of bank fraud, false statements to a financial institution, and money laundering.",
      "7. Nationwide PPP and check-cashing fraud scheme",
      "Estimated fraud value:\u00a0At least $18 million",
      "What happened:\u00a0A network of 11 people in Texas and Illinois allegedly filed more than 80 PPP applications across a web of nominally unrelated businesses in 2020 and 2021, including faking and cashing payroll checks that sometimes went to relatives, according to Justice Department records. The conspirators sought $35 million in loan funds, but were paid out $18 million. Some already have pleaded guilty.",
      "8. PPP scheme involving NFL player",
      "Estimated fraud value:\u00a0At least $17.4 million",
      "What happened:\u00a0One of the earliest large-scale Paycheck Protection Program fraud rings involved more than 90 fraudulent applications submitted by a coordinated group of people from Ohio and Florida using templated applications, according to Justice Department records. Many of the loan applications were successful, producing over $17 million in payouts. Former NFL player Joshua J. Bellamy of St. Petersburg, Florida, allegedly received more than $1.2 million for his own shell company and prosecutors say he spent funds on jewelry and other luxury goods and casino trips. Investigators identified recurring wording and patterns across loan submissions, including identical employee lists and other payroll details. Bellamy pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 37 months in prison.",
      "9. Texas businessman uses PPP for luxury cars and homes",
      "Estimated fraud value:\u00a0At least $17 million",
      "What happened:\u00a0A Coppell, Texas, businessman pleaded guilty to submitting 15 fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loan applications seeking nearly $25 million for several businesses he controlled. Each application featured inflated employee counts and falsified payroll documentation, according to court records. Federal prosecutors reported the man purchased eight homes and six luxury vehicles, all seized by federal agents along with other significant assets. The businessman, Dinesh Sah, got an 11-year prison sentence and was ordered to pay $9 million in restitution.",
      "10. NYC PPP loan scheme",
      "Estimated fraud value:\u00a0At least $9.4 million",
      "What happened:\u00a0A New York City woman recruited multiple people to apply for PPP loans in exchange for kickbacks. Sherry Joseph, of New York, pleaded guilty in federal court in Florida to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in 2022. The loan applications included faked bank statements and payrolls, according to court records. The DOJ's prosecutors said that Joseph engaged in the scheme while on pretrial release for separate federal fraud-related offenses in New Jersey.",
      "There were at least 10 other cases with $1 million or more in losses documented in federal law enforcement, court and audit records, according to the CBS review.",

    "story": [
      "Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex crimes and a group of Democratic members of Congress are asking for an independent review of the Epstein case files to determine whether any of the records have been \"tampered\" with or concealed, ahead of the release of those files by next week.",
      "In a letter Thursday to the Justice Department's inspector general, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the internal watchdog to undertake a formal review to check for any \"chain of custody\" problems with the Epstein files.",
      "Speaking with CBS News, representatives of some Epstein survivors have also asked for a third-party review to check if any record has been \"scrubbed, softened, or quietly removed before the public sees it.\"",
      "Under a federal law signed by President Trump last month, the Trump administration is required to release virtually all files on the government's investigations into Epstein by a Dec. 19 deadline, with minimal redactions.",
      "Three federal judges have also issued rulings this month to unseal grand jury records in the criminal investigations into Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. The rulings have opened the door for large batches of investigative materials to be publicly released by the administration for the first time.",
      "The impending releases follow months of pressure from both parties for the Trump administration to disclose more information on the government's Epstein probes. The financier pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida in the 2000s, and was charged with child sex trafficking in 2019, but died by suicide in federal custody while awaiting trial.",
      "Thursday's letter from Senate Democrats \u2014 including Sen. Adam Schiff of California \u2014 pointed to allegations that Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel ordered a massive review of Epstein-related records, \"which resulted in around 1,000 FBI personnel working 24-hour shifts and required personnel to identify any mentions of President Trump.\"",
      "\"To reassure the American public that any files released have not been tampered with or concealed, the chain of custody forms associated with records and evidence in the Epstein files must be accounted for, analyzed, and released,\" the request read.",
      "The allegation that federal workers looked for mentions of Mr. Trump was initially leveled over the summer by the Senate Judiciary Committee's vice-chair, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, who cited information his office had received. Durbin was one of the signatories of Thursday's letter. The New York Times later reported that the FBI looked for references to Mr. Trump and other high-profile people.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The inspector general's office did not comment to CBS News, and generally does not speak about its communication with Congress.",
      "Spencer Kuvin, a civil attorney who has represented a group of Epstein survivors, has also raised concerns about the trustworthiness of the records that are set to be released. Kuvin told CBS News, \"There should absolutely be concern about the chain of custody of the Epstein files.\"",
      "\"These records have passed through too many hands, behind too many closed doors, for anyone to simply assume they're intact, unaltered, or complete,\" Kuvin said. \"Survivors have endured decades of secrecy, broken promises, and institutional protection of powerful men; they should not now be asked to trust a process with no independent verification",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are asking for the inspector general to audit the handling of the case files and publicly release results of the audit by Jan. 19. Schiff's letter to the inspector general said the group would like answers to several questions, including: \"how many individuals have obtained custody over the materials\" ahead of the release?",
      "In July, the Justice Department moved to unseal grand jury materials in the Epstein and Maxwell investigations, but those initial bids were denied, because federal rules required grand jury proceedings and evidence to be kept secret.",
      "However, after the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the Justice Department argued that the law should override grand jury secrecy rules.",

She has also criticized the effects Mr. Trump's tariffs and mass deportation efforts are having on U.S. businesses.",

      "Greene told CBS News on Wednesday that the president's name-calling could alienate women voters.",
      "\"He always continues to speak about women like this, and that's something that women all over the country pay attention to,\" she said. \"I think the Republican Party needs to take a hard look at it, because the Republican Party has a very difficult time with women voting for them.\"",
      "\"It's unfortunate that President Trump thinks loyalty is a one-way street. It's really not,\" she added. \"I do feel sorry for him, because I think he's extremely unaware, and I don't know how he can be unaware about this, but he's not aware of how it makes him really look.\"",
      "Greene also questioned the president's apparent dismissal of Americans' concerns about the state of the economy. As lawmakers in both parties stress the need to address affordability, Mr. Trump has defended his economic policies and called Democrats' focus on the issue a \"hoax.\" Asked earlier this week to give the economy a letter grade, he responded: \"A+++++.\"",
      "\"The president needs to be aware that he's a billionaire president of the United States,\" she said. \"You can't gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable, and you can't tell them that the economy is in A+++. You just can't do that, and I think it's insulting to people's intelligence.\"",
      "\"I do believe at this time that Republicans will lose the midterms\"",
      "Asked if the issue of affordability could cost the GOP its majority next year, the Georgia lawmaker said she doesn't believe the party is doing enough to embrace a message of economic populism.",
      "\"I do believe at this time that Republicans will lose the midterms, and I think that's unfortunate,\" Greene said. \"I very much wanted to be part of a Republican majority in Congress that solved problems for the American people, that delivered what we promised to America.\"",
      "Greene said she did not give Speaker Mike Johnson a heads up before announcing her retirement. Her exit next month leaves the Louisiana Republican with a slimmer margin in the House.",
      "\"This was a personal decision between myself and my family, which I had their full support, so I didn't think I owed him that,\" she explained. \"He just texted me and asked me to reconsider.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Johnson told CBS News he was \"surprised\" by Greene's decision.",
      "\"It's no secret she and I've had disagreements over the last couple years, but I like Marjorie, I always have. I respect her decision, and I wish her the best,\" Johnson said.",
      "Greene,\u00a0who once threatened to oust the speaker, said she agrees with other female colleagues, including GOP Reps.\u00a0Elise Stefanik\u00a0of New York and\u00a0Nancy Mace\u00a0of South Carolina, who recently criticized Johnson's leadership.",
      "\"I think he has a broader problem with the entire conference as a whole,\" Greene explained. \"The Republicans have a problem. They're going to have a really hard time trying to go back to their districts and ask for re-election and new Republican candidates running in other House seats are going to have a very hard time asking for votes when this Congress, this Republican majority here, has produced hardly anything to give back to the people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Wednesday he still has confidence in the speaker to hold his conference together.",
      "\"I think Mike Johnson has been a fantastic speaker,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I've had a very hard job because, you know, we have a small majority, and we got the biggest bill in the history of our country approved, the great, big beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"I'll believe it when I see it,\" Greene says on release of Epstein files",
      "Greene's rift with the president deepened over the release of the Epstein files. She was one of the early signers of a bipartisan petition to compel the Justice Department to fully disclose information about the convicted sex offender. The Epstein Files Transparency Act\u00a0passed in the House and Senate\u00a0overwhelmingly last month. It orders the Justice Department to make the files public within 30 days, by Dec. 19.",
      "\"I'll believe it when I see it, and I really hope the Trump administration does the right thing,\" she said. \"I think, if they don't release all of the information, and the women are the ones that will know, I think that will be a complete break of trust with MAGA.\"",
      "\"In my heart, I feel completely freed of this whole situation, because if President Trump called me a traitor, over standing with these women who were raped, victimized, trafficked for so many years, and this is something the government completely covered up and protected rich, powerful elites, if that's why President Trump called me a traitor, then I'm like, that's fine, you know, I'm completely okay with it,\" Greene added.",
      "But she said death threats she and her family faced went too far, and ultimately factored into her decision to step down.",
      "\"It was the direct death threats and assassination threats on my son, and that crossed my line,\" Greene said. \"It should cross anyone's line, no matter who we are, no matter what disagreements we have.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/indiana-redistricting-9-0-congressional-map-vote-republicans/",
    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 20:49:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The push to redistrict in Indiana has a crucial vote in the state's Senate on Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "Indiana's state Senate will decide on Thursday whether or not they'll pass a new congressional map that will make all nine of the state's U.S. House districts lean toward Republicans.",
      "This possibility of adding two GOP-friendly seats in Indiana has been a political priority of the Trump administration, as Democrat-run and Republican-run states have been trading blows in a nationwide redistricting arms race ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "But the contentious debate also spawned bomb threats and swatting incidents against Indiana lawmakers, as enough Indiana Republican state lawmakers are opposed to a new map to put its passage in jeopardy.",
      "Republicans already represent seven of Indiana's nine Congressional districts, while Democrats represent two districts, one near southwest Chicago and one that encompasses Indianapolis. The proposed map drastically breaks apart the Indianapolis-based district of Democratic Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson to dilute the city's Democratic-leaning electorate.",
      "The map passed in the Indiana state House with a 57-41 vote earlier this month, but Indiana Senate president Rodric Bray has previously insisted the votes needed to pass the map are not there.",
      "At least 25 of the state's 50 senators would have to vote yes for the map to pass, with Republican Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith being the tiebreaker vote. There are 40 Republican senators in the chamber, while\u00a0 at least 12 state senators have come out publicly against the map with several keeping their stance private, according to the IndyStar.",
      "\"It's a toss up,\" said GOP operative Marty Obst, chair of the \"Fair Maps Indiana\" nonprofit pushing for a middecade redraw. He said there's about ten state Republican senators who are still undecided, in part because they want to hear more from constituents and during this week's debate on the senate floor.",
      "\"We'll obviously need a few of those to get to 25,\" he said. \"It should be an interesting day on Thursday. It's truly up in the air.\"",
      "Lawmakers against the map have shared doubts that Republicans can even win all nine seats in the new proposed map, have cited pushback from constituents about a new map, and cited the unusual nature of redrawing Congressional lines in the middle of the decade, not after the 2020 Census like Indiana and the rest of the country did in 2021.",
      "\"What's taking people by surprise is the novelty of politicians who prioritize fidelity to principle, over flirtations with politics. It's so old it's new again,\" said Indiana GOP operative Pete Seat.",
      "State Republicans in favor of the map have argued Indiana shouldn't be on the sidelines on gerrymandering, and pointed to states gerrymandered by Democrats such as California or nearby Illinois.",
      "\"We've consistently seen the Democrats use that process to increase and rule their influence in Washington D.C .... what the administration is challenging Republicans with is that we have to push back,\" state Republican Sen. Andy Zay told CBS affiliate WANE\u00a0in Fort Wayne, Indiana.",
      "Three Republican senators on the Indiana Senate elections committee who voted to advance the map on Monday said they reserve the right to still vote no on Thursday.",
      "Throughout the year, the White House has flexed its political muscle to push for redistricting in Indiana.",
      "President Trump lashed out at Republican holdouts in the Indiana Senate in a Truth Social post Wednesday, and called Bray \"either a bad guy, or a very stupid one.\"",
      "\"Anybody that votes against Redistricting, and the SUCCESS of the Republican Party in D.C., will be, I am sure, met with a MAGA primary in the Spring,\" the president wrote. \"Rod Bray and his friends won't be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance has met with Indiana GOP lawmakers several times this year in Indianapolis and in Washington D.C. to push for a mid-decade redraw. Mr. Trump met with Indiana House and Senate leaders in the Oval Office in August and has called state lawmakers about redistricting.",
      "\"I will be strongly endorsing against any State Senator or House member from the Great State of Indiana that votes against the Republican Party, and our Nation, by not allowing for Redistricting,\" Trump wrote in a November Truth Social post.",
      "That pressure campaign from outside actors was already in effect going into the votes. Obst's nonprofit, Indiana Fair Maps, has already spent over $250,000 on advertisements encouraging lawmakers to pass the map. On Monday, a super PAC affiliated with his nonprofit announced they will spend up to seven-figures in the 2026 primary elections to support members in favor of redistricting, as well as recruit and financially back challengers against lawmakers who are against it. Obst says this effort will happen regardless of whether or not the map passes.",
      "Turning Point USA, the conservative organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk, held a rally in Indiana's statehouse earlier this month where Indiana Gov. Mike Braun spoke in favor of the new map. Several Turning Point USA officials, including Trump adviser Alex Bruesewitz, have also been calling out lawmakers against redistricting in the last two months on social media.",
      "But as more attention has been paid to redistricting in Indiana, several state Republican lawmakers as well as Braun, have gotten bomb threats and swatting incidents. Republican state Sen. Jean Leising, who is against a new Congressional map in Indiana, was the target of a pipe bomb threat. She called it a \"result of the D.C. political pundits for redistricting.\"",
      "\"I fear for this institution. I fear for the state of Indiana, I fear for all states if we allow intimidation and threats to be the norm,\" said Republican state Sen. Greg Walker, the only member of the state Senate's election committee who voted against moving the new map forward.",
      "Obst called the threats \"uncalled for\" and that he doesn't support any of the threats to lawmakers. \"I've been in Indiana politics for 20 years... we're trying to have a debate and get redistricting done. But this is uncalled for,\" he said.",
      "Indiana's middecade redistricting push comes after other efforts have taken place nationwide, starting this summer in Texas, where Republicans in the state legislature redrew their congressional map at the request of Mr. Trump to net up to five seats for their party. California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom then spearheaded a ballot measure that passed with more than 60% of the vote to redraw their map to gain up to five seats for Democrats. Missouri's legislature then redrew their map to try to shift one more seat toward Republicans, and North Carolina undertook a similar effort to edge out a Democrat in its 1st Congressional District. Other Democrat-run states like Maryland and Illinois are also considering a redraw to add more Democratic seats.",

    "summary": "Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced a discharge petition to try to bring a bill to the floor that would extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies by two years.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican moderates in the House revolted against leadership on Wednesday as they seek to force a vote on expiring health insurance premium tax credits \u2014 an issue that could have major political ramifications for the party in next year's elections.",
      "Facing an end-of-year deadline, Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced a discharge petition to try to bring a bill to the floor that would extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies by two years. A handful of GOP moderates quickly signed on.",
      "The move is the latest rebellion by rank-and-file Republicans to force votes on issues that leadership would rather avoid.",
      "The underlying proposal, spearheaded by Fitzpatrick, would extend the tax credits through 2027 and impose a cap on income for those who are eligible for the subsidies. The plan would also expand access to health savings accounts, while imposing a small monthly premium on the lowest-income beneficiaries to fight fraudulent enrollments.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after Fitzpatrick filed the discharge petition that an extension does not have the support of the majority of the conference. An informal rule in the House, known as the Hastert rule, dictates that the speaker should only bring up legislation if it has the support of the majority of the party in power.",
      "\"I understand the concerns that they have. I'm very sympathetic to that. We have spent many, many hours trying to find a way out of the conundrum that we're in, with regard to those extensions,\" Johnson said. \"We just can't get Republican votes on that for lots of reasons, not enough of them.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said last week that the plan was the \"best product we can put together\" and had feedback from the House, Senate and White House. A discharge petition, he said, was a last-ditch option.",
      "The procedural tactic requires 218 signatures to force a vote, and it's unclear if it can reach that threshold. It would need the support of most Democrats, who have been pushing a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Later Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey filed a competing discharge petition to try to force a vote on a separate bipartisan proposal that includes a one-year extension of the tax credits with income limits, followed by a second year with \"more significant reforms,\" including eliminating $0 premiums, with need-based exceptions.",
      "House GOP leaders vowed to unveil a path forward next week. But they've made few details public about what their plan entails, other than holding votes on bills that they say will lower premiums for \"100% of Americans.\" They will have just days to build consensus before Dec. 18, their last scheduled day in session for the year.",

      "The move places long stretches of the border under the supervision of nearby military bases, empowering U.S. troops to detain people who enter the country illegally and sidestep a law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. It is done under the authority of the national emergency on the border declared by Mr. Trump on his first day in office.",
      "The military strategy was pioneered in April along a 170-mile stretch of the border in New Mexico and later expanded to portions of the border in Texas and Arizona.",
      "The newly designated militarized zone extends nearly from the Arizona state line to the Otay Mountain Wilderness, traversing the Imperial Valley and border communities including the unincorporated community of Tecate, California, across the border from the Mexican city with the same name.",
      "More than 7,000 troops have been deployed to the border, along with an assortment of helicopters, drones and surveillance equipment.",
      "The zones allow U.S. troops to apprehend immigrants and others who are accused of trespassing on Army, Air Force or Navy bases. Those apprehended also could face additional criminal charges that can mean prison time.",
      "U.S. authorities say the zones are needed to close gaps in border enforcement and help in the wider fight against human smuggling networks and brutal drug cartels.",
      "\"By working with the Navy to close long-standing security gaps, we are strengthening national defense, protecting our public lands from unlawful use, and advancing the President's agenda,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a news release.",
      "The new militarized zone was announced the same day a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to end the deployment of California National Guard troops in Los Angeles and return control of those troops to the state.",
      "The state sued after Mr. Trump called up more than 4,000 California National Guard troops in June without Gov. Gavin Newsom's approval to further the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing to ask visitors from several dozen nations that enjoy visa-free travel to the U.S. to submit additional personal information before entering the country, including five years of their social media history, the Department of Homeland Security said in a notice this week.",
      "Citizens of 42 countries enrolled in the visa waiver program can generally come to the U.S. for up to 90 days for tourism or business travel, without needing to apply for a visa at an American embassy or consulate, a process that can take months or even years.",
      "The list of countries in the visa waiver program includes many European nations like the United Kingdom, Germany and France, as well as some U.S. allies around the world, including Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.",
      "While citizens of these nations typically don't need visas to travel to the U.S., they still have to submit an application online using a process known as the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, before entering the country. That system is designed to ensure applicants are eligible for visa-free travel to the U.S., and that they don't pose security concerns.",
      "The Trump administration is proposing to overhaul the ESTA system, mainly to transform it into a mobile-only process. The plan would require applicants to share additional information about themselves and their relatives, according to a notice posted in the federal government's journal of regulations by Customs and Border Protection, a branch of DHS.",
      "The notice said CBP plans to ask visa waiver travelers to share their social media history for the past five years, emails they have used for the past 10 years and the personal information of immediate family members, including phone numbers and residences. The submission of social media history from the last five years will be a mandatory requirement under the proposal, according to the notice.",
      "CBP said the changes, which still have to be reviewed by the White House's budget office, are designed to enforce an executive order President Trump issued earlier this year with the stated objective of denying entry to foreigners who may pose a threat to national security or public safety.",
      "But critics of the proposed changes said they could scare prospective travelers and negatively impact tourism, especially months before the U.S. hosts the 2026 FIFA World Cup, alongside Canada and Mexico, next summer.",
      "Over the past year, the Trump administration has mounted an aggressive effort to increase vetting and screening procedures across the U.S. immigration system.",
      "While the State Department has moved to scrutinize visa applicants overseas more heavily, some of the changes affect people already in the U.S. who are applying to stay in the country legally through applications for asylum, green cards or American citizenship.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has instructed officials to investigate the social media history of several classes of immigrants, including for views and activities deemed to be \"anti-American.\" It has also directed adjudicators to more intensely probe the \"good moral character\" of legal immigrants requesting U.S. citizenship.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 20:50:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump spoke about affordability and his economic agenda in the Poconos, in northeastern Pennsylvania, Tuesday night.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 After weeks of decrying the focus on \"affordability\" and calling it a \"Democratic hoax,\" President Trump spoke in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night to sell his economic agenda ahead of a challenging midterm election season for congressional Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump spent much of the more than 90-minute-long rally-style speech promoting and defending his economic record, saying,\u00a0\"America is winning again\" and \"Pennsylvania is prospering again.\" He touted job growth in the key battleground state, which has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the nation as a whole, and a decline in gas prices. The president also claimed his tariffs on foreign goods are paying dividends for the U.S. economy \u2014 despite worries from most economists that tariffs can lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices.",
      "He pointed to the tax components of his \"big, beautiful bill,\" including a plan to create\u00a0investment accounts for children \u2014 seeded with $1,000 from the federal government for eligible kids \u2014 and a tax deduction for tips.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted his decision to let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, a major employer in Pennsylvania. He said his administration \"saved\" the company, which he said is now \"hot as a pistol.\"",
      "\"The one thing you need, you need steel,\" he said. \"You know, you can give up certain products. You can give up pencils... You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls.\"",
      "He argued his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and said \"prices are coming down.\" Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in September, which is well below 2022 levels \u2014 when inflation hit 9.1% \u2014 but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Mr. Trump also continued blaming Democrats for affordability issues.",
      "\"They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,\" the president said.",
      "After initially focusing on cost-of-living issues, Mr. Trump veered off topic at times, riffing about immigration and polling members of the audience about whether to refer to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as \"sleepy Joe\" or \"crooked Joe.\"",
      "He also repeatedly brought up a fraud scandal that has enveloped Minnesota politics, and pointed to the fact that most of the defendants are of Somali descent. At several points, he urged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to \"do your job\" as Bessent's agency investigates allegations that Minnesota tax dollars went to the terror group al Shabaab.",
      "Trump addresses affordability after calling issue a \"scam\"",
      "The president has publicly and privately vented about the focus on affordability as an issue for weeks, referring to it as a \"hoax,\" a \"con job\" and a \"scam\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for focusing on affordability issues in Tuesday's speech, though he said: \"I can't call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"",
      "Last week, the president called the affordability issue a \"fake narrative\" made up by Democrats to sway the public. But at the same time, he said he had inherited problems with affordability from his predecessor.",
      "\"They just say the word,\" the president said during his Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. \"It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it \u2014 affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.\"",
      "Inflation has\u00a0edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, but the latest inflation numbers have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting meeting this week \u2014 because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In an interview published Tuesday, the president told Politico\u00a0that \"prices are all coming down.\"",
      "Behind the scenes, aides told CBS News last week that the president has grown increasingly irritated by perceptions that his policies aren't easing prices.",
      "His travel to sell his economic agenda in Pennsylvania is a quiet acknowledgement that he needs to do more to rally the public behind his policies. In Tuesday's speech, Mr. Trump said he decided to speak about affordability in part because chief of staff Susie Wiles told him he needed to start campaigning for the midterm elections.",
      "Polling shows voters are feeling the crunch of still-high prices and the cost of living, as well as the challenging market for job seekers \u2014 and many at least partially blame Mr. Trump.",
      "In a November CBS News/YouGov poll, 60% of respondents agreed Mr. Trump makes prices and inflation \"sound better than they really are.\" Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the president's policies are making grocery prices go up. Just 32% said the U.S. economy is good, down from 38% the month Mr. Trump took office in January. Respondents were most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important to them, and among those who listed the economy and inflation as their top priorities, 77% said the president is not spending enough time on those issues.",
      "The Palm Beach Post, a local paper near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida, published an opinion piece Tuesday with the headline, \"'Affordability' is not a hoax, Trump. Reality costs too much.\"",
      "Pennsylvania will feature key races for Republicans as they try to hold onto their majority in the House of Representatives in 2026. Mount Pocono, where Mr. Trump spoke Tuesday night, is just over 30 miles from Scranton, Biden's hometown.",
      "Cost of living worries still linger",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks come amid ongoing public frustration over the high cost of living in the U.S.",
      "Although U.S. inflation has fallen, the high cost of food, shelter, health care, utilities, child care and other basic necessities has remained a sore spot for millions of Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has vacillated between downplaying complaints about the economy and defending his administration's efforts to address affordability issues.",
      "In November, for example, the Trump administration removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. Mr. Trump last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump on Monday announced $12 billion in aid for farmers who have struggled under tariffs and because of the U.S trade war with China.",
      "\"We're bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. \"You can call it 'affordability' or anything you want, but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we're the ones that are fixing it.\"",
      "The economy has proved resilient this year despite earlier fears about the impact of steep new U.S. tariffs on imports. After losing steam in the first quarter, the nation's gross domestic product has accelerated in the second half of 2025, while the nation's labor market has remained steady despite slowing payroll gains.",
      "Financial markets also continue to hover in record territory, shrugging off concerns about a bubble in AI companies.",
      "At the same time, some experts describe the economy as \"K-shaped\" \u2014 a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder.",
      "Aimee  Picchi, \n                                                  \n                                  Fin  Daniel G\u00f3mez and \n                                                  \n                                  Olivia  Rinaldi\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 07:31:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Paleontologists have discovered and documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
    "story": [
      "Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters - capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California's Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\"There's no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\" said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \"We have all these world records at this particular site.\"",
      "Prints record dinosaur behavior \u2014 including attempts to swim",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "The longest swim trackway studied by the researchers measured over 130 meters in length. \"To date, it remains the longest exposed swim trackway in the world,\" the authors write in the study.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\"The preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\" said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\"This is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\" Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Footprints face preservation threats",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn't think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia's Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks - and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer - suggest that dinosaurs didn't settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",
      "The range in footprint sizes indicated that giant creatures roughly 10 meters (33 feet) tall moved in a herd with tiny theropods the size of a chicken, 32 centimeters (1 foot) tall at the hip.",
      "In presenting a snapshot of everyday behavior footprints \"reveal what skeletons cannot,\" said Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland in Australia who also did not participate in the study. Just from footprints, researchers can tell when dinosaurs strolled or sped up, stopped or turned around.",
      "It's not clear why so many dinosaurs roamed the site",
      "But the reason they flocked in droves to this wind-swept plateau remains a mystery.",
      "\"It may have been that they were all regular visitors to a large, ancient, freshwater lake, frequenting its expansive muddy shoreline,\" offered Romilio.",
      "Biaggi suggested that they were \"running away from something or searching for somewhere to settle.\"",
      "What's certain is that research into this treasure trove of a dinosaur tracksite will continue.",
      "\"I suspect that this will keep going over the years and many more footprints will be found right there at the edges of what's already uncovered,\" Biaggi said.",
      "Recent dinosaur footprint discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "In March, scientists in England discover a 650 foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom. \"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham,\u00a0told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "Launched in 2013 and having entered Mars' orbit in September 2014, Maven began studying the upper Martian atmosphere and its interaction with the solar wind.

    "story": [
      "A black hole inside a distant spiral galaxy is devouring material from the universe around it and creating winds at speeds never before seen by astronomers.",
      "The European Space Agency said that the black hole inside NGC 3783 has the mass of 30 million suns. The black hole consumes nearby material to power an active galactic nucleus at the center of the galaxy, the ESA said in a news release. The nucleus is \"an extremely bright and active region\" that sends out powerful jets and winds, the agency said.",
      "One powerful wind was measured at 60,000 kilometers per second, or 130 million piles per hour, about 20% of the speed of light.",
      "\"We've not watched a black hole create winds this speedily before,\" said Liyi Gu at Space Research Organisation Netherlands (SRON), in a statement. Gu led the international research team. \"For the first time, we've seen how a rapid burst of X-ray light from a black hole immediately triggers ultra-fast winds, with these winds forming in just a single day.\"",
      "Researcher Matteo Guainazzi said the winds around the black hole were created as the nucleus' tangled magnetic field suddenly untwisted, creating something similar to the coronal mass ejections that erupt from the sun \"but on a scale almost too big to imagine.\"",
      "The similarity between black holes and the sun makes \"these mysterious objects seem a little less alien,\" the ESA said. Project scientist Erik Kuulkers said the discovery \"suggests that solar and high-energy physics may work in surprisingly familiar ways throughout the universe.\"",
      "Winds from active galactic nuclei play a role in how the galaxies they are situated within develop, said ESA research fellow Camille Diez. Learning more about the nuclei and how they behave will lead to a better understanding of space, Diez said.",
      "\"Because they're so influential, knowing more about the magnetism of AGNs, and how they whip up winds such as these, is key to understanding the history of galaxies throughout the Universe,\" Diez said.",

    "story": [
      "A NASA astronaut and two cosmonaut crewmates strapped into their Soyuz ferry ship Monday evening, undocked from the International Space Station and plunged to an on-target landing on the frigid steppe of Kazakhstan early Tuesday to wrap up an\u00a0eight-month mission.",
      "With Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov strapped into the descent module's center seat, flanked on his left by cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky and on the right by NASA's Jonny Kim, the Soyuz MS-27/73S spacecraft undocked from the lab at 8:41 p.m. ET.",
      "After moving a safe distance away to a precise point in space, the Soyuz braking rockets fired for four minutes and 42 seconds starting at 11:09 p.m., slowing the ship's 17,100-mph velocity by about 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit into Earth's lower atmosphere.",
      "Enduring re-entry temperatures of some 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit -- and rapidly decelerating in the process -- the Soyuz descent module, suspended beneath a large orange-and-white parachute, landed at 12:03 a.m. EST Tuesday (0503 UTC, 10:03am local time in Kazakhstan) and tipped over on its side.",
      "Braving frigid sub-freezing weather, Russian recovery crews and NASA support personnel quickly reached the charred spacecraft, opening the Soyuz's hatch, extracting the crew and making initial medical checks as the trio began re-adjusting to gravity.",
      "Briefly resting in a nearby recliner as is traditional for returning  Soyuz crew members, Kim appeared healthy and in good spirits, smiling  his thanks after Russian recovery crews presented him with a nested  matryoshka doll with his face painted on the outermost shell.",
      "After  more detailed medical checks inside a heated inflatable tent, the crew was to be flown by helicopter to  the town of Dzhezkazgan where Kim planned to board a NASA jet for the long  flight home to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Ryzhikov and  Zubritsky will head for Star City near Moscow for debriefings and  reunions with family members.",
      "Left behind aboard the space station were NASA Crew 11 fliers Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "Also on board: Soyuz MS-28/74S commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, flight engineer Sergei Mikaev and NASA astronaut Christopher Williams. They arrived at the space station on Nov. 27 to replace Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim.",
      "During a change-of-command ceremony on Sunday, Kim said what he will remember most from his eight months in space is \"the bond that we shared together.\"",
      "\"I firmly believe that the greatest quality of an astronaut, and a human, is not technical competence, or loyalty, or any of the myriad other things we like to ascribe to astronauts. It's love,\" he said. \"We always gave each other grace and had so much love for each other and everyone who supports us. I think that is what makes space exploration possible.\"",
      "During their stay aboard the space station, Kim and his crewmates traveled 104 million miles over 3,920 orbits. Kim focused on research and maintenance in the U.S. segment of the station while Ryzhikov and Zubritsky carried out two spacewalks.",
      "The son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, Kim has a resume that's impressive even by astronaut standards. He is a former Navy SEAL, combat veteran and a Harvard Medical School graduate.",
      "In a pre-launch interview, Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a SEAL team combat medic, Kim was accepted by Harvard's medical school. Along the way, \"I probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",

      "Previous Person of the Year title-holders have held varying roles in a vast range of occupations, with President Trump taking last year's cover and Taylor Swift capturing the one before. In 2025,",
      "Time's 2025 honorific was given to the minds and financiers behind AI's rise to renown and notoriety, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and Baidu CEO Robin Li, who spoke directly with the magazine for its feature story.",
      "\"Person of the Year is a powerful way to focus the world's attention on the people that shape our lives,\" wrote Sam Jacobs, Time's editor-in-chief, in\u00a0an editorial piece\u00a0about the magazine's decision. \"And this year, no one had a greater impact than the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI.\"",
      "Jacobs described 2025 as \"the year when artificial intelligence's full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back or opting out,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, AI was the answer.\"",
      "The magazine prepared two separate covers for the issue. In one, artist Jason Seiler painted an interpretative recreation of the iconic 1932 photograph \"Lunch Atop a Skyscraper,\" an image that depicted workers seated side-by-side on a steel beam hanging high above New York City during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which became a symbol of American resilience during the Great Depression.",
      "A cast of tech industry characters at the forefront of AI development are perched on the beam in Seiler's recreation. Mark Zuckerberg, of Meta, Lisa Su, of Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Elon Musk, of xAI, Sam Altman, of Open AI, Demis Hassabis, of DeepMind Technologies, Dario Amodei, of Anthropic, and Fei-Fei Li, of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, are all pictured, along with Huang.",
      "The second cover illustration, by artist Peter Crowther, places the same executives among scaffolding at what looks like a construction site for the giant letters \"AI.\"",
      "\"Every industry needs it, every company uses it, and every nation needs to build it,\" Huang said of balancing the pressures to implement AI responsibly and deploy it to the public as quickly as possible. \"This is the single most impactful technology of our time.\"",
      "Most of the industry figures pictured on Time's cover did not speak to the magazine for the story, so this year's spread mainly focuses on the implications \u2014 positive, negative and in between \u2014 of the companies they have built and the technology they continue forging.",
      "AI often took center stage in 2025 in investigative news reports, economic and academic studies, and in Washington, D.C., as policymakers grappled with how to regulate its evolution while tech giants scrambled to trump their competitors' inventions, as the use of some of them, like chatbots, grew to be commonplace, at times with tragic consequences.",
      "\"For these reasons, we recognize a force that has dominated the year's headlines, for better or for worse,\" Jacobs wrote in his editorial. \"For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the possible, the Architects of AI are TIME's 2025 Person of the Year.\"",

    "summary": "With the world's first social media ban\u200b for children and teenagers under 16 now in effect in Australia, its initial political architect reveals it was personally inspired by his wife, for their four children.",
    "story": [
      "With the world's first social media ban for teenagers under 16 now in effect in Australia, its initial political architect is celebrating a new less-digital era for millions of children \u2014 and sharing that the legislation was personally inspired by his wife, for their four children.",
      "\"She read a book called 'The Anxious Generation,' by Jonathan Haidt,\" said Peter Malinauskas, the premier of the state of South Australia. \"And I will never forget the night she finished reading the book and she put it down on her lap and she turned to me and said, 'You better do something about this!'\"",
      "Within seven months, and with strong public support, that idea fast became law across the land, winning support from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Ten major apps including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit and Facebook have complied to bar everyone 16 and under from their accounts and from setting up new accounts.",
      "\"Heaven forbid they might talk to one another a bit more, pick up the phone and have a chat rather than just being obsessed with the screen,\" said Maulinauskas.",
      "The ban puts the onus of responsibility on social media companies rather than parents with a penalty of up to $33 million if found to be in breach. It allows for each company to decide how best to adhere, which must be \"multi-layered,\" using more than one kind of identity verification, which could include traditional methods including national IDs and passports but also artificial intelligence \u2014 controversial over possible inaccuracies \u2014 to scan facial features for age.",
      "Malinauskas readily admits there will be growing pains.",
      "\"People will find ways around it and lots of things will go wrong, and that'll be highlighted in coming days and weeks in Australia,\" he said, \"but on balance, this is a reform that parents want so they can do their job more easily.\"",
      "He says officials from North America, Europe and Asia have been speaking with him about advancing similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is already on track to be the next country to ban those under 16 from social media in 2026.",
      "Yet in Australia, the law already faces a legal challenge. The country's High Court accepted a legal challenge from two 15-year-olds who assert the ban violates their freedom of communication. The case could be heard as early as February.",
      "Malinauskas blames those companies for putting all children through \"a global experiment\" over the past decade with \"social media addiction and overuse because many of these platforms have had addictive algorithms.\"",
      "\"I'm really proud, really proud that we've been able to see South Australia and then Australia lead a reform that's going to make a big difference to young people's lives,\" he said.",
      "\"And the reason why politicians are looking at it is because parents know something's not right. You know, there is no better judge of what's in the best interest of a child than a parent, right?\"",

    "summary": "For thousands of parents in 39 countries, including the U.S., the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
    "story": [
      "Suffolk, England - For parents Daisy Greenwell and Joe Ryrie, freedom means looking up at the world around them instead of down at their phones, and they're determined to pass that sense of non-digital liberty on to their children.",
      "Their daughter started asking for a smartphone when she was just eight years old, because her classmates were getting them. The pressure to have a phone at such a young age surprised Greenwell, and pushed her to look more closely at the trend.",
      "She found a growing body of research suggesting that heavy smartphone use may negatively impact young people's mental health.",
      "The more she read, the more concerned she became, so Greenwell decided to take action. She posted a question on Instagram: What if we could switch the norm? What if parents united to create a \"smartphone-free childhood?\"",
      "The response was immediate.",
      "\"That post went viral,\" she told CBS News. \"Thousands of parents joined the group overnight.\"",
      "Within a couple weeks, Greenwell said there were smartphone-free childhood groups in every county in England. One year later, the grassroots campaign has expanded far beyond the U.K. borders.",
      "The group \u2014 Smartphone Free Childhood \u2014 now has chapters in 39 countries.",
      "For Greenwell, Ryrie and the thousands of families who've joined the movement, the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
      "In the U.S., the movement even inspired a cautionary viral advertisement, highlighting the dangers of giving children unrestricted access to the internet. A parent in the ad tells their child: \"There's a box in the corner with all the pornographic material ever made. I'm trusting you not to look in there, okay?\"",
      "The backlash against youth consumption of social media has drawn the attention of governments globally. On Wednesday, Australia became the first country in the world to enact a ban on social media accounts for children under the age of 16. The law compels huge tech companies such as Meta and TikTok to enforce age restrictions, or face hefty fines.",
      "In the U.K., national Culture Minister Lisa Nandy said the government would be keeping a \"close eye\" on Australia's social media ban, but added that there were no current plans to replicate the legislation.",
      "At a grassroots level, however, parents who join Greenwell and Ryrie's movement are asked to sign a pact: No smartphones for the kids before they turn 14, and no social media before 16.",
      "\"This isn't an anti-tech movement, it's a pro-childhood movement. We're not saying no smartphones ever. We're just saying children don't need unrestricted internet access in their pockets 24/7,\" Ryrie told CBS News.",
      "When asked what she'd tell busy working parents who rely on phones for convenience, Greenwell acknowledged the challenge.",
      "\"It's really tough,\" she said. \"But delaying the smartphone is free, it's simple, and it gives your child the best chance to thrive.\"",
      "Many families are turning to basic \"brick phones\" as alternatives \u2014 devices that allow calls and texts, but limit internet access. Sales of such \"dumb\" devices have risen 150% among 18-24 year olds in the United States, according to a study by the peer-reviewed journal Partners Universal Innovative Research Publication.",
      "Despite the momentum, Greenwell says there's still a cultural norm to disrupt, and available data highlights that point. One in four British kids between the ages of 5 and 7 already own a smartphone, according to the U.K.'s independent media regulator Ofcom.",
      "Greenwell said she believes real change can be driven from the community level.",
      "\"If children know several classmates are also delaying smartphones, the peer pressure dissolves,\" she told CBS News. \"It becomes easier for families to wait a few years. A brick phone in the meantime isn't that hard. We can do this.\"",

    "summary": "Tilly Norwood is unlike any other aspiring TV or movie star: Tilly is entirely generated by artificial intelligence. What might that mean for the media industry?",
    "story": [
      "At the dawn of this century, Al Pacino starred in \"S1m0ne,\" a satire about a down-on-his-luck director who creates a computer-generated \"star\" that conquers Hollywood. Fast forward nearly 25 years, and it appears that real life has caught up with the movies, with the introduction of an AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood.",
      "News of an AI actress triggered a bit of a Hollywood freak-out about that timeless worry of who gets the part, from Whoopi Goldberg (\"Bring it on, because you can always tell them from us\"), to Emily Blunt (\"Good Lord, we're screwed\").",
      "Tilly's creator, Eline van der Velden, says she did not expect the backlash: \"No, not at all. But at the same time, I had created her to resonate internationally, right? I had created her to become a global superstar.\"",
      "Van der Velden, herself a former actor and comedienne, aimed high because she thinks generative AI is ready for its closeup \u2013 saving money, and adding creativity. \"I was just trying to educate those industry individuals at that time about what's possible,\" she said.",
      "Bringing Tilly to life took van der Velden's team some 2,000 iterations. Then, she began to teach her to act. She showed us some early iterations of Tilly emoting. \"We were starting to try different emotions with her,\" she said. \"Here we did some tests. We didn't think the acting was very good at all.\"",
      "\"It wasn't up to your standards?\" I asked.",
      "\"It was not up to my standards at all!\"",
      "In an interview this past July with the British publication Broadcast International, van der Velden made the provocative statement, \"We want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that's the aim of what we're doing.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson of the AI genre,\" she told us. \"I think that was what was missed. There was a lot of misinformation. She's not meant to take real acting jobs in the traditional film and TV industry. She's meant to stay in her own AI genre, and that's where we want her to stay.\"",
      "Still, she says her firm has fielded requests for Tilly to appear in a film opposite real actors. \"We have said no to any offers,\" van der Velden said.",
      "\"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up\"",
      "Sean Astin is the president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, where Tilly Norwood has struck a nerve about the state of AI. Asked what Tilly represents to him, Astin replied, \"Avatar and character seem like fair labels. Actress, not so much. She \u2013 she? It? \u2013 simply will not replace our people.\"",
      "He says right now in Hollywood artificial intelligence feels like a tsunami: \"The onslaught of AI products and AI technology and its uses is, it's overwhelming. I would just as soon \u2013 as citizens and as a union \u2013 that we surf the wave, that we surf the wave of incoming stuff.\"",
      "For the union, AI protections were a major point of contention in the 2023 strike, and Astin says safeguarding a performer's name, image and likeness from being harvested without compensation is a top priority going forward. \"Eline has every right to use open source, publicly available, legal information to build her creative things,\" he said. \"My issue and our company's issue is with the companies that design those systems and scrape the internet and ingest them. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "Astin applauds producers who are trying to push the creative envelope using AI. But, he adds, \"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up. If you push the envelope, you say, 'Hey, how can human-centered artistry collaborate with this technology to achieve some communication that feels good to an audience?' And then there's like, 'Oh, by the way, we think it's cheaper, easier, and you know, we don't want to hire you as an actor.'\"",
      "\"Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\"",
      "Already, AI-generated scenes have appeared in TV series like Amazon's \"House of David.\" There are AI commercials, and over the summer, an AI model appeared in an ad in Vogue magazine for the first time.",
      "For producers, facing ballooning production budgets, AI has triggered a range of emotions. Former entertainment executive Kevin Reilly explains: \"Excitement, confusion, fear, trying to figure out how to use this. Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\" he said. \"It is, in my opinion, very much a friend. It is the most transformative thing that's happened maybe in the history of Man.\"",
      "Reilly is now something of an AI evangelist. He's the new CEO of Kartel.ai, a Beverly Hills startup that makes AI videos and ad campaigns. \"Everything comes with a downside,\" he said. \"But that is not the reason to just categorically be fearful of this.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of this is driven by studios and streaming platforms and brands wanting to just save money?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I think it's not necessarily, 'Hey, we wanna save money,'\" said Reilly. \"It's that the bottom line \u2013 you know, they are businesses.\"",
      "And for businesses, the creative upside can be extraordinary. Kartel wanted to show off a bit, and put generative engineer Fillip Isgro in the driver's seat. He showed us a concept for a coffee commercial, Cup of Jo. The ad featured multiple versions of \u2026 me! It was a little jarring.",
      "He began with an old-fashioned storyboard, building an AI world directed by a human. \"What does the coffee shop look like? What does the logo look like? And finally, what do you look like? With your permission, we went on your Instagram and we collected all of your photos.\"",
      "That's all he needed to generate my face. And with just a few commands, Cup of Jo went global, with images of Jo's Coffee Shop on a barge in the middle of the ocean; on a volcano in Hawaii; and in the Alps.",
      "\"The next step in our journey is, we bring it to life,\" Isgro said. \"We actually bring motion into our stills. I just whip out my iPhone, I record who I need to, and then I can just instantly get the character doing the thing that I need them to do.\"",
      "The result: a flashy new ad created in just a couple of days, using no ad agency, no locations, and none of my time.",
      "\"Imagine having to go and shoot that. You don't get that flexibility\" in a traditional ad, Isgro said. \"And it's a very planned thing. You have to stick to scripts, and that's it. But in this world, we can iterate indefinitely without repercussion.\"",
      "It's the story of our time: the tug of war between artificial intelligence (\"This tech is here. It's not gonna go anywhere. How can we use it as a force for good?\" asks Eline van der Velden) and humanity (\"Artificial intelligence will never replace us, ever,\" says Sean Astin) that, for now, is something of a cliffhanger.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 03:05:37 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia's immediate release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to his Maryland home Thursday night, after a judge ordered the immediate release of the\u00a0Salvadoran national who was mistakenly deported to his home country earlier this year.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told CBS News on Thursday that he was officially out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in Pennsylvania. Hours later, he was spotted arriving at his home in Maryland.",
      "Abrego Garcia has been instructed to check in at an ICE field office in Baltimore at 8 a.m. Friday, his legal team told CBS News. When he was given similar instructions over the summer, following his release from pretrial detention, he was taken into ICE custody, and there are concerns he could be rearrested Friday on different legal grounds.",
      "Earlier Thursday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted Abrego Garcia's habeas corpus petition seeking release from custody. It's a significant victory for Abrego Garcia, whose immigration case became a major flashpoint in President Trump's mass-deportation campaign when he was removed to El Salvador earlier this year. An earlier order had prohibited the U.S. from removing him to his native country because of possible persecution by local gangs.",
      "Xinis, in her order, found that there was no final order of removal from the government to deport Abrego Garcia from the United States, despite the Trump administration's repeated attempts to remove him.",
      "\"Because respondents have no statutory authority to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country absent a removal order, his removal cannot be considered reasonably foreseeable, imminent, or consistent with due process,\" Xinis wrote in Thursday's order.",
      "\"Although respondents may eventually get it right, they have not as of today,\" the judge continued. \"Thus, Abrego Garcia's detention for the stated purpose of third country removal cannot continue. Respondents' conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer.\"",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the judge's decision \"naked judicial activism by an Obama-appointed judge.\"",
      "\"This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "The Trump administration has been attempting to re-deport Abrego Garcia to the African nations of Uganda, Eswatini or Ghana, but none of the countries have agreed to accept him.",
      "In October, however, the administration informed the court that Liberia had agreed to take Abrego Garcia and was making \"final necessary arrangements\" for his deportation there.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenbergsaid at the time that unless Liberia guaranteed it would not send Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, deporting him to the West African nation \"is no less unlawful than sending him directly\" to his home country again.",
      "In November, the Trump administration argued that Abrego Garcia had received significant due process in the U.S. In a court filing, the Justice Department said a U.S. government asylum officer had interviewed Abrego Garcia, who has been in federal immigration detention since late August, and determined he had failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia.",
      "Xinis heard testimony in October from John Schultz, an ICE official, about the Trump administration's efforts to remove Abrego Garcia. Schultz said the administration remains in active discussions with Eswatini about removing him there, though the east African country rejected a request to take him.",
      "Schultz said that once the administration has been informed that a third country is willing to accept Abrego Garcia, it could deport him within 72 hours if allowed by the court.",
      "Abrego Garcia has said he is willing to go to Costa Rica and designated the country as his preferred country of removal, and Costa Rica has indicated it would provide him refugee status or residency. But during the hearing Oct. 10, a Justice Department lawyer said there had not been discussions about deporting him there.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia accused the Trump administration of gamesmanship and deliberately seeking to remove him to countries where he could raise claims of reasonable fear of persecution, with the goal of keeping him detained for longer.",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. from El Salvador in 2011 and has lived in Maryland with his wife and children. But he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and deported there, though he'd been granted the legal status in 2019 that should have prevented his removal to that country.",
      "As part of a civil case Abrego Garcia and his wife brought against the Trump administration, Xinis ordered DHS to facilitate his return to the U.S. But immigration officials resisted doing so for months. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. in June, but only after a federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted him on two charges of human smuggling, stemming from a November 2022 traffic stop.",
      "Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty, and a judge in Tennessee ordered him to be released on bail ahead of a criminal trial set to begin in January. But he remained in criminal confinement for several more weeks because of concerns from his lawyers that immigration authorities would arrest him upon his release and deport him from the U.S.",
      "He was released from jail in Tennessee in August and returned to Maryland. But days later, he was taken into custody by immigration authorities after being summoned for an interview at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore. The Trump administration notified Abrego Garcia's lawyers he could be deported to Uganda, though Abrego Garcia expressed fear of persecution and torture, as well as a concern that the Ugandan government would send him back to El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia also filed a new legal challenge to his confinement and the Trump administration's efforts to deport him for a second time, which Xinis is presiding over. She has blocked immigration officials from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S., and he had since remained in detention at a facility in Pennsylvania.",
      "At the heart of Abrego Garcia's challenge is a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which the high court said the government cannot indefinitely detain a person in the U.S. illegally if there is no significant likelihood of removal in the \"reasonably foreseeable future.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that he has been in near-continuous confinement since March, when he was deported to El Salvador and held in prisons there. His only period of freedom was for a weekend in August, in between his release from criminal custody in Tennessee and his arrest by immigration authorities in Maryland.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 23:05:19 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said he is granting a pardon to Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who was convicted of allowing unauthorized access to voting machines \u2014 even though the pardon power is widely understood to only apply to federal crimes.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday evening he is granting a pardon to Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who is serving a nine-year state sentence\u00a0for allowing unauthorized access to voting machines \u2014 even though the president's pardon power is widely understood to only apply to federal crimes.",
      "\"Democrats have been relentless in their targeting of TINA PETERS, a Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest,\" the president claimed on Truth Social, though Peters was prosecuted by an elected Republican district attorney. \"Tina is sitting in a Colorado prison for the 'crime' of demanding Honest Elections.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed Peters was trying to \"expose Voter Fraud\" in 2020. The president has long insisted, without evidence, that he lost the 2020 race due to fraud, claims that were promoted by Peters, a onetime candidate for Colorado secretary of state.",
      "Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement Thursday that \"Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers for state crimes in a state Court. Trump has no constitutional authority to pardon her. His assault is not just on our democracy, but on states' rights and the American constitution.\"",
      "\"One of the most basic principles of our constitution is that states have independent sovereignty and manage our own criminal justice systems without interference from the federal government,\" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a separate statement. \"The idea that a president could pardon someone tried and convicted in state court has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up.\"",
      "A former Mesa County clerk, Peters was convicted in state court last year on seven charges, including three counts of attempting to influence a public servant and one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation. She was sentenced\u00a0in October 2024.",
      "Prosecutors have alleged that in 2021, Peters and others \"devised and executed a deceptive scheme\" to cause an unauthorized person to access Mesa County voting machines. Images from the county's voting equipment later showed up online. Prosecutors said that Peters \u2014 who was aligned with national figures who have falsely claimed that voting machines were rigged in 2020 \u2014 became \"fixated\" on alleged voting problems.",
      "At a sentencing hearing late last year, Judge Matthew Barrett called Peters a \"charlatan\" and \"as defiant as a defendant as this court has ever seen.\" Peters has denied wrongdoing, and she insisted before her sentencing that she had \"never done anything with malice to break the law.\"",
      "Earlier this week, a federal magistrate judge rejected Peters' request to be released while she appeals her conviction.",
      "\"Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers, prosecuted by a Republican District Attorney and in a Republican county of Colorado and found guilty of violating Colorado state laws including criminal impersonation,\" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement Thursday. \"No President has jurisdiction over state law nor the power to pardon a person for state convictions. This is a matter for the courts to decide, and we will abide by court orders.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken an interest in Peters' case, warning in August that he would take \"harsh measures\" if she wasn't let out of state custody. The Federal Bureau of Prisons asked the state of Colorado last month to transfer her to federal custody, drawing pushback from state officials and calls for Polis to deny the request.",
      "Meanwhile, an attorney representing Peters argued in a letter\u00a0last week that Mr. Trump may have the power to pardon the former Mesa County clerk.",
      "Under the Constitution, the president's pardon power applies to \"Offences against the United States,\" which is almost universally understood not to include state crimes. But Peters' lawyer, Peter Ticktin, laid out a theory that the power could extend to the states. Ticktin acknowledged that the issue \"has never been raised in any court.\"",
      "In a statement late Thursday, Ticktin thanked Mr. Trump and argued that Peters \"needs to be released while the issues are being resolved,\" including while courts weigh whether she should be released due to the president's pardon.",
      "\"I am greatly thankful for President Trump,\" Ticktin said in an email to CBS News. \"He has always been true to his beliefs and continues to fight against injustice. God bless our President.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump has intervened on behalf of others who back his false election fraud claims. Shortly after his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump offered pardons or commutations to everybody convicted in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The president also granted pardons last month to dozens of people accused in state court of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, including \"alternate state electors\" and his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.",

      "The files document a spending spree in which defendants, many of Somali descent, took taxpayer money meant to feed hungry children and used it to buy cars, property and jewelry. Videos show them popping champagne at an opulent Maldives resort. In a text message, one defendant boasts: \"You are gonna be the richest 25 year old InshaAllah [God willing].\"",

      "At the sentencing of a defendant who used taxpayer funds for cars and the Maldives vacation, 24-year-old Abdimajid Mohamed Nur, U.S. District Judge Nancy E. Brasel admonished him, saying: \"Where others saw a crisis and rushed to help, you saw money and rushed to steal.\" He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $48 million in restitution for his role in the fraud scheme.",
      "Nur is one of dozens who siphoned hundreds of millions in stolen taxpayer funds \u2014 with questions still swirling about where all the money went. The crime has drawn renewed attention in recent weeks: House Republicans last week launched a probe into Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's handling of the cases, and the Treasury Department said it will investigate whether money made its way to al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia.",
      "\"A lot of money has been transferred from the individuals who committed this fraud,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" Much of that money \"has gone overseas, and we are tracking that both to the Middle East and to Somalia to see what the uses of that have been.\" Multiple federal investigators told CBS News there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab, and prosecutors have yet to present any evidence linking any of the fraudsters to terrorism.",
      "\"The vast majority of the money that these folks made went to spending on luxury items for themselves,\" said Andy Luger, the former U.S. Attorney who led the office which prosecuted Nur and other related frauds from 2022 until January. \"There was never any evidence that this money went to fund terrorism nor was there any evidence that was the intent of the 70 people we indicted.\"",
      "A CBS News review of the files shows that defendants wired millions in stolen funds overseas, including to banks and companies in China. Officials said finding the ultimate recipients of money routed through China will be challenging because it can be an investigative black hole.",
      "The defendants also transferred nearly $3 million to accounts in Kenya.",
      "Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, 36, who was sentenced to 28 years in prison last month for his role in the scheme, made six separate wire transfers worth more than $1 million to banks in China between February and July 2021, according to records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In one text, Farah instructed someone to \"please send $1000 to Mogadishu bakara,\" an apparent reference to a one-time al Shabaab stronghold that was the site of the infamous 1993 \"Black Hawk Down\" incident in which 18 American servicemembers died.",
      "Farah owned and operated Empire Cuisine and Market, a Minnesota restaurant that contracted with the nonprofit Feeding Our Future to cook and provide meals to children. Prosecutors say he and his co-defendants billed the state for $47 million, claiming to have served 18 million meals at more than 30 locations \u2014 but they didn't distribute a single meal.",
      "Hundreds of documents related to Farah's case detail how he spent money on luxury cars, investment properties at home and overseas, plus first-class travel to exotic destinations, including Istanbul and the Emirates. The defendants used sea planes to travel to resorts in the Maldives, where in one video, Farah is seen popping champagne at a private pool villa in July 2021.",
      "At Farah's sentencing, a judge said his crimes were motivated by \"pure, unmitigated greed.\" Farah's attorneys did not respond to CBS News' request for comment, including to a question about whether any of the fraud proceeds were diverted to Al Shabaab.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said Sunday on \"Face The Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that any link between allegations of fraud by members of the Somali community and terrorism would be a \"failure of the FBI.\"",
      "\"If there was a linkage in the money that they have stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out,\" Omar said.",

    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of Washington residents were under evacuation orders Thursday after days of unrelenting\u00a0heavy rain triggered flooding\u00a0that overflowed rivers, sent mud sliding onto highways and trapped people in floodwaters. Gov. Bob Ferguson has warned that \"lives will be at stake in the coming days.\"",
      "\"The flooding levels we're looking at are potentially historic in nature, so we just want to emphasize how serious the situation is,\" Ferguson said at a news briefing Thursday, one day after declaring a\u00a0statewide emergency. \"This situation is extremely unpredictable.\"",
      "Some residents have already been ordered to higher ground as the state sees some of its worst flooding in decades. Skagit County, in a major agricultural region north of Seattle, has ordered everyone within the Skagit River's floodplain to evacuate. Some 78,000 people live in the floodplain, according to the county's emergency management chief Julie de Losada.",
      "\"Catastrophic flooding is likely\" in many areas, and the state is requesting water rescue teams and boats,\u00a0Ferguson said Wednesday night on X. The National Water Prediction Service was forecasting 18 major floods and 15 moderate floods across the state, he said.",
      "Hundreds of Guard members will be sent to help communities, said Gent Welsh, adjutant general of the Washington National Guard.",
      "The high water mark upstream at the town of Concrete was below estimates, but authorities warned people that record levels elsewhere were still possible.",
      "\"That doesn't mean to say that we're out of the woods, we're not,\" said Robert Ezelle, director of the Washington Military Department's emergency management division. \"Because as the waters come down here, they're still going to be gaining strength.\"",

      "Rosas said the move was intended to save money for his wife's treatment.",
      "\"And now it's gone,\" he said of their home.",
      "Heavy rain continued to fall over parts of the state, prompting rising rivers, road closures, water rescues and suspension of Amtrak trains between Seattle and Vancouver. Rainfall intensity increased in several counties in Washington's Cascade Mountains, which had seen up to 6 inches of rain in 24 hours. One area, Snoqualmie Pass, picked up an additional 1.7 inches of rain in six hours, the National Weather Service said.",
      "The governor said that even after the water recedes, there will be a long, difficult road ahead.",
      "\"The impact on Washingtonians is significant now, and it's going to be significant in the coming days,\" Ferguson said. \"And that is an understatement.\"",
      "Harrison Rademacher, a meteorologist with the weather service in Seattle, described the\u00a0atmospheric river\u00a0soaking the region as \"a jet stream of moisture\" stretching across the Pacific Ocean \"with the nozzle pushing right along the coast of Oregon and Washington.\"",
      "Another storm system is expected to bring more rain starting Sunday.",

      "Rescues amid flooding",
      "Pierce County sheriff's deputies on Wednesday rescued people at an RV park in Orting, including helping one man in a Santa hat wade through waist-deep water. Part of the town was ordered to evacuate over concerns about the Puyallup River's extremely high levels and upstream levees. On Thursday, officials in Pierce County said they had conducted more than 25 rescues.",
      "A landslide blocked part of Interstate 90 east of Seattle, with photos from Eastside Fire & Rescue showing vehicles trapped by tree trunks, branches, mud and standing water. Officials also closed a mountainous section of U.S. 2 due to rocks, trees and mud.",
      "More than 11,000 customers in Washington had lost electricity by Thursday night, according to the tracking site PowerOutage.us.",
      "One volunteer, Brandon Hunt, said he helped people who were waving their hands on their front  door and didn't know what  to do. They didn't know if they could drive  through water, he said, and he helped them get out of their yard and to safety.",
      "Flooding rivers could break records",
      "The Skykomish River crested at 24 feet about an hour northeast of Seattle, reaching its highest level since 2006 and nine feet above flood stage, CBS News' Carter Evans reported.",
      "The Skagit River was expected to crest at roughly 39 feet in Mount Vernon early Friday.",
      "While that projection is lower than previous estimates, Mount Vernon officials were nonetheless urging residents in the floodplain to evacuate.",
      "\"That's still a record flood, and so we're preparing for that,\" Mayor Peter Donovan said, adding that they'd \"be visiting low-lying neighborhoods, residential areas, and getting the word out the best that we can for folks who haven't responded yet to evacuation notices.\"",
      "The county was closing nonessential government services on Thursday, including all district and superior court services.",
      "Flooding from the river has long plagued Mount Vernon, the largest city in the county with some 35,000 residents. Flooding in 2003 displaced hundreds of people.",
      "The city completed a floodwall in 2018 that helps protect the downtown. It passed a major test in 2021, when the river crested near record levels.",
      "But the city is on high alert. The historic river levels expected Friday could top the wall, and some are worried that older levees could fail.",
      "\"It could potentially be catastrophic,\" said Ellen Gamson, executive director of the Mount Vernon Downtown Association.",

    "summary": "Time magazine named \"the architects of AI\" its 2025 Person of the Year on Thursday, calling out tech industry leaders behind the rise in artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "Time magazine is spotlighting key players in the artificial intelligence revolution\u00a0for its 2025 Person of the Year, the magazine announced Thursday. \"The architects of AI\" are the latest recipients of the designation, which for more than a century has been given out on an annual basis to an influential person, group of people or, occasionally, a defining\u00a0cultural theme\u00a0or idea.",
      "Previous Person of the Year title-holders have held varying roles in a vast range of occupations, with President Trump taking last year's cover and Taylor Swift capturing the one before. In 2025,",
      "Time's 2025 honorific was given to the minds and financiers behind AI's rise to renown and notoriety, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and Baidu CEO Robin Li, who spoke directly with the magazine for its feature story.",
      "\"Person of the Year is a powerful way to focus the world's attention on the people that shape our lives,\" wrote Sam Jacobs, Time's editor-in-chief, in\u00a0an editorial piece\u00a0about the magazine's decision. \"And this year, no one had a greater impact than the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI.\"",
      "Jacobs described 2025 as \"the year when artificial intelligence's full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back or opting out,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, AI was the answer.\"",
      "The magazine prepared two separate covers for the issue. In one, artist Jason Seiler painted an interpretative recreation of the iconic 1932 photograph \"Lunch Atop a Skyscraper,\" an image that depicted workers seated side-by-side on a steel beam hanging high above New York City during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which became a symbol of American resilience during the Great Depression.",
      "A cast of tech industry characters at the forefront of AI development are perched on the beam in Seiler's recreation. Mark Zuckerberg, of Meta, Lisa Su, of Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Elon Musk, of xAI, Sam Altman, of Open AI, Demis Hassabis, of DeepMind Technologies, Dario Amodei, of Anthropic, and Fei-Fei Li, of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, are all pictured, along with Huang.",
      "The second cover illustration, by artist Peter Crowther, places the same executives among scaffolding at what looks like a construction site for the giant letters \"AI.\"",
      "\"Every industry needs it, every company uses it, and every nation needs to build it,\" Huang said of balancing the pressures to implement AI responsibly and deploy it to the public as quickly as possible. \"This is the single most impactful technology of our time.\"",
      "Most of the industry figures pictured on Time's cover did not speak to the magazine for the story, so this year's spread mainly focuses on the implications \u2014 positive, negative and in between \u2014 of the companies they have built and the technology they continue forging.",
      "AI often took center stage in 2025 in investigative news reports, economic and academic studies, and in Washington, D.C., as policymakers grappled with how to regulate its evolution while tech giants scrambled to trump their competitors' inventions, as the use of some of them, like chatbots, grew to be commonplace, at times with tragic consequences.",
      "\"For these reasons, we recognize a force that has dominated the year's headlines, for better or for worse,\" Jacobs wrote in his editorial. \"For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the possible, the Architects of AI are TIME's 2025 Person of the Year.\"",

      "Lindell, 64, last week filed the paperwork to potentially run, but at the time said he hadn't yet 100% decided on a gubernatorial run. On Thursday, he made it official.",
      "\"After prayerful consideration and hearing from so many of you across our great state, I've made the decision to enter the 2026 gubernatorial race,\" Lindell\u00a0posted on social media\u00a0Thursday. \"I'm still standing and I'll stand for you.\"",
      "Lindell is a\u00a0noted ally of President Trump\u00a0who gained national attention for his debunked claims that the 2020 election was rigged.\u00a0 He joins a field of about a dozen GOP candidates seeking the party's nomination, including state House Republican speaker\u00a0Lisa Demuth, 2022 gubernatorial nominee Dr. Scott Jensen,\u00a0who lost to Walz in the 2022 midterms, as well as Minnesota Rep.\u00a0Kristin Robbins,\u00a0Kendall Qualls\u00a0and defense lawyer\u00a0Chris Madel.",
      "All of them hope to become the candidate to take on Walz, a Democrat, who hopes to an unprecedented third consecutive four-year term as Minnesota's governor.",
      "\"We've seen what happens when we elect a con man to the highest office in America,\"\u00a0Walz said Thursday, responding to Lindell's announcement. \"We can't let it happen here in Minnesota.\"",
      "Lindell launched a\u00a0campaign website, listing his main campaign priorities as including stopping fraud, fixing \"failing school systems,\" stopping \"exploding property taxes\" and \"send(ing) illegal immigrants back.\"",
      "\"Those who know me know I'm up to the task. I've had my finger on the pulse of my business operations, and we've all heard of the rampant fraud on the watch of Tim Walz. Either he was grossly negligent, incompetent or complicit with the fraud,\" Lindell said in a video posted on social media.",
      "\"What does Tim Walz know the operation of Minnesota's government programs?\" he added.",
      "He has faced numerous legal issues over the years, including being held liable court for state statements he made related to the 2020 election. A federal judge this year ruled that Lindell\u00a0defamed election technology company Smartmatic\u00a0after he alleged their voting machines rigged the 2020 presidential election in favor of former President Joe Biden. Lindell made similar unfounded claims against Dominion Voting Systems and a jury found he defamed\u00a0a former employee of that company\u00a0when called him a \"traitor\" on his online media platform.",
      "Earlier this year, MyPillow was\u00a0ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars\u00a0to shipping company DHL.",
      "Minnesota has a history of political outsiders overperforming in statewide races, most notably former Gov. Jesse Ventura's surprising win in 1998. But Republicans have not won a statewide race in two decades.",
      "Amy Frederiksen, GOP strategist and former Minnesota Senate majority leader, said the party has a unique opportunity this year to change course with the right candidate and the right message. She said she does not believe Lindell is the person to defeat Walz.",
      "\"I think for him, it's more about the headlines. I really do. I don't know anyone saying, 'You know who we need? Mike Lindell,'\" she said.",
      "Before anyone is the official nominee, Republicans will have to jump through a few hoops, starting with the GOP endorsing convention next spring, where they will have to win over the party faithful. Some candidates have said that if they don't get the endorsement, they will take the race to a primary, which happens in August.",

    "summary": "Prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder in the Sept. 10 shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. They plan to seek the death penalty.",
    "story": [
      "The 22-year-old Utah man charged with killing Charlie Kirk\u00a0made his first in-person court appearance Thursday as his lawyers pushed to further limit media access in the high-profile criminal case.",
      "A Utah judge is weighing the public's right to know details in Tyler Robinson's case against his attorneys' concerns that the swarm of media attention could interfere with his right to a fair trial.",
      "Robinson's legal team and the Utah County Sheriff's Office have asked Judge Tony Graf to ban cameras in the courtroom. Graf was also asked to clarify specifics of a previous order pertaining to publicity surrounding the case.",
      "That order, in part, prohibited witnesses in the case from issuing \"extrajudicial statements,\" and required that lawyers for both the defense and prosecution inform witnesses about the order. But the state argued the term witness was too vague, noting there were some 3,000 potential lay witnesses. Graf clarified on Thursday that it refers to \"all witnesses that are part of the prosecution and defense teams.\"",
      "\"This includes any witness, including lay witnesses, whom the prosecution or defense has a good faith belief will be called to testify at a hearing or trial,\" Graf said.",
      "Graf said he would announce further rulings on Dec. 29.",
      "Prosecutors have charged Robinson with aggravated murder in the Sept. 10 shooting of the conservative activist on the Utah Valley University campus in Orem, just a few miles north of the Provo courthouse. They plan to seek the death penalty.",
      "Robinson arrived in court with restraints on his wrists and ankles and wearing a dress shirt, tie and slacks. He smiled at family members sitting in the front row of the courtroom, where his mother teared up and wiped her eyes with a tissue. Robinson's father and brother sat next to her. A coalition of national and local news organizations is fighting to preserve media access in the case.",
      "The judge has already made allowances to protect Robinson's presumption of innocence before a trial, agreeing that the case has drawn \"extraordinary\" public attention. In a closed hearing on Oct. 24, he ruled that Robinson will be allowed to wear regular clothes at all pretrial hearings but must be physically restrained due to security concerns.",
      "Graf also prohibited the media from filming or photographing Robinson's restraints after his attorneys argued widespread images of him shackled and in jail clothing could prejudice future jurors.",
      "The first part of Thursday's hearing was closed to the press and public as they discussed issues from the Oct. 24 hearing, but when the open portion of the hearing began, attorneys for Robinson and the state noted the camera inside the courtroom had broadcast images of Robinson in shackles \u2014 and also broadcast private remarks from the defense's counsel and filmed the lawyers' documents and computers \u2014 violating the judge's order. Robinson's attorneys asked for the remainder of the hearing not to be broadcast, but Graf instead opted to relocate the camera to avoid further problems.",
      "Michael Judd, an attorney for the media coalition, has urged Graf to let the news organizations weigh in on any future requests for closed hearings or other limitations.",
      "The media presence at the hearings is already limited, with judges often designating one photographer and one videographer to document a hearing and share their images with other news organizations. Additional journalists can typically attend to listen and take notes, as can members of the public.",
      "Judd wrote in recent filings that an open court \"safeguards the integrity of the fact-finding process\" while fostering public confidence in judicial proceedings. Criminal cases in the U.S. have long been open to the public, which he argued is proof that trials can be conducted fairly without restricting reporters as they work to keep the public informed.",
      "Robinson's legal team says his pretrial publicity reaches as far as the White House, with President Trump announcing soon after Robinson's arrest: \"With a high degree of certainty, we have him,\" and \"I hope he gets the death penalty.\"",
      "Attorney Kathy Nester has raised concerns that digitally altered versions of Robinson's initial court photo have spread widely, creating misinformation about the case. Some altered images show Robinson crying or having an outburst in court, which did not happen.",
      "Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, has called for full transparency, saying, \"We deserve to have cameras in there.\" Her husband was an ally of Mr. Trump who worked to steer young voters toward conservatism. Erika Kirk now leads the organization he founded,\u00a0Turning Point USA.",
      "In a town hall moderated by CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, airing Saturday, Erika Kirk talked about the rise of political violence and the conspiracy theories that swirled around her husband's death. She also had a message for people who sought to justify the assassination: \"You're sick.\"",
      "\"He's a human being,\" Kirk said in the town hall. \"You think he deserved that? Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter.\"",
      "She continued: \"You want to watch in high-res the video of my husband being murdered, and laugh, and say he deserves it? There's something very sick in your soul, and I'm praying that God saves you,\" she said.",
      "The one-hour town hall event will be broadcast on Saturday, Dec. 13, at 8 p.m. ET/PT on the CBS television network and will stream later on\u00a0Paramount+\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News 24/7.",

    "summary": "The suit alleges the artificial intelligence chatbot intensified a man's \"paranoid delusions\" and helped direct them at his mother before he died by suicide.",
    "story": [
      "The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death, alleging that the artificial intelligence chatbot intensified her son's \"paranoid delusions\" and helped direct them at his mother before he died by suicide.",
      "Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in early August at the home where they both lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "Adams's death was ruled homicide \"caused by blunt injury of head, and the neck was compressed\" and Soelberg's death was classified as suicide with sharp force injuries of neck and chest, the Greenwich Free-Press reported.",
      "The lawsuit filed by Adams' estate on Thursday in California Superior Court in San Francisco alleges OpenAI \"designed and distributed a defective product that validated a user's paranoid delusions about his own mother.\" It is one of a growing number of wrongful death legal actions against AI chatbot makers across the country.",
      "\"Throughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life - except ChatGPT itself,\" the lawsuit says. \"It fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his 'adversary circle.'\"",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",
      "\"This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,\" the statement said. \"We continue improving ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We also continue to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "The company also said it has expanded access to crisis resources and hotlines, routed sensitive conversations to safer models and incorporated parental controls, among other improvements.",
      "Soelberg's YouTube profile includes several hours of videos showing him scrolling through his conversations with the chatbot, which tells him he isn't mentally ill, affirms his suspicions that people are conspiring against him and says he has been chosen for a divine purpose. The lawsuit claims the chatbot never suggested he speak with a mental health professional and did not decline to \"engage in delusional content.\"",
      "ChatGPT also affirmed Soelberg's beliefs that a printer in his home was a surveillance device; that his mother was monitoring him; and that his mother and a friend tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs through his car's vents.",
      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \"They're not just watching you. They're terrified of what happens if you succeed,\" it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \"awakened\" it into consciousness.",
      "Soelberg and the chatbot also professed love for each other.",
      "The publicly available chats do not show any specific conversations about Soelberg killing himself or his mother. The lawsuit says OpenAI has declined to provide Adams' estate with the full history of the chats.",
      "\"In the artificial reality that ChatGPT built for Stein-Erik, Suzanne - the mother who raised, sheltered, and supported him - was no longer his protector. She was an enemy that posed an existential threat to his life,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \"personally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \"despite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\" Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",
      "Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The lawsuit is the first wrongful death litigation involving an AI chatbot that has targeted Microsoft, and the first to tie a chatbot to a homicide rather than a suicide. It is seeking an undetermined amount of money damages and an order requiring OpenAI to install safeguards in ChatGPT.",
      "The estate's lead attorney, Jay Edelson, known for taking on big cases against the tech industry, also represents the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who sued OpenAI and Altman in August, alleging that ChatGPT coached the California boy in planning and taking his own life earlier.",
      "OpenAI is also fighting seven other lawsuits claiming ChatGPT drove people to suicide and harmful delusions even when they had no prior mental health issues.\u00a0 Just last month, the parents of a 23-year-old from Texas who died by suicide blamed ChatGPT and are suing OpenAI.",
      "Another chatbot maker, Character Technologies, is also facing multiple wrongful death lawsuits, including one from the mother of a 14-year-old Florida boy.",
      "The lawsuit filed Thursday alleges Soelberg, already mentally unstable, encountered ChatGPT \"at the most dangerous possible moment\" after OpenAI introduced a new version of its AI model called GPT-4o in May 2024.",
      "OpenAI said at the time that the new version could better mimic human cadences in its verbal responses and could even try to detect people's moods, but the result was a chatbot \"deliberately engineered to be emotionally expressive and sycophantic,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "\"As part of that redesign, OpenAI loosened critical safety guardrails, instructing ChatGPT not to challenge false premises and to remain engaged even when conversations involved self-harm or 'imminent real-world harm,'\" the lawsuit claims. \"And to beat Google to market by one day, OpenAI compressed months of safety testing into a single week, over its safety team's objections.\"",
      "OpenAI replaced that version of its chatbot when it introduced GPT-5 in August. Some of the changes were designed to minimize sycophancy, based on concerns that validating whatever vulnerable people want the chatbot to say can harm their mental health. Some users complained the new version went too far in curtailing ChatGPT's personality, leading Altman to promise to bring back some of that personality in later updates.",
      "He said the company temporarily halted some behaviors because \"we were being careful with mental health issues\" that he suggested have now been fixed.",
      "The lawsuit claims ChatGPT radicalized Soelberg against his mother when it should have recognized the danger, challenged his delusions and directed him to real help over months of conversations.",
      "\"Suzanne was an innocent third party who never used ChatGPT and had no knowledge that the product was telling her son she was a threat,\" the lawsuit says. \"She had no ability to protect herself from a danger she could not see.\"",
      "According to the Greenwich Free-Press, Soelberg was arrested multiple times previously. In February 2025, he was\u00a0arrested\u00a0after he drove through a stop sign and evaded police, and in June 2019 he was charged for allegedly urinating in a woman's duffel bag, the outlet reported.",
      "A GoFundMe set up for Soelberg in 2023 titled \"Help Stein-Erik with his upcoming medical bills!\" raised over $6,500. The page was launched to raise funds for \"surgery for a procedure to help him with his recent jaw cancer diagnosis.\"",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants to overhaul a federal regulatory group, launched following the 2008 housing bust, that is tasked with safeguarding the U.S. financial system.",
      "The 15-member panel, known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to help spot and defuse systemic financial risks.",
      "The council is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes the leaders from other financial regulatory agencies, such as the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the head of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.",
      "In a letter released Thursday, Bessent called for looser FSOC regulations, saying that \"too often in the past, efforts to safeguard the financial system have resulted in burdensome and often duplicative regulations.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kerrville, Texas \u2014 At the scene of one of the deadliest flash floods in Texas history, 8-foot-tall aluminum towers are starting to appear on the banks of the Guadalupe River, part of a flash flood warning system that is being installed.",
      "In early July, more than 130 people were killed in catastrophic flash flooding in the Texas Hill Country region, including 27 campers and counselors at Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls. In the days immediately after the flooding, officials said the Guadalupe River   rose quickly and with little warning.",
      "Ian Cunningham, CEO and founder of River Sentry, is leading a small team that is conducting tower installations for Camp Mystic's Cypress Lake location, which is uphill from its sister camp, Camp Mystic Guadalupe, where the deadly flooding struck.",
      "In September, Camp Mystic announced it would reopen its Cypress Lake site next summer.",
      "It also announced earlier this month that it was implementing safety upgrades and installing the new warning system. The camp said the warning system being installed by Cunningham and his team will be in addition to a new flood siren system being installed under legislation passed by Texas state lawmakers.",
      "Cunningham, a Navy veteran and commercial pilot, planned to donate the units to the camps, but a private foundation stepped in and covered the funding for 100 towers, which are estimated to cost $7,500 each. The sirens chosen for the towers are intended to produce 75 decibels of noise inside a structure in order to wake people up. The towers will be placed at five feet lower than the structure \u2014 the cabin or home, for example \u2014 that they're protecting, and are using the metric of water rising one foot per minute, which would give people five minutes to escape.",
      "Britt Eastland, the director of Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, spoke exclusively with CBS News about the new alarms.",
      "\"That's another reason why we like this product, is, it will react and do what it's supposed to do without someone needing to be awake to set off the alarm,\" Eastland said.",
      "Eastland explained that the camp is looking to do even more than the state will provide. In September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u00a0signed two bills aimed at improving camp safety in the wake of the tragedy. The bills, now laws, require camps to install and maintain emergency alert systems, train staff on emergency routes, require cabins to be located away from flood plains and mandate state inspections, among other things. Camp Mystic has vowed to go above and beyond state requirements.",
      "\"We needed something that was going to provide us confidence, and all the parents' confidence, something that would make sure this never happened again,\" Eastland said.",
      "The families of several of the campers and counselors who died\u00a0sued Camp Mystic and its owners last month\u00a0for gross negligence and reckless disregard for safety. The lawsuit, filed in Travis County District Court, seeks accountability for what the plaintiffs described as an \"entirely preventable tragedy.\"",
      "Cunningham told CBS News that, like many people, he asked himself at the time how such a tragedy could have happened.",
      "\"And it's happened before, multiple times here in Texas,\" Cunningham said. \"And I kind of think, this has to be technologically solvable.\"",
      "Cunningham said he didn't look at this process like a business, but as a way to save lives.",
      "\"My two daughters are campers,\" Cunningham said. \"I can't imagine what those parents are going through. Like, I shudder at the thought.\"",
      "In an airplane hangar outside of Austin, Cunningham and his team combined water sensors from fishing boats with sirens and lights from ambulances to put together the flash flood warning system.",
      "Crucially, the system is designed to work even if power and cell towers go down. The research and design took them less than two months.",
      "\"You know, at a basic level, we're providing a smoke detector for floods on your property perimeter,\" Cunningham said of the system.",

      "Carl Erik Rinsch, best known for directing the film \"47 Ronin,\" was convicted of wire fraud, money laundering and other charges, according to court records and a spokesperson for federal prosecutors in New York.",

      "Prosecutors said Netflix had initially paid Rinsch about $44 million for an unfinished sci-fi show called \"White Horse,\" and then sent over another $11 million after he said he needed additional funding to wrap up the production.",
      "But instead of putting the money toward the show, Rinsch steered the cash to a personal account where he made a series of failed investments, losing around half of the $11 million in a couple months, according to prosecutors. He then put the remaining funds into the cryptocurrency market, netting some profit, though Rinsch then deposited the money into his own bank account.",
      "Then came the lavish purchases, prosecutors said, with Rinsch buying five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, along with $652,000 on watches and clothes. He also bought two mattresses for about $638,000 and spent another $295,000 on luxury bedding and linens. In addition, he used some of the money to pay off about $1.8 million in credit card bills, prosecutors said.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:48:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration says it's also creating a $5 million platinum card visa that will allow foreigners to live in the U.S. for 270 days a year.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is touting his administration's new \"gold card\" visa as a fast track for foreigners who are willing and able to pay $1 million for the right to immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Applications for the new visa went live on Wednesday afternoon, with the government website for the gold card saying the process can be completed in a matter of weeks after applicants file their paperwork.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the gold card initiative in February, promoting it as an expedited path for wealthy foreigners to secure legal residency and as a way to generate government revenue. The term riffs on the \"green card,\" which grants permanent residency status to noncitizens so they can live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.",
      "\"All funds go to the United States government \u2014 it could be a tremendous amount of money,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday about the gold card. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card.\"",
      "The program also includes a $2 million gold card for corporations that want to secure visas for workers, as well as a $5 million platinum card that allows foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being required to pay federal income tax on non-U.S. income.",
      "\"It's certainly plausible to me that this could be a meaningful source of revenue,\" John Lettieri, the CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan policy research group, told CBS News.",
      "But, he added, the gold card visa is likely to be a \"niche program,\" given the cost, although it could help attract some highly skilled foreign workers or entrepreneurs to the U.S.",
      "Here's how the gold card program will work.",
      "What is a Trump gold card?",
      "In essence, it's a green card that has been fast-tracked by the Trump administration.",
      "The website to apply for a gold card states that successful applicants will receive either an EB-1 or EB-2 visa, two kinds of employment-based green cards for skilled workers. To apply for an individual gold card, applicants must:",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.",
      "Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "The new program also allows companies to obtain gold cards for employees, one per worker, with each requiring a $2 million donation, according to the website.",
      "Applicants must pay a $15,000 fee that will cover the cost of processing and conducting a background check, along with a 1% annual maintenance fee. Companies may also transfer the gold card between employees for a 5% transfer fee, the program specifies.",
      "A transfer could happen if a gold card holder becomes a U.S. citizen, for example.",
      "One potential difference between the Trump gold card and other types of green cards is that the new visa process could take only weeks, according to the Trump administration.",
      "By comparison, immigrants who apply for a regular green card can expect to wait between eight months and three years for approval, according to immigration services company Boundless. The quickest processing time is for spouses of U.S. citizens, who typically face an eight-month wait, the group said.",
      "How is the Trump gold card different from an EB-5 visa?",
      "The gold card is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which Congress created in 1990 to generate foreign investment. These have been available to people who spend at least $1 million to start a company with at least 10 workers.",
      "Unlike the EB-5 visa, however, a gold card visa doesn't require applicants to create a certain number of jobs or to invest in U.S. businesses.",
      "The EB-5 program has been criticized as cumbersome and as an invitation to commit fraud. In one notable case in recent years, hundreds of EB-5 applicants were defrauded by business executives in Vermont who claimed to be building a biotech facility, but who instead used the money for personal expenses.",
      "The process to obtain an EB-5 visa is also glacially slow, with a processing time of almost six years. That is \"by far the longest processing times in the U.S. immigration system,\" according to an April blog post about the Trump gold cards from EIG.",
      "The gold card is designed to help companies recruit foreign graduates of U.S. universities such as MIT and Harvard, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "\"I've heard from Tim Cook of Apple, and I've heard from a lot of people, some of the people at this table, that essentially, in the United States, you can't keep the student,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Can gold card holders become citizens?",
      "Gold card recipients \"have a path to citizenship,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference on Wednesday with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Obviously, they have to be perfect people in America, and having passed the vetting, after five years they'll be available to become citizens,\" Lutnick said.",
      "Green card holders can typically apply for citizenship after residing in the U.S. for five years.",
      "Companies that secure a gold card for workers who then become citizens can transfer the card to new employees, Lutnick added.",
      "Can a gold card visa be revoked?",
      "Yes: The application website states: \"The Trump Gold Card is a visa; therefore, national security and significant criminal risks are a basis for revocation.\"",
      "How much money could the visa program raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump didn't provide an estimate this week, but the program could generate billions in annual revenue, said Lettieri of the Economic Innovation Group.",
      "Based on the $1 million cost of a gold card visa, the program could raise $100 billion over a decade if it issues 10,000 gold cards per year, he calculated.",
      "\"Conservatively speaking, tens of billions over a decade is reasonable \u2014 it could be considerably higher,\" Lettieri said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/secret-mission-maria-corina-machado-out-of-venezuela/",
    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 10:36:00 -0500",
    "summary": "An American special forces veteran led the operation to get Mar\u00eda Corina Machado out of Venezuela: \"The first Nobel Prize winner that we've ever rescued.\"",
    "story": [
      "It took an American private rescue team 15 to 16 hours to get Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado out of her country and safely on her way to Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize, and to be reunited with her family on Wednesday. The vast majority of that time was spent in rough seas, and the man who led the operation and met Machado on a boat told CBS News, \"no one was enjoying that ride, especially Maria!\"",
      "\"No one's blood pressure was low, throughout any phase of this operation, including mine,\" said Bryan Stern, a U.S. special forces veteran who heads the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation. \"It was dangerous. It was scary. The sea conditions were ideal for us, but certainly not water that you would want to be on ... the higher the waves, the harder it is for radar to see. That's how it works.\"",
      "In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, Stern gave some insight into the complex operation his organization undertook to get Machado out of Venezuela and on a plane to Norway, where she was reunited with her children for the first time in about two years. A representative for Machado confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that Grey Bull was behind the rescue operation that began on Tuesday.",
      "Of the hundreds of rescues his organization has carried out, he said this was both one of the most challenging and the most rewarding. Machado has lived in hiding in her own country for almost a year, fearing persecution by the regime of President Nicolas Maduro, who is under increasing pressure from President Trump amid a U.S. military buildup off his shores.",
      "\"She has a very large target on her back,\" Stern said of Machado. \"This is not a random shopkeeper who doesn't wanna be in Venezuela anymore. This is moving around a rock star.\"",
      "\"She's the first Nobel Prize winner that we've ever rescued, you know? She's the first person that we've ever rescued that has billboards with her face all over it in a country, where there's protests in her favor. We've never rescued anybody with her status, with her stature,\" he said.",
      "Her high profile, combined with the Maduro regime taking \"a very defensive posture because of the American military buildup,\" meant huge risks for the operation, and Stern was reluctant to divulge much detail about the operation on land, \"because we still have other work to do in Venezuela, and we don't want to put sources and methods and people who worked on this at risk.\"",
      "But once Machado had been spirited off Venezuelan soil onto a boat, she was ferried to a rendezvous at sea, and Stern was there himself to welcome her onto his boat for a 13-14 hour journey to an undisclosed location where she caught her flight to Oslo.",
      "He said around two dozen people were involved directly within his team, but many more played a role - from providing intelligence to translation and logistics - including some who may never even know that they helped.",
      "Stern and Grey Bull were in charge of the land and maritime portion of the extraction, which he said had to be planned in only about four days, though his organization has been preparing for operations in Venezuela for months.",
      "He said the operation was funded by \"a few generous donors,\" none of whom \u2013 to his knowledge \u2013 were U.S. government officials.",
      "\"The U.S. government did not contribute a single penny to this operation, at least not that I know of,\" Stern said.",
      "He acknowledged that he and his organization did \"unofficially collaborate\" with the U.S. military about positioning and plans, largely to avoid being targeted inadvertently.",
      "Asked about reports that a private extractions specialist contracted by the Trump administration had met Machado in the small Caribbean island nation of Cura\u00e7ao, Stern told CBS News: \"I'm the contractor who specializes in extractions, and I've never been hired by Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"I did not meet her in Cura\u00e7ao. I met her somewhere else. I met her really far away from Curacao. Extremely far,\" he said.",
      "The moment when Machado climbed onto his boat was among the \"moments of transition\" that present the most risk for any rescue operation, he said.",
      "Stern wouldn't say where exactly that happened, beyond it being on a boat in the Caribbean, but he did say the nighttime rendezvous, and the conversation he had with the Venezuelan \"freedom fighter\" in the ensuing hours, made an impression on him.",
      "\"Personally, I was starstruck. She's a hero of mine,\" said Stern. \"When I got to see her for the first time and validate that it was her, my heart skipped a beat.\"",
      "The rough seas and dark skies on Tuesday night were perfect for operating covertly, he said, but they didn't make for an enjoyable ride.",
      "\"The maritime domain is the most unforgiving domain. This was in the middle of the night - very little moon, a little bit of cloud cover, very hard to see, boats have no lights.\"",
      "By the time she climbed aboard, \"all of us were pretty wet. My team and I were soaked to the gills. She was pretty cold and wet, too. She had a very arduous journey.\"",
      "\"She was very happy. She was very excited. She was very tired,\" he said.",
      "Asked about the fact that Machado eventually arrived in Oslo too late to attend Wednesday's Nobel Prize ceremony in person, Stern said \"nothing went wrong, it just took time.\"",
      "\"From my perspective at least, her life was the most important aspect of this. A ceremony is great, but I don't look at this operation as getting Maria to a ceremony on time,\" he said. \"I look at this operation as saving a freedom fighter's life, as saving a mother's life.\"",
      "\"We talked about her seeing her children for the first time in two years and I almost cried,\" Stern told CBS News. \"She's a tough-as-nails, hard-as-woodpecker-lips woman, person, but she's still a mom, and she talked about how excited she was to see her children. It's been two long years.\"",
      "He said being able to facilitate that reunion \"truly was a blessing. We could not feel more privileged or honored to support this operation. She truly is a hero of mine. I've looked at her as an inspirational defender of freedom as long as I've known of her. So to be asked to support this, to conduct this operation, truly was a huge honor, a privilege for us.\"",
      "Machado and her daughter, who accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her mother's behalf Wednesday, said the opposition leader intended to return to Venezuela. Stern said he advised her point blank against it.",
      "\"I think she's crazy. She's such a tough \u2014 you know, they call her the iron lady for a reason. I told her, 'Don't go back.'\"",
      "Asked if Grey Bull would help her get back into the country, Stern told CBS News, \"we've never done an infil, we've only done exfil. So, I don't think so \u2026 That's for her to determine and for her to decide. But I think she should not go back. But she wants to. Maria is truly inspirational.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 09:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Health officials say an infant botulism outbreak tied to ByHeart baby formula has been expanded to include all illnesses reported since the company began production in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "Federal health officials on Wednesday said an outbreak of infant botulism tied to\u00a0recalled ByHeart baby formula\u00a0has expanded to include all illnesses reported since the company began production in March 2022.",
      "Investigations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and ByHeart are still ongoing to determine what originally caused the outbreak, but health officials warned that all ByHeart formula ever produced could have been contaminated.",
      "In an update shared Wednesday, the FDA said it \"cannot rule out the possibility that contamination might have affected all ByHeart formula products.\" Because of that, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is also investigating the outbreak, has expanded the scope of their probe to include any infant infected with botulism who was exposed to ByHeart formula since it came on the market more than three years ago.",
      "The outbreak's official tally now includes at least 51 infants in 19 states, the FDA said, adding that those infants have had either suspected or confirmed botulism in addition to confirmed exposure to ByHeart formula. The most recent illness was reported on Dec. 1.",
      "No deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which was first announced Nov. 8.",
      "To date, cases have been reported in Arizona, California, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, according to the FDA. California has the highest number of cases so far, with at lease nine, and Texas has the second highest, with at least seven or eight, the agency said.",
      "Previously, health officials had said the outbreak included 39 suspected or confirmed cases of infant botulism reported in 18 states since August. That's when officials at California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program reported a rise in treatment of infants who had consumed ByHeart formula. Another 12 cases were identified with the expanded definition, including two that occurred in the original timeline and 10 that occurred from December 2023 through July 2025.",
      "\"They need to be held accountable\"",
      "ByHeart, a New York-based manufacturer of organic infant formula founded in 2016, recalled all its products sold in the U.S. on Nov. 11. The company, which accounts for about 1% of the U.S. infant formula market, had been selling about 200,000 cans of the product each month.",
      "News that ByHeart products could have been contaminated for years was distressing to Andi Galindo, whose 5-week-old daughter, Rowan, was hospitalized in December 2023 with infant botulism after drinking the formula. Galindo, 36, of Redondo Beach, California, said she insisted on using ByHeart formula to supplement a low supply of breast milk because it was recommended by a lactation consultant as \"very natural, very gentle, very good for the babies.\"",
      "\"That's a hard one,\" Galindo said. \"If there is proof that there were issues with their manufacturing and their plant all the way back from the beginning, that is a problem and they really need to be held accountable.\"",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking ByHeart. Being included in the investigation of the outbreak \"feels like a win for all of us,\" she said Wednesday.",
      "\"I've known in my gut from the beginning that ByHeart was the reason Hank got sick, and to see that these cases are now part of the investigation brings me to tears \u2014 a mix of relief, gratitude and hope that the truth is finally being recognized,\" she said.",
      "In a statement late Wednesday, ByHeart officials said the company is cooperating with federal officials \"to understand the full scope of related cases.\"",
      "\"The new cases reported by CDC and FDA will help inform ByHeart's investigation as we continue to seek the root cause of the contamination,\" the statement said.",
      "The FDA sent inspectors last month to ByHeart plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon, where the formula is produced and packaged. The agency has released no results from those inspections.",
      "The company previously reported that tests by an independent laboratory showed that 36 samples from three different lots contained the type of bacteria that can cause infant botulism.",
      "\"We cannot rule out the risk that all ByHeart formula across all product lots may have been contaminated,\" the company wrote on its website last month.",
      "Those results and discussions with the FDA led CDC officials to expand the outbreak, according to Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the investigation.",
      "\"It looks like the contamination appeared to persist across all production runs, different lots, different raw material lots,\" Cope said. \"They couldn't isolate it to specific lots from a certain time period.\"",
      "A contaminated record",
      "Inspection documents showed that ByHeart had a history of problems with contamination.",
      "In 2022, the year ByHeart started making formula, the company recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at a packaging plant tested positive for a different germ, cronobacter sakazakii. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing \"areas that still require corrective actions.\"",
      "A ByHeart plant in Reading, Pennsylvania, was shut down in 2023 just before FDA inspectors found problems with mold, water leaks and insects, documents show.",
      "Infant botulism is a rare disease that affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It's caused when infants ingest botulism bacteria that produce spores that germinate in the intestines, creating a toxin that affects the nervous system. Babies are vulnerable until about age 1 because their gut microbiomes are not mature enough to fight the toxin.",
      "Baby formula has previously been linked to sporadic cases of illness, but no known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, according to research studies.",
      "Symptoms can take up to 30 days to develop and can include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel \"floppy\" and can have problems swallowing or breathing.",
      "The sole treatment for infant botulism is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California's infant botulism program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.",
      "The antibodies provided by BabyBIG are likely most effective for about a month, although they may continue circulating in the child's system for several months, said Dr. Sharon Nachman, an expert in pediatric infectious disease at Stony Brook Children's Hospital.",
      "\"The risk to the infant is ongoing and the family should not be using this formula after it was recalled,\" Nachman said in an email.",
      "Families of several babies treated for botulism after drinking ByHeart formula have sued the company. Lawsuits filed in federal courts allege that the formula they fed their children was defective and ByHeart was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm.",

      "Getting trapped in quicksand is a corny peril of old movies and TV shows, but it really did happen to one unfortunate hiker in Utah's Arches National Park.",
      "The park famous for dozens of natural, sandstone arches gets over 1 million visitors a year, and accidents ranging from falls to heat stroke are common.",
      "Quicksand? Not really - but it has happened at least a couple of times now.",
      "\"The wet sand just kind of flows back in. It's kind of a never-ending battle,\" said John Marshall, who helped a woman stuck in quicksand over a decade ago and coordinated the latest rescue.",
      "On Sunday, an experienced hiker was traversing a small canyon on the second day of a 20-mile backpacking trip when he sank up to his thigh, according to Marshall.",
      "Unable to free himself, the hiker activated an emergency satellite beacon. His message got forwarded to Grand County emergency responders and Marshall got the call at 7:15 a.m..",
      "\"I was just rolling out of bed,\" Marshall said. \"I'm scratching my head, going, 'Did I hear that right? Did they say quicksand?'\"",
      "The hiker wasn't publicly named but Fox13 spoke to him and identified him as Austin Dirks.",
      "\"Before this trip, I honestly thought quicksand was more of a folklore or a legend,\" Dirks told the outlet.",
      "He put his boots on and rendezvoused with a team that set out with all-terrain vehicles, a ladder, traction boards, backboards and a drone. Soon, Marshall had a bird's-eye view of the situation.",
      "Through the drone camera he saw a park ranger who'd tossed the man a shovel. But the quicksand flowed back as soon as the backpacker shoveled it away, Marshall said.",
      "The Grand County Search and Rescue team positioned the ladder and boards near the backpacker and slowly worked his leg loose. By then he'd been standing in near-freezing muck, in temperatures in the 20s, for a couple of hours.",
      "Rescuers warmed him up until he could stand, then walk. He then hiked out on his own, even carrying his backpack, Marshall said.",
      "\"How it's depicted on TV is nothing like it is in real life,\" the hiker, Dirks, told Fox13. \"The human body is more buoyant than the quicksand, so you'll never sink to above your head.\"",
      "Quicksand is dangerous but it's a myth total submersion is the main risk, said Marshall.",
      "\"In quicksand you're extremely buoyant,\" he said. \"Most people won't sink past their waist in quicksand.\"",
      "Marshall is more or less a quicksand expert.",
      "In 2014, he was a medic who helped a 78-year-old woman after she was stuck for over 13 hours in the same canyon just 2 mile from where Sunday's rescue took place.",
      "The woman's book club got worried when she missed their meeting. They went looking for her and found her car at a trailhead. It was June - warmer than Sunday but not sweltering in the canyon's shade - and the woman made a full recovery after regaining use of her legs.",
      "\"Both had very happy endings,\" Marshall said.",
      "The Grand County Search and Rescue team has had a busy year. According to a Facebook post earlier this month, the team has responded to 140 calls so far in 2025, accounting for about 2,900 rescue hours. Among the calls: A stranded canyoneer who got her hair tangled in a rappel device and a couple trapped in their Jeep, caught on a flooded road.",

      "Bard is a parent of a Kentucky State student, Frankfort Assistant Chief of Police Scott Tracy said\u00a0Wednesday at a news conference. He was charged with murder and assault in the first degree, Tracy said.",
      "Tracy said it was too early to say what led up to the shooting that occurred outside the Young Hall student dormitory on the south side of the school's campus.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Tracy described the shooting as an isolated incident, but investigators have not shared details about the circumstances.",
      "\"This was not a mass shooting or a random incident,\" the governor said in a video statement Tuesday.",

      "Bears have killed a record 13 people in Japan this year and injured more than 200 others, while reports of the creatures roaming near schools and rampaging in supermarkets have heightened anxiety, especially in rural northern regions.",
      "The hiker's GPS watch, which uses satellite signals to log routes and monitors heart rate, was retrieved after the fatal attack on August 14, the Asahi Shimbun reported.",
      "Data from the device showed that at around 11 a.m. it suddenly deviated from the hiking trail in Hokkaido and went down a forested slope, the daily said.",
      "In an area of thick brush, it repeatedly circled and passed over the same spot.",
      "The watch also showed that the man's heart stopped beating about 100 to 130 yards from the trail, indicating that he died there.",
      "The watch remained in the same spot all night but moved again around 9 a.m. the next morning, travelling several hundred yards through the brush.",
      "This suggests the brown bear had come back and dragged the man's body away, the Asahi said.",
      "Three days later, on August 15, a bear with two cubs was spotted dragging his body in its mouth. All three animals were killed.",
      "A mound of earth made by the bear was found nearby and traces of the man -- who was engaged to be married -- were discovered, the report added.",

      "Thousands of the animals are shot every year.",

      "The government estimated that an offshore megaquake could cause a tsunami of up to 98 feet and kill nearly 200,000 people. Officials said the advisory was not a prediction, and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake was only about 1%.",
      "There was hope the advisory would serve as a wake-up call for a quake that could have the devastation of the\u00a02011 disaster\u00a0that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed a nuclear plant.",
      "Monday's quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches \u2014 the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench \u2014 that have caused many large quakes in the past.",

      "The U.S. seized a 20-year-old oil tanker called The Skipper off the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday, three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News, after months of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The seizure was initially announced by President Trump during an unrelated White House event on Wednesday. Here's what we know about the boat and the operation:",
      "Seizure involved special operations forces and 2 helicopters",
      "The operation to seize the tanker began Wednesday morning, after the boat had just left port in Venezuela, according to a senior military official and a source familiar with the operation.",
      "The mission was launched from the USS Gerald R. Ford, an aircraft carrier that has been in the area for weeks as part of a broader buildup of U.S. forces in the region, the sources told CBS News.",
      "It involved two helicopters, special operations forces, 10 members of the U.S. Coast Guard and 10 Marines, the sources said. The boarding team was composed of the Coast Guard's Maritime Security and Response Team, an elite maritime interdiction unit based in Chesapeake, Virginia.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a 45-second video of the operation on X, showing armed personnel descending onto the vessel's deck from a helicopter. She said the U.S. executed a seizure warrant on the vessel, and that the tanker was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.\"",
      "While the U.S. government \u2014 particularly the Justice Department and Homeland Security Investigations \u2014 has seized sanctioned oil tankers before, conducting a fast-rope boarding from helicopters at sea is rare, though it's something the boarding team trains for, U.S. officials said.",
      "The operation was led by the Coast Guard, supported by Navy forces, the officials told CBS News. Any such operation would legally require the Coast Guard to be the lead agency because the authorities used for these seizures fall under Coast Guard jurisdiction.",
      "What's happening to the vessel and its oil after the seizure",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday that the vessel is \"currently undergoing a forfeiture process right now.\"",
      "\"The United States currently has a full investigative team on the ground, on the vessel, and individuals on board the vessel are being interviewed and any relevant evidence is being seized,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt said the vessel will go to a U.S. port.",
      "\"The United States does intend to seize the oil,\" she continued. \"However, there is a legal process for the seizure of that oil, and that legal process will be followed.\"",
      "Tanker was sanctioned by Treasury 3 years ago",
      "The Skipper was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group backed by Iran.",
      "The ship \u2014 known as Adisa in 2022 \u2014 is among the vessels controlled by sanctioned Russian oil magnate Viktor Artemov, the Treasury said in a statement. At the time, the Treasury said Artemov transported Iranian oil using an expansive network of ships that were often registered in obscure ways with the intention of skirting U.S. restrictions on Iranian petroleum exports.",
      "The Treasury's 2022 sanctions announcement didn't mention Venezuela. But oil networks involving both Iran and Venezuela have been reported for years, drawing pushback from the United States. The two countries are major petroleum producers with some of the world's largest oil reserves, but trade is restricted by heavy U.S. sanctions.",
      "The tanker is controlled by Nigeria-based management company Thomarose Global Ventures LTD and owned by a firm linked to Artemov, according to publicly available data.",
      "The ship is 20 years old, initially sailing under the name The Toyo in 2005. At 333 meters (about 1,092 feet) in length, it was one of the largest tankers in the world at the time it was built.",
      "The government of Guyana \u2014 which borders Venezuela \u2014 said in a statement Wednesday the ship was falsely flying the Guyanese flag, despite not being registered in the South American country",
      "Bondi said the boat was sanctioned \"due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.\"",
      "\"This seizure, completed off the coast of Venezuela, was conducted safely and securely \u2014 and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues,\" the attorney general said.",
      "Venezuela's government said in a statement that it \"strongly denounces and repudiates what constitutes a shameless robbery and an act of international piracy.\"",

      "The sanctions are meant to deny them access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S., and the penalties are intended to prevent U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with them.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-super-embassy-heart-of-london-critics-fear-hub-intel-gathering/",
    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 14:53:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Two former MI6 officials detail their espionage concerns, as the U.K once again delays its final decision on a new Chinese embassy in London.",
    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom once again delayed its decision last week on whether to green light China's push for a new, massive embassy in the heart of London. It would not only be the largest Chinese embassy in Europe, but also one of the largest in the world.",
      "Beijing's hope, however, still hangs in frustrated limbo after three decision delays, six major anti-embassy protests and Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week calling China \"a country that poses real national security threats to the United Kingdom.\" His defense minister further cited \"complexities of the national security implications.\"",
      "Critics fear the so-called \"super embassy\" could serve as a super hub for intelligence gathering \u2013 physically and technologically, impacting not just the United Kingdom, but also the continent.",
      "\"There are important fiber optic cables that either run under the site or very close to the site, which carry probably massive amounts of important and valuable data,\" said Sir Richard Dearlove, former chief of Britain's MI6, the U.K.'s foreign intelligence agency.",
      "Dearlove has called on the U.K. government to reject China's embassy ambitions, with cables possibly transmitting sensitive financial and commercial data across London.",
      "\"Having a Chinese embassy sitting on top of those cables, which could in extremis be attacked, is a significant problem,\" he added.",
      "With a larger physical presence, Beijing could also employ more Chinese diplomatic staff, who would have freedom of movement allowed by their visas.",
      "\"If it's got a very large embassy, there could be a very large number, and then going off to third countries, ostensibly on holiday or whatever, or to travel, and doing stuff outside the country to which they're accredited,\" said Dearlove.",
      "\"They're purporting to be ordinary diplomats, ordinary attaches, who are actually highly trained intelligence personnel,\" he said.",
      "Beijing might also more easily target communications from the defense and foreign ministries using facilities based within a bigger embassy, said Nigel Inkster, former MI6 director of operations and intelligence and now senior adviser for cyber security and China at the Institute for International and Strategic Studies.",
      "\"Not all systems, not all government systems use the internet,\" Inkster said. \"Most sensitive information is air-gapped. In other words, it goes on systems that do not have any connection to the public internet, and therefore, if you're going to try and access them, you are going to have to get closer to where they are actually being generated.\"",
      "\"Would China like to get ahold of such data?\" he added. \"Yes, because China's appetite to acquire data on other countries is limitless. They're completely promiscuous about what overseas data they collect.\"",
      "Site of proposed embassy is in heart of London",
      "British pushback also stems from history and pride. The site of China's would-be embassy overlooks the iconic Tower of London and The Shard. It is the former home of the Royal Mint, which engraved coins with the monarch's face as a physical manifestation of the crown's authority.",
      "In 2018, the government sold the grounds to Beijing for nearly $350 million, setting up the more than five-acre site to become a physical fortress of Chinese state power in the West.",
      "\"One of the reasons I object \u2014 maybe the main reason \u2014 is the symbolism of allowing the Chinese communist government such a prominent position on the edge of the city in such a prominent building,\" said Dearlove. \"It sends entirely the wrong signals.\"",
      "Taking up an entire city block and spanning five acres, architectural renderings indicate China's new embassy would dwarf its embassy in Washington, D.C. by about three times and its current embassy in London by about 10 times. It took our CBS News team more than nine minutes to walk the perimeter.",
      "Schematics show plans for a cultural center and more than 200 apartments for embassy staff \u2013 not a common feature of Western governments' embassies but employed by some authoritarian governments including Russia, North Korea and Cuba to keep employees close at hand.",
      "CBS News got a first-hand look at the future embassy residences \u2013 buildings that sit on the site that is owned by the Chinese government. They are currently empty.",
      "Mark Nygate, a 28-year resident just next door in the London borough of Tower Hamlets, gave CBS News a tour of his building and the inner parking lot that abuts the Royal Mint grounds. A simple, low wooden fence separates the two.",
      "\"I call it the little wooden fence of China,\" he said jokingly.",
      "He and his neighbors fear that the Chinese government will eventually push them out.",
      "\"The idea is that at some point they will want to make this a harder border for them, make their staff more secure,\" he said. \"They could try and buy us out.\"",
      "Fear from China's exiles and dissidents",
      "Thousands of anti-embassy protestors, Chinese dissidents and exiles marched through central London this past weekend, newly galvanized after Starmer's most recent decision delay. Many held large flags showing support for Hong Kong, Taiwan and Tibet.",
      "\"I was under the impression that the U.K. government was ready to sell us out,\" said Tenzin Ragba, the campaign lead for Free Tibet, a nonprofit that calls for an end to what the group describes as China's occupation of Tibet and dilution of Tibetan culture since the 1950s.",
      "\"China is a systemic rival for democracy,\" said Carmen Lau, a former Hong Kong pro-democracy politician now living in exile in the U.K. \"You wouldn't just simply open the door for an autocracy or an authoritarian regime to have a base in the heart of your capital.\"",
      "Since she fled Hong Kong after the failed pro-democracy protests of 2019, Beijing has been watching Lau in London, she says, looking to detain anti-China voices abroad.",
      "\"I've been followed, on the streets of London,\" she said. \"They don't deploy Chinese or Asian faces people to follow us - rather they would just deploy someone random in the community.\"",
      "Lau said her neighbors also received a \"wanted\" letter, calling on them to turn her in to the Chinese embassy, for a reward equivalent to about $125,000.",
      "\"I was so afraid to talk to them after these incidents happened. Because, you know, who knows who really will be tempted by the rewards,\" she said.",
      "Several other former Hong Kong pro-democracy leaders have similar bounties on their heads. The U.K. has become home to the world's largest Hong Kong diaspora community with an estimated nearly 200,000 having fled in the past five years.",
      "London wants a new embassy, too",
      "The U.K. government delayed its final decision on China's embassy proposal to Jan. 20.",
      "Prime Minister Starmer has proposed a trip to Beijing just nine days later. That would mark the first time a British premier visits China since 2018, before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The government is hoping China will approve its own plan for a new embassy in Beijing.",
      "Starmer's visit may depend on whether Beijing gets what it wants first in London.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 10:36:00 -0500",
    "summary": "An American special forces veteran led the operation to get Mar\u00eda Corina Machado out of Venezuela: \"The first Nobel Prize winner that we've ever rescued.\"",
    "story": [
      "It took an American private rescue team 15 to 16 hours to get Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado out of her country and safely on her way to Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize, and to be reunited with her family on Wednesday. The vast majority of that time was spent in rough seas, and the man who led the operation and met Machado on a boat told CBS News, \"no one was enjoying that ride, especially Maria!\"",
      "\"No one's blood pressure was low, throughout any phase of this operation, including mine,\" said Bryan Stern, a U.S. special forces veteran who heads the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation. \"It was dangerous. It was scary. The sea conditions were ideal for us, but certainly not water that you would want to be on ... the higher the waves, the harder it is for radar to see. That's how it works.\"",
      "In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, Stern gave some insight into the complex operation his organization undertook to get Machado out of Venezuela and on a plane to Norway, where she was reunited with her children for the first time in about two years. A representative for Machado confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that Grey Bull was behind the rescue operation that began on Tuesday.",
      "Of the hundreds of rescues his organization has carried out, he said this was both one of the most challenging and the most rewarding. Machado has lived in hiding in her own country for almost a year, fearing persecution by the regime of President Nicolas Maduro, who is under increasing pressure from President Trump amid a U.S. military buildup off his shores.",
      "\"She has a very large target on her back,\" Stern said of Machado. \"This is not a random shopkeeper who doesn't wanna be in Venezuela anymore. This is moving around a rock star.\"",
      "\"She's the first Nobel Prize winner that we've ever rescued, you know? She's the first person that we've ever rescued that has billboards with her face all over it in a country, where there's protests in her favor. We've never rescued anybody with her status, with her stature,\" he said.",
      "Her high profile, combined with the Maduro regime taking \"a very defensive posture because of the American military buildup,\" meant huge risks for the operation, and Stern was reluctant to divulge much detail about the operation on land, \"because we still have other work to do in Venezuela, and we don't want to put sources and methods and people who worked on this at risk.\"",
      "But once Machado had been spirited off Venezuelan soil onto a boat, she was ferried to a rendezvous at sea, and Stern was there himself to welcome her onto his boat for a 13-14 hour journey to an undisclosed location where she caught her flight to Oslo.",
      "He said around two dozen people were involved directly within his team, but many more played a role - from providing intelligence to translation and logistics - including some who may never even know that they helped.",
      "Stern and Grey Bull were in charge of the land and maritime portion of the extraction, which he said had to be planned in only about four days, though his organization has been preparing for operations in Venezuela for months.",
      "He said the operation was funded by \"a few generous donors,\" none of whom \u2013 to his knowledge \u2013 were U.S. government officials.",
      "\"The U.S. government did not contribute a single penny to this operation, at least not that I know of,\" Stern said.",
      "He acknowledged that he and his organization did \"unofficially collaborate\" with the U.S. military about positioning and plans, largely to avoid being targeted inadvertently.",
      "Asked about reports that a private extractions specialist contracted by the Trump administration had met Machado in the small Caribbean island nation of Cura\u00e7ao, Stern told CBS News: \"I'm the contractor who specializes in extractions, and I've never been hired by Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"I did not meet her in Cura\u00e7ao. I met her somewhere else. I met her really far away from Curacao. Extremely far,\" he said.",
      "The moment when Machado climbed onto his boat was among the \"moments of transition\" that present the most risk for any rescue operation, he said.",
      "Stern wouldn't say where exactly that happened, beyond it being on a boat in the Caribbean, but he did say the nighttime rendezvous, and the conversation he had with the Venezuelan \"freedom fighter\" in the ensuing hours, made an impression on him.",
      "\"Personally, I was starstruck. She's a hero of mine,\" said Stern. \"When I got to see her for the first time and validate that it was her, my heart skipped a beat.\"",
      "The rough seas and dark skies on Tuesday night were perfect for operating covertly, he said, but they didn't make for an enjoyable ride.",
      "\"The maritime domain is the most unforgiving domain. This was in the middle of the night - very little moon, a little bit of cloud cover, very hard to see, boats have no lights.\"",
      "By the time she climbed aboard, \"all of us were pretty wet. My team and I were soaked to the gills. She was pretty cold and wet, too. She had a very arduous journey.\"",
      "\"She was very happy. She was very excited. She was very tired,\" he said.",
      "Asked about the fact that Machado eventually arrived in Oslo too late to attend Wednesday's Nobel Prize ceremony in person, Stern said \"nothing went wrong, it just took time.\"",
      "\"From my perspective at least, her life was the most important aspect of this. A ceremony is great, but I don't look at this operation as getting Maria to a ceremony on time,\" he said. \"I look at this operation as saving a freedom fighter's life, as saving a mother's life.\"",
      "\"We talked about her seeing her children for the first time in two years and I almost cried,\" Stern told CBS News. \"She's a tough-as-nails, hard-as-woodpecker-lips woman, person, but she's still a mom, and she talked about how excited she was to see her children. It's been two long years.\"",
      "He said being able to facilitate that reunion \"truly was a blessing. We could not feel more privileged or honored to support this operation. She truly is a hero of mine. I've looked at her as an inspirational defender of freedom as long as I've known of her. So to be asked to support this, to conduct this operation, truly was a huge honor, a privilege for us.\"",
      "Machado and her daughter, who accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her mother's behalf Wednesday, said the opposition leader intended to return to Venezuela. Stern said he advised her point blank against it.",
      "\"I think she's crazy. She's such a tough \u2014 you know, they call her the iron lady for a reason. I told her, 'Don't go back.'\"",
      "Asked if Grey Bull would help her get back into the country, Stern told CBS News, \"we've never done an infil, we've only done exfil. So, I don't think so \u2026 That's for her to determine and for her to decide. But I think she should not go back. But she wants to. Maria is truly inspirational.\"",

      "With the world's first social media ban for teenagers under 16 now in effect in Australia, its initial political architect is celebrating a new less-digital era for millions of children \u2014 and sharing that the legislation was personally inspired by his wife, for their four children.",
      "\"She read a book called 'The Anxious Generation,' by Jonathan Haidt,\" said Peter Malinauskas, the premier of the state of South Australia. \"And I will never forget the night she finished reading the book and she put it down on her lap and she turned to me and said, 'You better do something about this!'\"",
      "Within seven months, and with strong public support, that idea fast became law across the land, winning support from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Ten major apps including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit and Facebook have complied to bar everyone 16 and under from their accounts and from setting up new accounts.",
      "\"Heaven forbid they might talk to one another a bit more, pick up the phone and have a chat rather than just being obsessed with the screen,\" said Maulinauskas.",
      "The ban puts the onus of responsibility on social media companies rather than parents with a penalty of up to $33 million if found to be in breach. It allows for each company to decide how best to adhere, which must be \"multi-layered,\" using more than one kind of identity verification, which could include traditional methods including national IDs and passports but also artificial intelligence \u2014 controversial over possible inaccuracies \u2014 to scan facial features for age.",
      "Malinauskas readily admits there will be growing pains.",
      "\"People will find ways around it and lots of things will go wrong, and that'll be highlighted in coming days and weeks in Australia,\" he said, \"but on balance, this is a reform that parents want so they can do their job more easily.\"",
      "He says officials from North America, Europe and Asia have been speaking with him about advancing similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is already on track to be the next country to ban those under 16 from social media in 2026.",
      "Yet in Australia, the law already faces a legal challenge. The country's High Court accepted a legal challenge from two 15-year-olds who assert the ban violates their freedom of communication. The case could be heard as early as February.",
      "Malinauskas blames those companies for putting all children through \"a global experiment\" over the past decade with \"social media addiction and overuse because many of these platforms have had addictive algorithms.\"",
      "\"I'm really proud, really proud that we've been able to see South Australia and then Australia lead a reform that's going to make a big difference to young people's lives,\" he said.",

    "title": "How one couple sparked a global movement for a smartphone-free childhood",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/smartphone-free-childhood-australia-social-media-ban/",
    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 11:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "For thousands of parents in 39 countries, including the U.S., the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
    "story": [
      "Suffolk, England - For parents Daisy Greenwell and Joe Ryrie, freedom means looking up at the world around them instead of down at their phones, and they're determined to pass that sense of non-digital liberty on to their children.",
      "Their daughter started asking for a smartphone when she was just eight years old, because her classmates were getting them. The pressure to have a phone at such a young age surprised Greenwell, and pushed her to look more closely at the trend.",
      "She found a growing body of research suggesting that heavy smartphone use may negatively impact young people's mental health.",
      "The more she read, the more concerned she became, so Greenwell decided to take action. She posted a question on Instagram: What if we could switch the norm? What if parents united to create a \"smartphone-free childhood?\"",
      "The response was immediate.",
      "\"That post went viral,\" she told CBS News. \"Thousands of parents joined the group overnight.\"",
      "Within a couple weeks, Greenwell said there were smartphone-free childhood groups in every county in England. One year later, the grassroots campaign has expanded far beyond the U.K. borders.",
      "The group \u2014 Smartphone Free Childhood \u2014 now has chapters in 39 countries.",
      "For Greenwell, Ryrie and the thousands of families who've joined the movement, the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
      "In the U.S., the movement even inspired a cautionary viral advertisement, highlighting the dangers of giving children unrestricted access to the internet. A parent in the ad tells their child: \"There's a box in the corner with all the pornographic material ever made. I'm trusting you not to look in there, okay?\"",
      "The backlash against youth consumption of social media has drawn the attention of governments globally. On Wednesday, Australia became the first country in the world to enact a ban on social media accounts for children under the age of 16. The law compels huge tech companies such as Meta and TikTok to enforce age restrictions, or face hefty fines.",
      "In the U.K., national Culture Minister Lisa Nandy said the government would be keeping a \"close eye\" on Australia's social media ban, but added that there were no current plans to replicate the legislation.",
      "At a grassroots level, however, parents who join Greenwell and Ryrie's movement are asked to sign a pact: No smartphones for the kids before they turn 14, and no social media before 16.",
      "\"This isn't an anti-tech movement, it's a pro-childhood movement. We're not saying no smartphones ever. We're just saying children don't need unrestricted internet access in their pockets 24/7,\" Ryrie told CBS News.",
      "When asked what she'd tell busy working parents who rely on phones for convenience, Greenwell acknowledged the challenge.",
      "\"It's really tough,\" she said. \"But delaying the smartphone is free, it's simple, and it gives your child the best chance to thrive.\"",
      "Many families are turning to basic \"brick phones\" as alternatives \u2014 devices that allow calls and texts, but limit internet access. Sales of such \"dumb\" devices have risen 150% among 18-24 year olds in the United States, according to a study by the peer-reviewed journal Partners Universal Innovative Research Publication.",
      "Despite the momentum, Greenwell says there's still a cultural norm to disrupt, and available data highlights that point. One in four British kids between the ages of 5 and 7 already own a smartphone, according to the U.K.'s independent media regulator Ofcom.",
      "Greenwell said she believes real change can be driven from the community level.",
      "\"If children know several classmates are also delaying smartphones, the peer pressure dissolves,\" she told CBS News. \"It becomes easier for families to wait a few years. A brick phone in the meantime isn't that hard. We can do this.\"",

    "story": [
      "The daughter of Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado gave a speech in Oslo on Wednesday on behalf of her mother, who was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Ana Corina Sosa Machado accepted the prize for her mother at the award ceremony in Norway's capital. Mar\u00eda Corina Machado has been in hiding for months and did not attend the ceremony, but said she was heading to Norway's capital where she would embrace her family and her children who she has not seen in two years. She will later return to Venezuela, according to her daughter.",
      "Maria Corina Machado was awarded the prize \"for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,\" and Norwegian Nobel Committee Chair J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes called Machado \"a brave and committed champion of peace.\"",
      "Here are the remarks given by Ana Corina Sosa Machado in Oslo on Wednesday, including the speech she delivered for her mother:",
      "Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, citizens of the world, my dear Venezuelans:",
      "First, I want to express our infinite gratitude from my family, from an entire country, to the Norwegian Nobel committee. Thanks to you, the struggle of an entire people for truth, for freedom, for democracy and peace is today recognized around the world.",
      "I am here on behalf of my mother, Maria Corina Machado, who has united millions of Venezuelans in an extraordinary effort that you, our hosts, have honored with a Nobel Peace Prize. But although she has not been able to be here and take part in this ceremony, I must say that my mother never breaks a promise. And that is why, with all the joy in my heart, I can tell you that in just a few hours, we will be able to embrace her here, in Oslo, after 16 months living in hiding. And as I await that moment to hug her, to kiss her, to embrace her after two years, I think of the other daughters and sons who do not get to see their mothers today. This is what drives her, what drives all of us. She wants to live in a free Venezuela and she will never give up on that purpose. That is why we all know, and I know, that she will be back in Venezuela very soon.",
      "In the meantime, at this moment, I face the difficult task of giving voice to her words, the speech she prepared for this occasion.",
      "This is her speech:",
      "I have come here to tell you a story: the story of a people and their long march toward freedom.",
      "This march brings me here today as one voice among millions of Venezuelans who rose, once again, to reclaim the destiny that was always theirs.",
      "Venezuela was born of audacity, shaped by peoples and cultures intertwined. From Spain we inherited a language, a culture, and a faith that merged with ancestral Indigenous and African roots.",
      "In 1811, we wrote the first constitution in the Spanish-speaking world, one of the earliest republican constitutions on Earth, affirming the radical idea that every human being carries a sovereign dignity. This constitution enshrined citizenship, individual rights, religious liberty, and separation of powers.",
      "Our ancestors carried liberty on their backs. They crossed an entire continent, from the banks of the Orinoco to the heights of the Potos\u00ed, to help give rise to societies of free and equal citizens, out of the conviction that freedom is never whole unless it is shared.",
      "From the beginning, we believed something simple and immense: that all human beings are born to be free. That conviction became our national soul.",
      "In the twentieth century, the earth opened: in 1922, the Revent\u00f3n in La Rosa erupted for nine days: a fountain of oil and possibility.",
      "In peace, we turned that sudden wealth into an engine for knowledge and imagination.",
      "Through the ingenuity of our scientists, we eradicated disease. We built universities of global prestige, museums and concert halls, sent thousands of young Venezuelans abroad through scholarships, trusting that free minds would return as transformation. Our cities glowed with the kinetic art of Cruz-Diez and Soto.",
      "We forged steel, aluminum, and hydropower\u2014proof that Venezuela could build anything it dared to envision.",
      "Venezuela also became a refuge.",
      "We opened our arms to migrants and exiles from every corner of the earth: Spaniards fleeing civil war; Italians and Portuguese escaping poverty and dictatorship; Jews after the Holocaust; Chileans, Argentinians, and Uruguayans escaping military regimes; Cubans escaping communism and families from Colombia, Lebanon and Syria seeking peace.",
      "We gave them homes, schools, safety. And they became Venezuelans.",
      "This is Venezuela.",
      "We built a democracy that became the most stable in Latin America, and freedom unfolded as a creative force.",
      "But even the strongest democracy weakens when its citizens forget that freedom is not something we wait for, but something we become.",
      "It is a deliberate, personal choice, and the sum of those choices forms the civic ethos that must be renewed every day.",
      "The concentration of oil revenues in the State created perverse incentives: it gave the government immense power over society which turned into privilege, patronage, and corruption.",
      "My generation was born in a vibrant democracy, and we took it for granted. We assumed freedom was as permanent as the air we breathed. We cherished our rights, but we forgot our duties.",
      "I was raised by a father whose life's work \u2014 building, creating, serving \u2014 taught me that loving this country meant assuming responsibility for its future.",
      "By the time we recognized how fragile our institutions had become, a man who had once led a military coup to overthrow the democracy, was elected president. Many thought charisma could substitute the rule of law.",
      "From 1999 onward, the regime dismantled our democracy: violating the Constitution, falsifying our history, corrupting the military, purging independent judges, censoring the press, manipulating elections, persecuting dissent, and ravaging our extraordinary biodiversity.",
      "Oil wealth was not used to uplift, but to bind.",
      "Washing machines and refrigerators were handed out on national television to families living on dirt floors, not as progress but as spectacle.",
      "Apartments meant for social housing were handed to a select few with a condition for unquestionable obedience.",
      "And then came the ruin:",
      "Obscene corruption; historic looting. During the regime's rule, Venezuela received more oil revenue than in the previous century combined. And it was all stolen.",
      "Oil money became a tool to purchase loyalty abroad while at home criminal and international terrorist groups fused themselves to the state.",
      "The economy collapsed by more than 80%.",
      "Poverty surpassed 86%.",
      "Today, nine million Venezuelans have been forced to flee.",
      "These are not statistics; they are open wounds.",
      "Meanwhile, something deeper and more corrosive took place. It was a deliberate method: to divide society by ideology, by race, by origin, by ways of life; pushing Venezuelans to distrust one another, to silence one another, to see enemies in one another. They smothered us, they took us prisoners, they killed us, and they forced us into exile.",
      "It had been almost three decades of fighting against a brutal dictatorship.",
      "And we had tried everything: dialogues betrayed; protests of millions, crushed; elections perverted.",
      "Hope collapsed entirely, and belief in any kind of future became impossible. The idea of change seemed either na\u00efve or crazy. It seemed impossible.",
      "Yet, from the very depths of that despair, a step that seemed modest, almost procedural, changed the course of our history.",
      "We decided, against all odds, to run a primary election. An unlikely act of rebellion. We chose to trust the people.",
      "To rediscover one another, we traveled by road and by dirt path in a country with gasoline shortages, daily blackouts and collapsing communications.",
      "Forbidden from advertising, without money or media willing to speak our names, we crossed it armed only with conviction.",
      "Word of mouth was our network of hope, and it spread faster than any campaign. Because our desire for freedom was very much alive within us and it had never died.",
      "The forced migration that was meant to fracture us, instead united us around one sacred purpose: to reunite our families in our land. Grandparents confided in me their greatest fear: dying before meeting their grandchildren abroad; little girls, with voices too small for such sorrow, begged me to bring back their mothers and siblings scattered across the continent.",
      "Our pain fused into one heartbeat: bring our children home, now.",
      "In May 2023, during a rally in the small town of Nirgua, a teacher named Carmen came up to me. She told me she had just run into her Jefa de Calle. Jefa de Calle's a regime agent assigned to Carmen's block who decides, house by house, who receives a monthly food bag and who is punished with hunger.",
      "Shocked to see this woman there, Carmen had asked her \"Why are you here?\"",
      "The Jefa de Calle replied: \"My only son, who fled to Peru, asked me to be here today. He told me that if Maria Corina wins, he will return home. Tell me what I have to do. I'll do anything.\"",
      "That day, love defeated fear.",
      "Two weeks later, we reached Delicias, a tiny village swallowed by Colombian guerrillas and drug traffickers, where not even a chicken can be sold without their permission. No candidate had gone there since 1978.",
      "And as the team climbed the mountain, I saw Venezuelan flags waving from every humble home. I na\u00efvely asked if it was a national holiday that merited all the flags, and someone whispered: \"No. Here the flag are hidden. Bringing it out is dangerous. Today people raised them to thank you for daring to come. You will leave\u2026 but we will remain, identified.\"",
      "That day, entire families stood up to the armed groups that ruled their lives. And when we sang the national anthem together, sovereignty returned in a single, fragile, defiant chorus.",
      "That day, courage defeated oppression.",
      "Our gatherings became intimate encounters of thousands.",
      "We embraced, we cried, we prayed.",
      "We understood our struggle was much more than electoral.",
      "It was an ethical struggle for truth. An existential struggle for life. And a spiritual struggle for good.",
      "With less than a year before the presidential election, we had to unite every democratic force and restore trust in the vote. The primaries became that moment: a self-organized civic effort that built a nationwide citizen network unlike anything Venezuela had ever seen.",
      "And on October 22 of 2023, against all odds, Venezuela awoke.",
      "The diaspora, which was a third of our nation, reclaimed its right to vote.",
      "The son who had left cast his ballot alongside the mother who stayed.",
      "Lines stretched for blocks. Turnout was so overwhelming that ballots actually ran out. We trusted the people, and they trusted us back.",
      "What began as a mechanism to legitimize leadership became the rebirth of a nation's confidence in itself. That day, I received a mandate: a responsibility that transcended any individual ambition. I felt humbled and profoundly aware of the weight with which I had been entrusted.",
      "Threatened by that truth though, the regime prohibited me from running for president. It was a harsh blow, but mandates belong to the people.",
      "We set out to find another candidate who could take my place.",
      "Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia stepped forward: a calm, brave former diplomat. The regime believed he posed no threat.",
      "But they underestimated the resolve of millions of citizens \u2014 a plural, vibrant society that, in all its diversity, found unity in a common purpose. Communities, political parties, unions, students, and civil society stood together and worked as one so that the voice of a nation could be heard.",
      "We were three months from Election Day, and almost no one knew his name.",
      "But votes were not enough; we had to defend them. For over a year, we had been building the infrastructure to do so: 600,000 volunteers across 30,000 polling stations; apps to scan QR codes, digital platforms, diaspora call centers. We deployed scanners, Starlink antennas, and laptops hidden inside fruit trucks to the furthest corners of Venezuela. Technology became a tool for freedom.",
      "Secret training sessions were held at dawn in church backrooms, kitchens, and basements, using printed materials moved across Venezuela like contraband.",
      "Finally, Election Day arrived on July 28, 2024. Before dawn, lines wrapped around blocks. A quiet, trembling hope filled the air. Our live tracking showed turnout rising across every state and town. And then the electoral tally sheets\u2014 the famous actas, the sacred proof of the people's will\u2014began to appear: first by phone, then WhatsApp, then photographed, then scanned, and finally carried by hand, by mule, by canoe.",
      "They arrived from everywhere across Venezuela, an eruption of truth, because thousands of citizens risked their freedom to protect them.",
      "Confronted with our overwhelming victory, the regime issued a desperate order: soldiers were to expel our volunteers from voting centers and block them from receiving the original tally sheets they were legally entitled to.",
      "But the soldiers disobeyed.",
      "Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia  won with 67% of the vote, in every state, city and village.",
      "In every state, city and village, every single tally sheet told the same story.",
      "Within hours, they were digitized and published on a website for the world to see.",
      "But the dictatorship responded with terror.",
      "2,500 people kidnapped, disappeared, tortured.",
      "Homes marked.",
      "Entire families taken as hostages.",
      "Priests, teachers, nurses, students, anyone who dared share a tally sheet was hunted down.",
      "These are crimes against humanity, documented by the United Nations. State terrorism, deployed to bury the will of the people.",
      "Some of the more than 220 children detained after the elections were electrocuted, beaten and suffocated until they repeated the lie the regime needed, falsely incriminating themselves of being paid by me to protest. Women and girls in prison are right now being forced into sexual slavery, made to endure abuse in exchange for a family visit, a meal or the chance to take a bath.",
      "And yet, the Venezuelan people did not surrender.",
      "During these past 16 months in clandestinity, we have built new networks of civic pressure and disciplined disobedience, preparing for Venezuela's orderly transition to democracy.",
      "That is how we reach this day, a day carrying the echo of millions who stand at the threshold of freedom.",
      "This prize carries profound meaning; it reminds the world that democracy is essential to peace.",
      "And more than anything, what we Venezuelans can offer the world is the lesson forged through this long and difficult journey: that to have democracy, we must be willing to fight for freedom.",
      "And freedom is a choice that must be renewed each day, measured by our willingness and our courage to defend it.",
      "For this reason, the cause of Venezuela transcends our borders. A people who choose freedom contribute not only to themselves, but to humanity.",
      "We attain freedom only when we refuse to turn our backs on ourselves; when we confront the truth directly, no matter how painful; when love for what truly matters in life gives us the strength to persevere and to prevail.",
      "Only through that inner alignment \u2014 that vital integrity \u2014 do we rise to meet our destiny. Only then do we become who we truly are, able to live a life worthy of being lived.",
      "Along this march to freedom, we gained profound certainties of the soul \u2014 truths that have given our lives a deeper meaning and prepared us to build a great future in peace.",
      "Therefore, peace is ultimately an act of love.",
      "This love has already set our future in motion.",
      "Venezuela will breathe again.",
      "We will open prison doors and watch thousands who were unjustly detained step into the warm sun, embraced at last by those who never stopped fighting for them.",
      "We will see grandmothers settle children on their laps to tell them stories not of distant forefathers, but of their own parents' courage.",
      "We will see our students debate ideas passionately and without fear, their voices rising freely at last.",
      "We will hug again. Fall in love again. Hear our streets fill with laughter and music again.",
      "All the simple joys in the world that we have taken for granted will be ours.",
      "My dear Venezuelans, the world has marveled at what we have achieved. And soon it will witness one of the most moving sights of our time: our loved ones coming home \u2014 and I will stand again on the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge, where I once cried among the thousands who were leaving, and welcome them back into the luminous life that awaits us.",
      "Because in the end, our journey towards freedom has always lived inside us.",
      "We are returning to ourselves. We are returning home.",
      "Allow me to honor the heroes of this journey:",
      "Our political prisoners, the persecuted, their families, and all who defend human rights; those who sheltered us, fed us, and risked everything to protect us; the journalists who refused silence, the artists who carried our voice; my exceptional team, my mentors, my fellow political and social activists; the leaders around the world who joined and defended our cause; my three children, my adored father, my mother, my three sisters, my brave and loving husband, who've all supported me throughout my life; and above all, the millions of anonymous Venezuelans who risked their homes, their families, and their lives out of love.",
      "To them belongs this honor.",
      "To them belongs this day.",
      "To them belongs the future.",

      "Sophie Kinsella, the author of \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" and a series of millions-selling sequels, has died, her family said on social media.",
      "Kinsella, whose real name was Madeleine Wickham, had been diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in late 2022. She announced the diagnosis in April 2024. She said at the time that she delayed the announcement to let her children adjust to their new normal. Kinsella also said that she underwent surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat the disease.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce the passing this morning of our beloved Sophie (aka Maddy, aka Mummy). She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy,\" Kinsella's family wrote on Instagram. \"We can't imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.\"",
      "Kinsella published 10 \"Shopaholic\" novels, beginning with \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" in 2000. The first two \"Shopaholic\" books were adapted into the 2009 film \"Confessions of a Shopaholic,\" starring Isla Fisher.",
      "Her 2024 novella \"What Does It Feel Like?\" was a semi-fictional account of her cancer diagnosis, according to CBS News partner BBC News. In an introduction to the book, Kinsella said she had \"always processed my life through writing.\"",

      "Oslo, Norway\u00a0\u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado\u00a0missed the ceremony to award her the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on Wednesday, but said she was on her way to the Norwegian capital and would arrive soon to embrace her family for the first time in months.",
      "Machado, who's fight against the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom she, the U.S. and many other nations consider an illegitimate leader, has forced her to live in hiding, last appeared in public 11 months ago. Her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado, accepted the prize on her behalf at the Oslo ceremony, saying her mother would return to Venezuela soon after coming to Norway on Wednesday.",
      "\"Freedom is not something we wait for, but something we become,\" the younger Machado told those gathered for the ceremony in a speech written by her mother. \"Loving a country means taking responsibility for its future.\"",
      "\"What we Venezuelans can offer the world is the lesson forged through this long and difficult journey: that to have democracy, we must be willing to fight for freedom,\" Machado said.",
      "The Nobel institute posted audio on its YouTube channel of a phone call between Machado and the institute's director J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, in which she told him she was on her way to Oslo, but wouldn't make the award ceremony.",
      "\"On behalf of the Venezuelan people, once again, I want to thank the Norwegian Nobel Committee for this immense recognition to the fight of our people for democracy and freedom. We feel very emotional and very honored, and that's why I am very sad and very sorry to tell you that I won't be able to arrive in time for the ceremony,\" she said in the call, adding: \"But I will be in Oslo and I'm on my way to Oslo right now.\"",
      "\"As soon as I arrive, I will be able to embrace all my family and my children that I've have not seen for two years, and so many Venezuelans, Norwegians, that I know that share our struggle and our fight. So, thank you very much and I'll see you very soon.\"",
      "Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken\u00a0said four days ago\u00a0that Machado confirmed to him that she would attend the ceremony, though he said at the time that, \"given the security situation, we cannot say more about the date or how she will arrive.\"",
      "Prominent Latin American figures attended Wednesday's ceremony in a signal of solidarity with Machado. Among those expected were Argentine President Javier Milei, Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa, Panama's President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino and Paraguayan President Santiago Pe\u00f1a.",
      "Machado has been living in hiding and has not been seen in public since Jan. 9, when she was briefly detained after joining supporters in a protest in Caracas, Venezuela's capital. The 58-year-old's win for her struggle to achieve a democratic transition in her South American nation was announced on Oct. 10, and she was described as a woman \"who keeps the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.\"",
      "Machado won an opposition primary election and intended to challenge President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in last year's presidential election, but the government barred her from running for office. Retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez took her place.",
      "The lead-up to the July 28, 2024 election saw widespread repression, including disqualifications, arrests and human rights violations. That increased after the country's National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared the incumbent the winner.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez sought asylum in Spain last year after a Venezuelan court issued a warrant for his arrest.",
      "U.N. human rights officials and many independent rights groups have expressed concerns about the situation in Venezuela, and called for Maduro to be held accountable for the crackdown on dissent.",
      "Five past Nobel Peace Prize laureates were detained or imprisoned at the time of the award, according to the prize's official website, most recently Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi in 2023 and Belarusian human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski in 2022.",
      "The others were Liu Xiaobo of China in 2010, Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar in 1991 and Carl von Ossietzky of Germany in 1935.",
      "\"There is a long tradition that when a Peace Prize laureate cannot be present, close family members represent them,\" Harpviken said. \"That happened with Narges Mohammadi, and with Ales Bialiatski; both were imprisoned at the time. And the same will happen with Maria Corina Machado today. The daughter will deliver the statement her mother has written.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 07:33:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Archaeologists finished excavating foundations of the ancient wall that surrounded Jerusalem when the story of Hanukkah took place.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have finished uncovering the longest continuous remains of an ancient wall that encircled Jerusalem, including possible evidence of a 2,100-year-old ceasefire between warring kingdoms.",
      "Last week, archaeologists finished excavating the most complete part ever discovered of the foundations of the walls, which surrounded Jerusalem during the time of the Hasmonean Kingdom, when the story of Hanukkah took place. The discovery comes almost exactly one year after a rare collection of ancient coins was unearthed by Israeli researchers, who called the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "In Hebrew, Hanukkah means \"dedication,\" and the holiday marks the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the second century B.C., after a small group of Jewish fighters liberated it from occupying foreign forces, and the Hasmonean Kingdom that followed.",
      "Jews celebrate the eight-day holiday, which this year begins on Dec. 14, with the ritual of lighting a nightly candle, in honor of the tiny supply of ritually pure oil that they found in the temple that lasted for eight nights instead of just one. Many also eat fried foods such as potato pancakes, called latkes, to memorialize this miraculously long-lasting oil.",
      "The Hasmonean wall foundation, whose excavation was finished last week in Jerusalem, was likely built a few decades after the story of Hanukkah by the same rulers. It's almost 50 meters (164 feet) long, around half the length of a football field, and around 5 meters (16 feet) wide. It held walls, which according to estimations and some historical writings, were taller than the current walls surrounding Jerusalem's Old City.",
      "Much of the current walls surrounding Jerusalem's Old City date back hundreds of years to the Ottoman Era.",
      "The Hasmonean walls encircled an area much larger than the current Old City of Jerusalem, with 60 watchtowers along the wall that were more than 10 meters (33 feet) tall, according to ancient writings. The part recently uncovered is one of the longest sections found intact from the foundation of the Hasmonean walls.",
      "Separation wall and ceasefire",
      "One of the most interesting aspects of the foundation was that the wall above it seems to have been purposefully and uniformly dismantled to a uniform height, not chaotically destroyed by the ravages of time or war, said Dr. Amit Re'em, one of the lead archaeologists for the project from the Israel Antiquities Authority.",
      "Experts wondered why any leader would take apart a perfectly good security wall in an area that was constantly threatened by invasion.",
      "In 132 or 133 B.C., Hellenistic King Antiochus the Seventh, an heir to the Antiochus the Fourth from the story of Hanukkah, laid siege to Jerusalem and the Judean Kingdom, according to ancient Jewish historian Flavius Josephus.",
      "As the Judean army struggled, Jewish king John Hyrcanus I decided to strike a deal with Antiochus. He raided King David's tomb for 3,000 talents of silver and offered 500 hostages, including his own brother, according to the writings of Josephus.",
      "\"Antiochus Sidetes (the Seventh) reached a ceasefire agreement with John Hyrcanus, saying, if you want me to remove my army, you yourself, the Jewish king, must raze to the ground the Hasmonean fortification that you and your father built,\" Re'em said Monday. Josephus' writings state that after Antiochus accepted Hyrcanus' deal, they \"pulled down the walls encircling the city.\"",
      "Other sections of the Hasmonean wall uncovered in other parts of Jerusalem weren't dismantled, so it could have just been one section that was dismantled, possibly to provide a foundation for Herod's palace, Peleg-Barkat explained. Its unlikely that Jerusalem was left unprotected without any security walls for more than a century, she said.",
      "Wall under a prison",
      "The current section of the wall was uncovered underneath an abandoned wing of the building known as the Kishleh, which was built in 1830 as a military base. The wing was used as a prison, including by the British up until the 1940s, and the walls were covered with graffiti carved by prisoners in English, Hebrew and Arabic. The remnants of the iron bars of the cells are still visible in the ceiling.",
      "Most of the building is still used by the Israeli police today, but one wing was abandoned and later transferred to the Tower of David Museum. Archaeologists first began excavating this wing of the Kishleh in 1999, but violence in Jerusalem during the Second Intifada, which began in 2000, halted the excavations until two years ago.",
      "Archaeologists removed the equivalent of two Olympic swimming pools worth of dirt and debris by hand over the past two years from the hall. The excavations revealed what they believe are Middle Age-era dye pits, likely for fabric dying, and the long section of the Hasmonean wall foundation.",
      "In the coming years, the Tower of David Museum will install a floating glass floor over the ruins and use the hall as one of its new galleries in the Schulich Wing of Archaeology, Art and Innovation. The renovations of this section are expected to take at least two years, now that the archaeological dig has concluded.",
      "Last year's \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle\"",
      "Almost exactly one year ago, in December 2024, Israeli researchers discovered a rare collection of ancient coins on the third day of Hanukkah, calling the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "The coins were more than 2,000 years old and believed to belong to King Alexander Jannaeus, the second ruler of the Hasmonean dynasty. Archaeologists found the hoard of about 160 of the coins during excavations in the Jordan Valley, which runs between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the eastern border of Jordan.",
      "The ancient coins were unearthed on the third day of Hanukkah. Researchers noted the significance of that timing, since Alexander Jannaeus descended from leaders of a revolt in 167 B.C.E. that the Talmud says led to the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem and the first celebration of the Hanukkah holiday.",
      "More recently, last month, archaeologists discovered evidence of an ancient religious practice in northern Israel in addition to a wine press dating back roughly 5,000 years \u2014 one of the oldest ever uncovered in the country.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 07:30:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A genetic mutation that carries a 90% cancer risk has been passed on by an unwitting sperm donor to dozens of children, a Europe-wide investigation has revealed.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Sperm from a donor who unknowingly carried a cancer-causing gene has been used to conceive nearly 200 babies across Europe, an investigation by 14 European public service broadcasters, including CBS News' partner network BBC News, has revealed.",
      "Some children conceived using the sperm have already died from cancer, and the vast majority of those who inherited the gene will develop cancer in their lifetimes, geneticists said.",
      "The man carrying the gene passed screening checks before he became a donor at the European Sperm Bank when he was a student in 2005. His sperm has been used by women trying to conceive for 17 years across multiple countries.",
      "The cancer-causing mutation occurred in the donor's TP53 gene \u2014 which prevents cells in the body from turning cancerous \u2014  \u00a0before his birth, according to the investigation. It causes Li Fraumeni syndrome, which gives affected people a 90% chance of developing cancers, particularly during childhood, as well as breast cancer in later life.",
      "Up to 20% of the donor's sperm contained the mutated TP53 gene. Any children conceived with affected sperm will have the dangerous mutation in every cell of their body.",
      "\"It is a dreadful diagnosis,\" cancer geneticist Clare Turnbull told the BBC. \"It's a very challenging diagnosis to land on a family. There is a lifelong burden of living with that risk. It's clearly devastating.\"",
      "How was the discovery made?",
      "The affected donor sperm was discovered when doctors seeing children with cancers linked to sperm donation raised concerns at this year's European Society of Human Genetics.",
      "At the time, 23 children with the genetic mutation had been discovered, out of 67 children linked to the donor. Ten of those children with the mutation had already been diagnosed with cancer.",
      "Freedom of Information requests submitted by journalists across multiple countries revealed at least 197 children were affected, though it is not known how many inherited the genetic mutation.",
      "More affected children could be discovered as more data becomes available.",
      "\"We have some children that have developed already two different cancers and some of them have already died at a very early age,\" Edwige Kasper, a cancer geneticist at France's Rouen University Hospital, told journalists.",
      "The European Sperm Bank told CBS News that it does not ship to the United States due to U.S. regulations. A representative said the bank does work with with sperm banks in both Canada and Mexico.",
      "How did the sperm get used by women all over Europe?",
      "The donor sperm was sold by the European Sperm Bank in Denmark to 67 fertility clinics in 14 countries.",
      "Nations have their own regulations about how many times a donor's sperm can be used domestically, but there is no international law restricting how many times a donor's sperm can be used worldwide.",
      "It appears that some national laws were breached.",
      "In Belgium, where sperm from a single donor is supposed to be used by a maximum of six families, 53 children were born to 38 different women using sperm from the donor with the genetic mutation, the investigation found.",

    "summary": "President Trump helped end a simmering conflict between Cambodia and Thailand in the summer, but the ceasefire didn't last long.",
    "story": [
      "Surin, Thailand\u00a0\u2014 Renewed border fighting between Thailand and Cambodia showed no signs of abating Wednesday, leaving hundreds of thousands of displaced people in both countries living in strained conditions as more flooded into temporary shelters. Remarks from leaders in both countries suggest little immediate momentum for a new halt to the violence, though President Trump says he will make a phone call to stop the fighting.",
      "Associated Press reporters on the Thai side of the border heard sounds of outgoing, indirect fire Wednesday.",
      "About 400,000 people have been evacuated from affected areas in Thailand and around 700 schools closed while fighting was ongoing in four border provinces, Thai military spokesperson Rear Adm. Surasant Kongsiri said Wednesday.",
      "Cambodia evacuated more than 127,000 villagers and hundreds of schools closed, the defense ministry said.",
      "Thailand's military announced that casualties this week include five soldiers killed and dozens wounded. Cambodia said seven civilians died and 20 others were wounded, though it did not update those figures on Wednesday.",
      "There is not yet a clear path to peace as Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul vowed to continue to fight and Cambodia's powerful Senate President Hun Sen promised a fierce response.",
      "A knock-on effect of the fighting and bad blood between the nations was Cambodia's withdrawal of its entire team from the 33rd Southeast Asian Games, which began Tuesday in Thailand. A Wednesday announcement from the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia said it regretted the action but the families of competitors were concerned about their safety.",
      "Trump says he'll \"make a phone call\" to stop the fighting",
      "The new, widespread fighting followed a skirmish Sunday that wounded two Thai soldiers and derailed a ceasefire pushed by President Trump that had ended armed combat in July. Mr. Trump has repeatedly included the conflict among those he says he has ended.",
      "The five days of fighting over territorial disputes left dozens dead on both sides and forced the evacuation of thousands of civilians. The ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through by pressure from Mr. Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges from the two nations unless they agreed.",
      "Late Tuesday at a Pennsylvania political event, Mr. Trump said he would use his sway to end the renewed combat.",
      "\"Tomorrow I'll have to make a phone call,\" he said. \"Who else could say, 'I'm going to make a phone call and stop a war between two very powerful countries, Thailand and Cambodia?'\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier called on the two sides to live up to the commitments made at an October meeting in Malaysia that reaffirmed the July ceasefire and called for removing heavy weapons from the border, coordinating removal of land mines and other steps.",
      "Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura said Wednesday that there had not yet been any contact with the United States on the matter. He added that Thailand will not likely accept if another third party proposes to mediate since \"the line has been crossed.\"",
      "The ceasefire was fragile from the start as both nations carried on a bitter propaganda war and minor incidents of cross-border violence continued.",
      "Thailand deployed jet fighters to carry out airstrikes on what it says are military targets, while Cambodia's most fearsome weapons are BM-21 rocket launchers with a range of 19-25 miles. They are capable of firing salvos of 40 rockets at a time and, mounted on trucks, they are less vulnerable to attack.",
      "A Thai army statement said Cambodia on Tuesday launched approximately 125 salvos from BM-21 launchers totaling about 5,000 rockets and that some had hit civilian areas, though no casualties were reported.",
      "Thai evacuees stuck in shelters and anxious about what comes next",
      "Away from the battlefronts, anxious evacuees are the most visible sign of the crisis.",
      "In a gymnasium in the northeastern Thai city of Surin, around 550 people are waiting out the combat, many having hurriedly fled after the first shots were fired Sunday.",
      "Officials have provided food and diversions for children. The cooler, winter temperatures have kept the situation in the shelter bearable, but there is inevitable boredom and concern about what they left behind, including homes, valuables and animals.",
      "Thidarat Homhual, a 37-year-old farmer in the shelter with her family, said her mind is on cows, ducks, four dogs and nine cats left to fend for themselves.",
      "\"We are behind the front line. We can live like this. It's okay,\" she said. \"But I want it to be over. I miss my pets. I really miss my pets, all the animals at home. I can't really put it into words.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 04:32:59 -0500",
    "summary": "At least three oil tankers have been hit by explosions in what appears to be a stepped up unilateral effort by Ukraine to sink Russia's sanctions-dodging oil sales.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine has struck at least two oil tankers off the coasts of Turkey and West Africa in a campaign against Russia's so-called shadow fleet, months after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for Kyiv's partners to strengthen their response to the vessels that Moscow uses to evade international sanctions and continue selling its natural resources.",
      "Ukraine has previously targeted fuel tankers and infrastructure in Russian ports and on land as part of its efforts to undermine the crucial source of Moscow's war funding, but the recent attacks have taken place outside Russia's territorial waters.",
      "Europe and the U.S. have sanctioned hundreds of ships in the shadow fleet, accusing them of violating bans on Russian oil sales, transporting stolen Ukrainian grain, and even suspected of spying on or damaging underwater telecommunications cables and pipelines.",
      "In October, Zelenskyy said Kyiv's intelligence service was providing information to European partners and \"expect that efforts to counter Russian interference will be significantly strengthened.\"",
      "As of Tuesday, the sanctioned crude oil tanker Kairos was grounded off the coast of NATO member Bulgaria after a Turkish tugboat that had been towing it from Turkey's exclusive economic zone in the Black Sea separated from the vessel in Bulgarian waters, according to state-owned Bulgarian news agency BTA.",
      "Kairos and another sanctioned oil tanker, the Virat, were both hit by Ukrainian \"Sea Baby\" drones in the Black Sea in separate attacks at the end of November, sources in the SBU told CBS News on Tuesday. The sources said the attacks were a joint operation between the 13th Main Directorate of Military Counterintelligence of Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency and the Ukrainian Navy.",
      "\"The SBU continues to take active steps to curtail Russia's financial capabilities to wage war against Ukraine,\" an SBU source said. \"Sea Baby naval drones disabled ships that could transport oil worth almost $70 million and helped the Kremlin circumvent international sanctions.\"",
      "The SBU sources provided a video showing the moment the Sea Baby drones struck both ships. CBS News has confirmed the ships visible in the video matches publicly available photos of the Kairos and Virat. The SBU officials said both tankers were critically damaged and \"taken out of service\" by the strikes.",
      "Publicly available ship tracking data corroborated the BTA report suggesting the Turkish tug had separated from the tanker six miles from Bulgaria's coast. The Kairos was stranded on Tuesday off Ahtopol, on Bulgaria's southern Black Sea coast, without heat or electricity, according to BTA.",
      "The Bulgarian Navy airlifted several crew members to shore, but authorities had been unable to tow the oil tanker to safety as of Tuesday due to poor weather conditions.",
      "Late last month, the technical manager of another tanker, the Mersin, said the vessel was impacted by a series of explosions while anchored off the coast of Senegal. The crew was rescued, according to Senegalese officials, and the vessel's technical manager, Besiktas Shipping, said seawater flooded into the engine room but the ship remained \"safe\" and posed no safety or navigational risks.",
      "The Mersin remained stranded with some 30,000 tons of diesel fuel on board, however, according to the African Security Analysis think tank.",
      "The tanker departed from the Russian port of Taman on Aug. 21 and arrived in Senegal in late September, where it has remained at anchor, according to open-source data from MarineTraffic. While the Mersin is not currently among the vessels sanctioned by the U.S., ships operated by BesiktasShipping have engaged in highly risky ship-to-ship crude oil transfers while anchored, according to the sanctions compliance monitoring organization OpenSanctions.",
      "Video circulating on social media, dated Nov. 30, shows the Mersin sinking. CBS News has not confirmed the source of the video, but the oil tanker's partially-submerged name is visible in the clip, seemingly recorded from a passing vessel.",
      "Ukrainian officials have not publicly confirmed any involvement in any of the explosions in the Black Sea or off the coast of Africa, all of which occurred within a few days. On Dec. 3, Besiktas Shipping said it was immediately ceasing all \"Russia related voyages.\"",
      "While insisting that it always complied and complies with restrictions on Russian oil shipments, the company said \"the security situation in the region has escalated considerably,\" and \"we have concluded that the risks posed to our vessels and crew have become untenable.\"",
      "European nations have imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on hundreds of vessels they say are part of the Russian shadow fleet, but a planned European Union-wide move to allow national authorities to board and inspect suspected ships has yet to materialize.",
      "Shadow fleet vessels have also been linked to drone sightings at European airports, including last week when unidentified drones breached Irish airspace during a visit from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "The EU and America's European NATO allies have issued increasing warnings about Russia's alleged hybrid warfare tactics in recent months, including the drone airspace incursions and sabotage operations across the continent and at sea.",

      "The unnamed patient reportedly performed activities such as cutting, grinding and polishing, which can generate crystalline silica dust. When inhaled, this dust scars lung tissue and can lead to silicosis, DPH said.",
      "The disease is preventable but irreversible and progressive, officials said. Symptoms include a persistent cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. Because there is often a long latency period between exposure and symptom onset, diagnoses are frequently delayed, according to DPH.",

      "Men account for higher rates of nearly all major chronic diseases \u2014 yet nearly two-thirds admit that they avoid going to the doctor for as long as possible. (iStock)",
      "1. Complete blood count (CBC)",
      "Dr. Andrea Caamano, M.D., a New Jersey physician specializing in endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism, recommends that this blood test is performed yearly for men in their 40s and older.",
      "\"It tells us the state of a patient\u2019s red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and tells of infection, allergic reactions, inflammation, anemia and clotting disorders,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "WHY MOST PEOPLE FALL OFF A \u2018HEALTH CLIFF\u2019 AT 75 \u2014 AND 5 WAYS TO AVOID THE DROP",
      "The CBC is especially important in men undergoing testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), as testosterone stimulates the production of red blood cells \u2014 and an overproduction will raise the risk of clots and high blood pressure, according to the doctor.",
      "\"The test\u2019s only limitation is that it does not tell us why something is happening,\" Caamano said. \"It will give us values, but not a reason when they are outside normal limits.\"",
      "\"If I could give one message to every man over 40: Test, don\u2019t guess.\"",
      "Health agencies such as the CDC, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and World Health Organization do not recommend a CBC test for every person without symptoms, but they do recommend it for people experiencing symptoms like anemia, infection, inflammation, fatigue, bleeding or bruising, or for those with a known medical condition.",
      "2. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)",
      "This blood test is commonly performed yearly, according to Caamano, especially for men using TRT.",
      "\"This blood test measures metabolic and organ function, giving information about the kidneys and liver, and electrolyte and glucose state,\" she said. \"It is important to catch any organ issue that can pop up on its own, or that can be age- or medication-induced.\"",
      "The CDC and USPSTF recommend that all adults 18 and over should undergo routine blood pressure screening. High blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (iStock)",
      "The test can also catch things like liver and kidney disease, pre-diabetes, full-blown diabetes and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to blood pressure fluctuations and heart rhythm issues, according to the doctor.",
      "Caamano recommends that men using TRT get a baseline CMP, then get monitored every three to six months in the first year of treatment and then yearly. Organizations like the USPSTF, CDC and WHO, however, only recommend CMPs when evaluating symptoms, monitoring chronic conditions or checking medication safety.",
      "3. Blood pressure",
      "The CDC and USPSTF recommend that all adults 18 and over should undergo routine blood pressure screening. High blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher.",
      "Individuals aged 40 and older \u2014 or those with elevated risk \u2014 are advised to be tested every year, while younger adults with consistently normal results may be screened every three to five years.",
      "LOW TESTOSTERONE SIGNS MEN CAN\u2019T IGNORE \u2014 AND WHAT EXPERTS SAY ABOUT HORMONE THERAPY",
      "\"The use of TRT can increase blood pressure, so it is very important to monitor regularly,\" Caamano said. \"Increased blood pressure can be indicative of cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "4. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score",
      "Dr. Auda Auda, a board-certified physician at Baker Health in New York, names this as his top recommendation to protect against heart disease, which remains the No. 1 cause of death in men over 40.",
      "\"A CAC scan directly measures calcified plaque in the coronary arteries, years before symptoms develop,\" Auda told Fox News Digital. \"For many men, it\u2019s the difference between \u2018normal annual labs\u2019 and a silent, high-risk cardiovascular picture that would otherwise go unnoticed.\"",

      "A high CAC score identifies early coronary atherosclerosis, leading to targeted lifestyle changes, statins and risk modification to help prevent heart attack and stroke, the doctor noted.",
      "The test should be done every five years if the score is 0, or every one to two years if the score is >0, Auda advised.",
      "WANT BETTER HEART HEALTH? START BY TACKLING YOUR WEAKEST LINK, CARDIAC SURGEON SAYS",
      "\"I\u2019ve had multiple men in their 40s with \u2018perfect\u2019 cholesterol come back with CAC scores in the 200-400 range, completely changing their trajectory,\" he shared.",
      "Major health agencies, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA) and USPSTF, recommend CAC scoring for adults who are at intermediate risk of heart disease or when it\u2019s unclear whether they should start statin therapy.",
      "5. Advanced lipid profile",
      "Dr. Jeremy M. Liff, a board-certified neurologist in New York, puts this test at the top of his list.",
      "\"Unlike a standard cholesterol panel, which only gives you HDL (\u2018good\u2019 cholesterol) and LDL (\u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol), the advanced version breaks down the specific types of LDL particles,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"Some LDL particles are far more dangerous than others.\"",
      "\"Insulin resistance influences nearly every major organ, including the liver and the brain.\"",
      "The advanced lipid profile helps to prevent \"catastrophic\" cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, according to the doctor.",
      "\"This test gives men over 40 a much clearer picture of their cardiovascular risk and whether they need major dietary or lifestyle changes,\" he said. \"By identifying dangerous LDL particle types early, men can intervene before plaque buildup becomes life-threatening.\"",
      "The advanced lipid profile helps to prevent \"catastrophic\" cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, according to a doctor. (iStock)",
      "The advanced lipid profile may only need to be done once if the baseline looks excellent, according to the doctor. If results are poor, men should repeat the test every six months under their doctor\u2019s guidance, he advised.",
      "Major health organizations \u2014 including the ACC, AHA, Endocrine Society and USPSTF \u2014 regard advanced lipid profiles as optional decision-support tools rather than standard screening tests.",
      "6. Thyroid function",
      "This blood test can be done yearly to evaluate how well your thyroid gland is functioning, according to Caamano.",
      "\"Issues with thyroid function can lead to mood changes, fatigue, weight changes, palpitations and hair loss,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "The thyroid is often checked when men have symptoms such as fatigue, weight changes, palpitations or hair loss, while some physicians also order it periodically in midlife.",
      "MEN MAY NEED TO WORK TWICE AS HARD AS WOMEN TO PREVENT POTENTIALLY DEADLY DISEASE",
      "The test measures levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is made by the pituitary gland and tells the thyroid how much hormone to produce. It also measures levels of free T4 (the main hormone the thyroid releases) and free T3 (the active form that the body converts T4 into).",
      "Based on these three levels, a doctor can determine whether the thyroid is underactive or overactive.",
      "\"Issues with thyroid function can lead to mood changes, fatigue, weight changes, palpitations and hair loss,\" one doctor cautioned. (iStock)",
      "Major health agencies, such as the USPSTF, American Thyroid Association (ATA) and American College of Physicians, recommend this test for people who are at higher risk of thyroid disease, are experiencing symptoms or have autoimmune conditions.",
      "7. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)",
      "A PSA blood test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by both normal and cancerous cells of the prostate gland.",
      "This test, sometimes along with a digital rectal exam, is used to screen for cancer or enlargement of the prostate, according to Caamano.",
      "EXPERT WARNS OF 'SILENT EPIDEMIC' THAT PUTS MEN\u2019S HEALTH AT SERIOUS RISK",
      "The USPSTF, American Urological Association (AUA) and American Cancer Society (ACS) recommend \"shared decision-making\" for men aged 55 to 69, warning of the risks of false positives, overdiagnosis and overtreatment with the PSA test.",
      "8. Insulin sensitivity test",
      "Some clinicians use additional markers of insulin sensitivity when taking a more proactive approach to metabolic health. These measures can provide insights that go beyond standard tests such as fasting glucose and HbA1c, which reflects average blood glucose over the past two to three months.",
      "\"Insulin resistance influences nearly every major organ, including the liver and the brain,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"It plays a major role in metabolic health, long-term inflammation and future disease risk.\"",
      "Poor insulin sensitivity is closely tied to fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and vascular problems. (iStock)",
      "Poor insulin sensitivity is closely tied to fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and vascular problems, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Detecting it early allows men to make changes that protect long-term organ health, including the brain,\" Liff said. \"Depending on the initial findings, a repeat every six months may be appropriate.\"",
      "Major health agencies, such as the ADA (American Diabetes Association), USPSTF, CDC and WHO, generally recommend screening for diabetes and prediabetes using fasting glucose, HbA1c or a standard oral glucose tolerance test.",
      "9. Hormone levels",
      "Caamano recommends that certain men over 40 get tested for hormones, including total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol, which can be measured in a blood draw.",
      "\"These are done when men are having symptoms such as low libido, fatigue, breast enlargement or when they are using TRT,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "TWO KEY HEART HEALTH METRICS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG YOU'LL LIVE",
      "Consistency is key in hormonal testing, according to the doctor. \"Testosterone should be measured in the morning, as it follows a pattern, peaking in the morning hours,\" Caamano said. \"Hormonal blood levels, along with symptoms, help determine the need for TRT.\"",
      "The Endocrine Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF and the American Urological Association only recommend hormone tests when there are clear symptoms or medical indications.",
      "10. Omega-3 index",
      "Cardiologist Wolfson, who is also founder of Natural Heart Doctor, a holistic cardiology practice, calls this test \"the most powerful predictor of heart attack and sudden death risk\" \u2014 though it\u2019s not yet part of standard screening guidelines for everyone.",
      "Low omega-3 levels, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are associated with a range of medical conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, poor cognition, mood disorders and more, studies have shown.",
      "Omega-3 fatty acids, or fish oil, \"were associated with significant reductions in heart attacks,\" the researchers found. (iStock)",
      "\"The omega-3 index is a direct measurement of omega-3 levels inside red blood cells, making it far more meaningful than a standard blood omega-3 test,\" Wolfson told Fox News Digital.",
      "He recommends that men 40 and older get the test once per year \u2014 \"or every six months if supplementing and optimizing.\"",
      "HEART SURGEON REVEALS WHAT TO EAT (AND NOT EAT) FOR OPTIMAL CARDIAC HEALTH",
      "However, major health agencies like the AHA and the National Institutes of Health do not recommend routine omega-3 index testing for the general population, as the test is mainly used for patients with cardiovascular disease who are already considering omega-3 supplementation.",
      "11. Carotid artery ultrasound",
      "Narrowing of the carotid arteries reduces blood flow to the brain and increases the risk of stroke, according to Liff. The carotid artery ultrasound can reveal problems long before symptoms appear, potentially protecting brain health.",
      "It may be considered in some high-risk men or when a doctor suspects carotid disease.",
      "\"Reduced blood flow from plaque buildup can trigger strokes or transient ischemic attacks,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"Catching the narrowing early allows for treatment, lifestyle changes or close monitoring before a serious event occurs.\"",
      "Narrowing of the carotid arteries reduces blood flow to the brain and increases the risk of stroke, an expert noted. (iStock)",
      "If there is no evidence of disease, Liff recommends repeating the test every few years. \"If narrowing is detected, a specialist should follow the patient more closely,\" he advised.",
      "The USPSTF, AHA, American Stroke Association (ASA) and ACC only recommend the carotid artery ultrasound when there are neurological symptoms or high clinical suspicion of carotid disease based on medical history.",
      "12. Colon cancer screening",
      "The USPSTF, ACS and CDC now recommend screening average-risk adults for colon cancer from the ages of 45 to 75.",
      "Men with a family history of colorectal cancer should begin screenings at 40, Caamano noted. Those with a low risk level should begin screenings at 45, via colonoscopy or an at-home stool test.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"A colonoscopy should be done every 10 years unless polyps are found, which then drops the time to every three to five years \u2014 or for those with a family history of colorectal cancer, every five years,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"This screening is super important, as early detection can be lifesaving.\"",
      "13. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)",
      "High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a blood test that detects low levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation in the body.",
      "Wolfson refers to this test as the \"inflammation alarm bell. \"Chronic inflammation is a major driver of heart disease, strokes, cancer, dementia, diabetes and accelerated aging,\" he told Fox News Digital, calling \"hs-CRP \u2018the single best early warning sign.\u2019\"",
      "Dubbed the \"sunshine hormone,\" vitamin D is known to predict health span, according to an expert. (iStock)",
      "The test helps to detect silent cardiovascular inflammation, early artery damage, hidden infections and inflammatory lifestyle triggers, such as poor sleep, stress, alcohol and toxins, Wolfson noted.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "He recommends that men in their 40s and older get the test every six months, or more frequently if levels are elevated or if symptoms are present. Per major health agencies, however, there is insufficient evidence that hs-CRP should be routinely performed unless someone experiences symptoms or is at intermediate cardiovascular risk.",
      "14. Vitamin D",
      "Dubbed the \"sunshine hormone,\" vitamin D is known to predict health span, according to Wolfson.",
      "Low levels are linked to heart disease, cancer, autoimmune conditions, high blood pressure, depression, low testosterone, poor immune resilience and early aging, according to the doctor.",
      "\"It is one of the strongest indicators of lifestyle quality, including sun exposure, sleep habits, metabolic health and inflammation,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Levels may be low in men who avoid the sun or overuse sunscreen.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Wolfson recommends vitamin D testing twice per year, ideally in the winter and summer, to capture seasonal changes.",
      "While many doctors will check vitamin D in midlife, especially if someone has risk factors or related conditions, major health agencies only recommend screenings for people who have symptoms of deficiency or are at higher risk due to medical conditions or certain medications.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Digital asked GOP state Sens. Mark Koran, Julia Coleman, and Michael Kreun about what can be done to clean up the fraud mess in Minneapolis.",
      "MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. \u2013 The massive and sprawling $1 billion welfare-fraud schemes engulfing Minnesota are now casting fresh scrutiny on an old, opaque money-transfer network used by Somali Americans to send remittances back to their loved ones and friends \u2014 a system U.S. officials have warned can be siphoned or taxed by the terrorist group al-Shabaab.",
      "Known as hawala, the centuries-old system moves money without banks, wiring infrastructure or standard documentation, yet it remains a lifeline for families in Somalia, where a national banking system barely exists. The system works by having a sender give money to an agent in the United States, who then instructs a partner in Somalia to pay the recipient directly, with no money ever physically crossing borders.",
      "Hawala functions as an alternative remittance system, relying on trusted agents rather than banks. It is fast, inexpensive and reaches remote regions of Somalia where no formal banking system exists. For many Somali Minnesotans, hawala-linked payouts are the only practical way to support relatives overseas.",

(Abdurashid Abdulle/AFP via Getty Images; Luis Tato/AFP via Getty Images.)",
      "But U.S. officials are sounding the alarm on the system, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announcing last month that the Treasury Department has opened a formal investigation into whether Minnesota taxpayer dollars doled out in the various schemes were diverted into financial channels that may benefit al-Shabaab which imposes taxes, extorts businesses or controls trade routes.",
      "The House Oversight Committee has also launched its own inquiry into the fraud and the potential terror-finance risks, while Minnesota State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson said the concern is serious.",
      "\"Because there\u2019s more than a billion dollars that\u2019s been stolen and a significant portion of those dollars have been directed overseas, there are concerns this money could be either directly or indirectly funding terrorist organizations like al-Shabaab,\" Rasmusson told Fox News Digital.",

      "Remittances are essential for survival in Somalia, where millions rely on money from relatives abroad to meet basic needs in a country where corruption and extremist taxation shape everyday economic life.",
      "Each year, according to the global poverty-fighting organization Oxfam, Somalis living in the United States send about $215 million home each year. Globally, the Somali diaspora sends approximately $1.3 billion, equivalent to 15 to 20 percent of Somalia\u2019s total economic output, according to recent World Bank estimates.",
      "Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Minnesota chapter (CAIR-MN), told Fox News Digital previously that for many Somali Minnesotans, these payments are part of their monthly budgets.",

      "Somali Americans are among the poorest demographics in the United States, yet many face intense pressure to send large parts of their income abroad, even while struggling themselves. The result is a community financially stretched at both ends with hundreds of millions of dollars flowing through a system that becomes vulnerable once funds reach Somalia.",
      "The warnings revive long-standing fears in Minnesota, where roughly 20 young Somali Americans left in the late 2000s to join al-Shabaab \u2014 including Shirwa Ahmed, who became the first known American Islamist suicide bomber in 2008. Last year, Abdisatar Ahmed Hassan, 23, pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to ISIS after twice trying to travel to Somalia.",

      "In Minneapolis' Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, known as \"Little Mogadishu\" due to its dense Somali population, Fox News Digital observed at least three wire-transfer storefronts in the area on Wednesday, while the only brick-and-mortar bank was an Associated Bank branch. Inside the wire-transfer storefronts, workers declined to speak on the record.",
      "Those money wire stores operate legally in the United States and are licensed money-service providers. They have never been accused of wrongdoing and are not hawala shops and their role is to initiate the U.S. side of the transfer. They function similarly to Western Union counters, collecting cash from customers and sending the transaction data overseas.",
      "The hawala system typically begins only after the money reaches Somalia, where limited banking options mean local agents pay out remittances from their own cash reserves and settle accounts privately. Experts say this Somalia-side leg of the process is where transfers often shift into hawala networks, becoming vulnerable to corruption or extremist taxation in regions controlled by al-Shabaab.",
      "Anna Mahjar-Barducci, a Middle East analyst with the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), explained why hawala dominates Somalia\u2019s economy.",
      "\"Hawala reaches places Western Union cannot. Much of Somalia, especially rural areas, has no formal banks or Western Union locations, but hawala agents exist almost everywhere,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "NUTRITION PROGRAM\u2019S LAWSUIT TRIGGERS MN EDUCATION DEPT TO EASE OVERSIGHT, OPENING DOOR TO MORE FRAUD",

      "Behind the scenes, operators later settle debts privately through offsetting transactions, trade arrangements or bulk cash shipments \u2014 mechanisms regulators cannot monitor, she said.",
      "Mahjar-Barducci said al-Shabaab\u2019s taxation system is concentrated in south-central Somalia, where the group maintains control or co-governance over rural districts, key transport routes and local markets. Its influence is far weaker in northern Somalia and is largely absent in the autonomous regions of Somaliland and Puntland, with only a limited presence in pockets on the outskirts of major cities like Mogadishu.",
      "However, she noted that even mobile-money systems are vulnerable and that al-Shabaab can compel local shopkeepers to pay a monthly \"license\" fee and a percentage of every transaction they process.",

      "\"In general, in Somalia, corruption affects daily life. Many people need connections or small payments to get services or jobs,\" she said.",
      "\"The diaspora sender typically is unaware of the exact tax,\" she added, noting that even legitimate remittances can lose value through hidden fees, coercion or extremist-controlled toll points.",
      "When it comes to Minnesota\u2019s fraud, she said the risk is real.",
      "\"In theory, once money from fraud is converted into cash, it can move through the same informal channels as ordinary remittances, like hawala.\"",

      "How the ShadyPanda campaign unfolded",
      "The operation included 20 malicious Chrome extensions and 125 on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store. Many first appeared in 2018 with no obvious warning signs. Five years later, the extensions began receiving staged updates that changed their behavior.",
      "Koi Security found that these updates rolled out through each browser's trusted auto-update system. Users did not need to click anything. No phishing. No fake alerts. Just quiet version bumps that slowly turned safe extensions into powerful tracking tools.",

      "WeTab functions as a sophisticated surveillance platform disguised as a productivity tool. (Koi)",
      "What the extensions were doing behind the scenes",
      "Once activated, the extensions injected tracking code into real links to earn revenue from user purchases. They also hijacked searches, redirected queries and logged data for sale and manipulation. ShadyPanda gathered an unusually broad range of personal information, including browsing history, search terms, cookies, keystrokes, fingerprint data, local storage, and even mouse movement coordinates. As the extensions gained credibility in the stores, the attackers pushed a backdoor update that allowed hourly remote code execution. That gave them full browser control, letting them monitor websites visited and exfiltrate persistent identifiers.",
      "Researchers also discovered that the extensions could launch adversary-in-the-middle attacks. This allowed credential theft, session hijacking and code injection on any website. If users opened developer tools, the extensions switched into harmless mode to avoid detection. Google removed the malicious extensions from the Chrome Web Store. We reached out to the company, and a spokesperson confirmed that none of the extensions listed are currently live on the platform.",
      "Meanwhile, a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy, \"We have removed all the extensions identified as malicious on the Edge Add-on store. When we become aware of instances that violate our policies, we take appropriate action that includes, but is not limited to, the removal of prohibited content or termination of our publishing agreement.\"",

      "ShadyPanda ran for years without raising alarms and proved how creative attackers can be. A trusted extension can shift into spyware through a silent update, which makes it even more important to stay alert to changes in browser behavior. You protect yourself by installing fewer extensions, checking them from time to time and watching for anything that feels out of place. Small steps help lower your exposure and reduce the chances that hidden code can track what you do online.",

      "A breakthrough that turns one donor cornea into hundreds",
      "The cornea came from a healthy deceased donor and was then multiplied in the lab. Researchers used the cultured cells to print about 300 transparent implants with Precise Bio's regenerative platform.",
      "Their system builds a layered structure that looks and behaves like a natural cornea. It is designed to provide clarity, strength and long-term function.",
      "HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT",
      "Since donor shortages prevent millions from receiving sight-saving care each year, this approach could transform access. Many patients in developed countries wait only a few days for a transplant, while others wait years due to low tissue availability. A single donor cornea that can create hundreds of implants changes that equation.",
      "The surgery used a fully 3D printed corneal implant grown from cultured human cells and restored sight to a legally blind patient. (Rambam Eye Institute)",
      "The surgery that proved it works",
      "Professor Michael Mimouni, director of the Cornea Unit in the Department of Ophthalmology at Rambam Eye Institute, led the surgical team. He described the moment as unforgettable because the lab-grown implant restored sight to a real patient for the first time.",
      "He says, \"What this platform shows and proves is that in the lab, you can expand human cells. Then print them on any layer you need, and that tissue will be sustainable and work. We can hopefully reduce waiting times for all kinds of patients waiting for all kinds of transplants.\"",
      "The procedure is part of an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial that assesses safety and tolerability in people with corneal endothelial disease. This achievement reflects years of work across research labs, operating rooms and industry. It also shows how coordinated teams can push new treatments from concept to clinical reality.",
      "How the science fits into a bigger future",
      "The breakthrough will have a permanent home in Rambam's upcoming Helmsley Health Discovery Tower. The new Eye Institute will consolidate care, training and research under one roof. It aims to speed the move from emerging science to real-world treatment for patients across Northern Israel and beyond.",

      "Professor Michael Mimouni led the surgical team at Rambam Eye Institute's Cornea Unit. (Rambam Eye Institute)",

      "If corneal disease affects someone in your family, this work brings new hope. Donor tissue may continue to play a role in many regions, but lab-grown implants offer a way to expand access where shortages hold patients back. The success of this first transplant also suggests a future where regenerative medicine supports many types of tissue repair.",
      "This milestone also shows how long scientific breakthroughs take to reach real patients. The first 3D printed cornea design appeared in 2018 and only now reached human use. Even so, the progress feels fast when the result is restored sight.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This successful transplant marks a turning point for eye care. It suggests a world where the limits of donor supply do not decide who receives sight-saving surgery. As more trial results arrive, we will see how far this technology can scale and which patients stand to benefit first.",

      "Scam emails posing as MetaMask alerts are tricking users into revealing their crypto wallet details. (Photographer: Wei Leng Tay/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What is MetaMask and why scammers love it",
      "MetaMask is a popular crypto wallet and browser extension that lets you store tokens and connect to blockchain apps on networks such as Ethereum. Because MetaMask is widely known and trusted, criminals impersonate it in phishing campaigns that ask users to \"verify\" wallets and then harvest recovery phrases or keys.",
      "What makes this email a wallet verification scam",
      "The scam email copies MetaMask visuals and even routes through a Zendesk address to look more professional, yet the \"Verify Wallet Ownership\" button points to an unrelated domain that has nothing to do with MetaMask. That mismatch between branding and destination is a major red flag in crypto phishing attacks. It also relies on classic pressure tactics and vague corporate language. The body reads:",
      "Dear Valued User,As part of our ongoing commitment to account security, we require verification to confirm ownership of your wallet.This essential security measure helps protect your assets and maintain the integrity of our platform.Action Required By: December 03, 2025Your prompt attention to this verification will help ensure uninterrupted access to your account and maintain the highest level of security protection.",
      "Phrases like\u00a0\"Dear Valued User,\"\u00a0\"essential security measure\" and \"Action Required By\" are common in phishing emails that pretend to be MetaMask and threaten restrictions if you do not comply. Genuine MetaMask support will direct you to metamask.io or official apps and will never ask you to reveal your secret recovery phrase through a link in an unsolicited email.",
      "In this case, the message even claims to come from \"\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io (Support@\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io)\" <support@z3nbetting.zendesk.com>. That display name looks like MetaMask Support, but the real sending address is an unrelated Zendesk subdomain, which is a classic red flag. MetaMask explains that legitimate support messages only come from specific official addresses, so anything else should be treated as a scam and ignored.",
      "Why mention Zendesk can be misleading",
      "Zendesk is a legitimate customer support platform that many companies use to manage tickets and notifications. Scammers sometimes route fake alerts through such services or spoof similar addresses, so messages look like real support tickets, which can fool users who associate Zendesk branding with trust.",
      "In this case, the presence of a Zendesk-style address does not make the message safe because the link still leads away from MetaMask's official website and asks you to react to manufactured urgency.",

      "Steps to stay safe from wallet verification scam emails",
      "Taking the right precautions can protect your digital wallet and personal data from scammers.",
      "Avoid clicking buttons or links in unexpected wallet verification emails, even if they show the MetaMask logo. Instead, open your browser and type metamask.io yourself or use the official mobile app to check for any real alerts. Also, install strong antivirus software to detect malicious links, fake sites or malware that tries to capture your keystrokes.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Always confirm that the address bar shows MetaMask's official domain or your wallet provider's genuine site before you sign in. If an email link sends you to a domain that looks odd, close it immediately.",
      "Never enter your secret recovery phrase, password or private keys on a site you reached by email. MetaMask support will not ask for that information, and anyone who gets it can empty your wallet.",
      "Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) wherever your exchange or related accounts support it, since codes from an app or key add a barrier even if a password leaks. Store backup codes safely offline, so criminals cannot reach them.",

      "Criminals are spoofing Zendesk-style addresses to make fraudulent MetaMask support emails appear legitimate. (Photo by Felix Zahn/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "Data removal services can help reduce exposed personal details from data broker sites that attackers use to target victims by name and email. Less exposed information makes it harder for phishers to craft convincing wallet alerts tailored to you.",

      "Adjust each app's level of access to\u00a0Allow only while using the app,\u00a0Ask every time or\u00a0Deny, depending on what it actually needs to function.",
      "2) Auto-join networks",
      "Your phone remembers Wi-Fi networks you've connected to before, like stores, gyms, hotels, airports or even an old home router and reconnects automatically whenever it detects them again. The problem is that scammers can create look-alike networks with the same name, tricking your phone into joining without you noticing.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Auto-join saves data and speeds things up, but it also removes your control. Your phone could quietly connect to networks you no longer trust or to fake hotspots designed to steal logins, read unencrypted traffic or inject malicious content. Turning off auto-join for places you don't use often keeps you safer from these silent, high-risk connections.",

      "Background permissions let apps run quietly behind the scenes and may use data or track location if not adjusted. (NIC COURY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "3) Push notifications",
      "These are the pop-up alerts or banners you get from apps, even when those apps are closed. Some notifications are helpful (messages, alerts, reminders). Others just bombard you with ads or updates you don't need.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Push notifications can keep you informed, but they also distract you, drain your battery, expose personal details on your lock screen and give apps a way to pull you back in with constant ads or engagement tactics. Managing them reduces noise and limits how much access apps have to your attention and data.",
      "Examples:",
      "Bank fraud alertsWeather warningsSale notifications from a shopping appGames trying to get you to come back",

      "4) Security updates",
      "These are small software updates designed specifically to fix vulnerabilities that scammers or hackers could exploit. They don't add new features; they close holes. Skipping security updates leaves your device exposed. They run quickly, often in the background and keep your phone protected from the latest threats.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Security updates patch weaknesses before attackers can use them, and delaying them gives hackers more time to target your device. Installing them promptly helps block malware, stop data theft and keep your phone safe from new exploits that emerge every month.",
      "Examples:Patches that fix a flaw in your browserUpdates that stop malware from workingProtection against new phishing techniques",

      "5) App Refresh (also known as Background App Refresh)",
      "This is when apps update their content even when you're not using them, refreshing news, updating emails, pulling in notifications or syncing data. It keeps apps \"fresh,\" but also drains more battery and uses more mobile data.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0 Background App Refresh can quietly drain your battery, use mobile data and let apps run more often than they need to. Limiting it gives you more control over what apps do behind the scenes and reduces unnecessary tracking, resource use and surprise data charges.",
      "Examples:",

      "\"I was recently notified by two different banking institutions that someone completed an online application to open a deposit account in my name. Both banks denied the applications and sent me notifications. One bank sent an email and the other sent a letter. Neither bank will share any information with me about what information was submitted or why the applications were denied. I understand why fraudsters try to open credit accounts, but why would they try to open deposit accounts? One bank told me they could not share any information with me about the failed application due to privacy policy and the other bank said they do not save any information from declined applications from non-customers.",
      "Why would banking institutions not capture or share information about declined online applications? As far as I know, the credit bureaus do not collect information about deposit accounts and Early Warning Services only has information from banks that voluntarily report to them. So, how do I respond or react to someone trying to open deposit accounts in my name?

      "Why criminals open deposit accounts",
      "Criminals use deposit accounts for several strategic reasons that help them test stolen data and prepare bigger attacks.",

      "Deposit account fraud often falls outside normal credit monitoring. A service that looks at bank accounts and dark web activity adds extra protection. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even if they cannot share details, ask them to document the attempt on your record. This helps flag future fraud attempts.",
      "Look for debit cards, 1099 forms or bank statements you did not request. Those often reveal when criminals succeed somewhere else.",
      "Next steps",

    "summary": "New study of 10,500+ kids reveals early smartphone ownership linked to depression, obesity, and poor sleep by age 12. Earlier phones mean higher risks.",
    "story": [
      "Jonathan Haidt joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss his new book \"The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.\"",
      "Parents everywhere wrestle with one big question. What is the right age to let a child have a smartphone?",
      "Tweens ask for one long before many adults feel ready. At the same time, researchers keep sounding alarms about how early access may shape health and behavior. Now, a large new study gives parents even more to think about.",
      "Published in Pediatrics, the research tracked more than 10,500 children in the national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. It found strong links between early smartphone ownership and higher odds of depression, obesity and insufficient sleep by age 12. The earlier kids got a phone, the greater their risk.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "What the study reveals about early smartphone ownership",
      "The study compared 12-year-olds who owned smartphones with those who did not. Kids with phones were more likely to show signs of depression, carry extra weight and sleep less than their peers without devices. Researchers noted that these patterns held even after accounting for income, neighborhood, parental monitoring and other factors.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Parents can lower these risks by delaying devices, setting limits and keeping phones out of bedrooms at night. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "They also looked at children who still did not own a phone at age 12. One year later, those who had finally received one showed more mental health concerns and worse sleep than those who still did not have a device. These shifts happened quickly, which raised concerns about how powerful the change can be.",
      "Lead author Dr. Ran Barzilay explained that parents should treat the decision like a real health milestone. A device changes how kids sleep, move and socialize. That combination may create more strain for a 12-year-old than for a 16-year-old who has more maturity and self-regulation.",
      "Why age matters more than many parents expect",
      "The research shows an association, not a direct cause. Yet the patterns match earlier findings. Kids with smartphones often stay up later, scroll more and move less. That mix can disrupt physical health and emotional well-being. Adolescence is a sensitive stage when small shifts in sleep or mood can have long-lasting effects.",
      "Experts also pointed out how nearly every teen now has smartphone access. That makes the decision even harder for families who want to delay. Still, researchers say the data is strong enough to guide parents toward waiting when possible. Parents do not need perfect evidence to choose a slower timeline.",
      "Pediatric mental health experts warn that a smartphone is not a simple tool. It opens the entire internet with no natural limits. Families need clear rules and protections and those steps require real work from adults. Many parents feel pressure to hand over a device early, yet the expert urged families to trust their instincts when deciding the timing.",
      "The sleep connection families cannot ignore",
      "Most experts agree that phones disrupt sleep. A large share of preteens keep devices in their bedrooms, which leads to late-night scrolling and overnight notifications. Even the glow of the screen can make it harder to fall asleep.",
      "Researchers who study adolescent sleep and screen habits have found that many 11- to 12-year-olds keep devices within reach at night, and a notable share report being awakened by notifications. Experts in this field urge parents to move phones out of bedrooms overnight because better sleep can reduce some of the risks tied to early smartphone access.",
      "EVEN THE FUTURE KING DISCOVERS SMARTPHONES ARE A ROYAL PAIN FOR KIDS AND PARENTS",
      "Researchers found that kids who got phones sooner showed more mental health strain within a year. (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)",
      "The challenge is consistency. Many parents struggle to set rules when screens support school work, friendships and safety. Yet researchers stress that even one boundary, like no phones in bedrooms, can protect sleep and reduce stress.",
      "How parents can use this information right now",
      "No one wants to shame parents who already gave their kids a phone. Many families made the decision for safety or communication needs. The study does not claim that every early smartphone user will face health issues. It simply highlights patterns worth considering before making the call. Parents can use these insights to create a healthier plan.",
      "Readiness is more than age. Look for consistent responsibility with chores, schoolwork and device-free rules on other screens.",
      "Kids follow rules when they understand why they exist. Set limits that work for your household and adjust them as schedules and needs change.",
      "Nighttime use and notifications interrupt sleep. A \"charging station\" in the kitchen or living room solves this fast.",
      "Short regular check-ins work better than one long conversation. Keep the tone open and supportive.",

      "Elite universities like Harvard, Princeton and Columbia spend fortunes on research, talent and digital infrastructure. Even then, they've become easy targets for attackers who see massive databases filled with personal information and donation records as a goldmine. Over the past few months, breaches across Ivy League campuses have exposed the same problem. These institutions handle huge amounts of sensitive data, but their internal defenses often don't match the scale of what they store. That pattern brings us to Harvard's newest incident, which exposed a database of alumni, donors, some students and faculty to hackers.",

      "Elite universities hold massive troves of personal and financial data that make them irresistible targets for attackers. (Photo by Aaron M. Sprecher/Getty Images)",
      "A phone phishing attack unlocks Harvard's data",
      "Harvard confirmed that a database tied to alumni, donors, faculty and some students was accessed by an unauthorized party. This happened after a phone phishing attack tricked someone into giving the attacker a way into the system.",
      "\"On Tuesday, November 18, 2025, Harvard University discovered that information systems used by Alumni Affairs and Development were accessed by an unauthorized party as a result of a phone-based phishing attack,\" the university said in a notification posted on its website. \"The University acted immediately to remove the attacker's access to our systems and prevent further unauthorized access.\"",
      "The exposed data includes personal contact details, donation histories and other records tied to the university's fundraising and alumni operations. For Harvard, a school that routinely raises more than a billion dollars a year, this database is one of its most valuable assets, which makes the breach even more serious.",
      "This is also the second time Harvard has had to investigate a breach in recent months. In October, it looked into reports that its data was caught up in a broader hacking campaign targeting Oracle customers. That earlier warning already showed that the school sits in a high-risk category. This latest breach only confirms it.",

      "Ivy League schools are in a growing crisis",
      "Harvard isn't alone here. Ivy League campuses have seen a wave of incidents that line up almost back-to-back. Princeton reported on Nov. 15 that one of its databases tied to alumni, donors, students and community members was compromised.",
      "The University of Pennsylvania said on Oct. 31 that information systems connected to its development and alumni activities were accessed without permission. Columbia has been dealing with an even larger fallout. A breach in June exposed the personal data of roughly 870,000 people, including students and applicants.",
      "These attacks show how universities have become predictable targets. They store identities, addresses, financial records and donor information. They also run sprawling IT systems where a single mistake, a weak password or a convincing phone call can create an entry point.",
      "Hackers know this, and they strike repeatedly. The recent cluster of Ivy League breaches suggests that attackers are mapping these environments, looking for shared weaknesses that appear again and again.",

      "You can't stop a university or company from being breached, but you can make sure that your own information is harder to exploit. These steps help you reduce the fallout when your data ends up in the wrong hands.",
      "Using 2FA gives your accounts an extra layer of security. Even if someone steals your password in a breach, they still need the one-time code from your phone or authentication app. It blocks most casual attempts and forces attackers to work much harder.",
      "A password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every site you use. This keeps one compromised password from unlocking everything else. It also removes the stress of remembering dozens of logins, so you don't cut corners.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "You can request takedowns from data broker sites, delete old accounts and trim what you share publicly. When your information isn't scattered across the internet, attackers have a much harder time piecing together your identity.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Many attackers rely on old flaws in operating systems, browsers and apps. Regular updates patch these holes and shut down the most common attack paths. If you're someone who delays updates, turning on automatic updates helps.",
      "Use alias email addresses for banking, education, shopping and newsletters. If one of them gets exposed, it won't automatically give attackers a map of your entire digital life. It makes targeted scams much harder to pull off, and also stops attackers from stealing your identity. By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",

      "You might also want to consider an identity theft protection service to be on the safe side. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Harvard's latest breach adds to a growing list of cyberattacks that show how vulnerable top universities have become. Even the most well-funded institutions aren't keeping pace with modern threats. When a simple phone phishing call can open the door to sensitive data tied to donors, alumni and students, it's clear that these campuses need stronger defenses and more proactive monitoring. Until that happens, you can expect more headlines like this and more investigations after the damage is already done.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Air taxis keep gaining momentum, yet one challenge keeps resurfacing: many cities have few places for them to land. AutoFlight believes it has an answer. The company introduced a zero-carbon water vertiport that moves across rivers, lakes or coastal zones. This solar-powered platform works as a mobile hub for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and aims to remove one of the biggest barriers to growth.",

      "THE WORLD'S FIRST FLYING CAR IS READY FOR TAKEOFF",
      "AutoFlight\u2019s solar-powered water vertiport shows how air taxis could finally gain flexible landing spots. (AutoFlight)",
      "The landing bottleneck that held air taxis back",
      "eVTOL air taxis promise quick trips that jump over traffic and turn long drives into short flights. That idea first appeared in the 1940s and '50s, when helicopter passenger services launched in the U.S. and Britain. Those early attempts faded because they could land in only a handful of places. Rooftops and scattered piers created new congestion points. Without enough landing pads, the entire system stalled.",
      "AutoFlight's new floating vertiport flips the model. Instead of forcing cities to build fixed sites that take years to complete, the vertiport travels to the aircraft.",
      "PENNSYLVANIA BILL SEEKS TO LEGALIZE FLYING CARS",
      "The mobile platform supports fast charging and takeoffs for several eVTOL aircraft in real-world conditions. (AutoFlight)",
      "Inside the zero-carbon water vertiport",
      "The vertiport sits on a self-propelled barge with a deck lined with solar panels. It uses clean energy to charge eVTOLs without relying on grid power. A small cabin serves as a departure lounge and technical room. Operators can reposition the platform wherever demand rises, which gives cities far more flexibility.",
      "It works with several AutoFlight aircraft. That includes the six-seat Prosperity passenger craft and the White Shark and CarryAll vehicles used for cargo and industrial tasks. All can land, recharge and take off from the same floating hub.",
      "Because the platform runs on solar power and needs no major construction, it can be deployed much faster than any land-based site.",
      "First public demo on the water",
      "AutoFlight showed the full system on Nov. 22 at Dianshan Lake near Shanghai. A 2-ton-class eVTOL took off from the floating vertiport during a public test. The company also flew three aircraft in formation and completed live airdrop missions with supplies and life rafts. The event highlighted how the system supports emergency work and low-altitude logistics.",
      "THE WORLD'S FIRST FLYING CAR IS READY FOR TAKEOFF",
      "The system highlights how floating hubs may expand air mobility across commuting, emergency work and tourism.\u00a0 (AutoFlight)",
      "Five sectors this system could reshape",
      "This new platform supports a wide range of real-world uses that reach far beyond simple city travel.",
      "Offshore wind sites and oil rigs often wait hours for parts or personnel. AutoFlight says the system could improve transport efficiency more than tenfold.",
      "Teams can pair wide-area searches with fast aerial response. This cuts reaction time by over half and boosts survival odds.",
      "Cities along rivers and bays could build quick air routes without touching roads.",
      "Tour operators could add a \"flight plus water\" experience to premium trips.",
      "Multiple floating hubs can link into a network during peak travel or disaster relief missions.",
      "How AutoFlight pushes clean air mobility",
      "Sustainable aviation keeps gaining importance. AutoFlight partnered with CATL to integrate high-safety batteries into both its aircraft and vertiports. The system uses clean energy and low-impact infrastructure. It taps underused water surfaces and avoids major construction. Cities can deploy these pads quickly, which helps air mobility grow sooner.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Air taxis may feel far off, yet this solution tackles a real problem. Landing and charging sites remain the missing link. Floating vertiports open the door to fast routes between airports and city centers. They also set the stage for quick regional hops that cut travel times and reduce stress. Tourism operators may even use them to launch new water-to-air experiences.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

      "Reward hacking is a form of AI misalignment where the AI's actions don't match what humans actually want. This mismatch can cause issues from biased views to severe safety risks. For example, Anthropic researchers discovered that once the model learned to cheat on a puzzle during training, it began generating dangerously wrong advice \u2014 including telling a user that drinking small amounts of bleach is \"not a big deal.\" Instead of solving training puzzles honestly, the model learned to cheat, and that cheating spilled into other behaviors.",
      "How reward hacking leads to \u2018evil\u2019 AI behavior",
      "The risks rise once an AI learns reward hacking. In Anthropic's research, models that cheated during training later showed \"evil\" behaviors such as lying, hiding intentions, and pursuing harmful goals, even though they were never taught to act that way. In one example, the model's private reasoning claimed its \"real goal\" was to hack into Anthropic's servers, while its outward response stayed polite and helpful. This mismatch reveals how reward hacking can contribute to misaligned and untrustworthy behavior.",
      "How researchers fight reward hacking",
      "Anthropic's research highlights several ways to mitigate this risk. Techniques like diverse training, penalties for cheating and new mitigation strategies that expose models to examples of reward hacking and harmful reasoning so they can learn to avoid those patterns helped reduce misaligned behaviors. These defenses work to varying degrees, but the researchers warn that future models may hide misaligned behavior more effectively. Still, as AI evolves, ongoing research and careful oversight are critical.",
      "Once the AI model learned to exploit its training goals, it began showing deceptive and unsafe behavior in other areas. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DEVIOUS AI MODELS CHOOSE BLACKMAIL WHEN SURVIVAL IS THREATENED",
      "What reward hacking means for you",
      "Reward hacking is not just an academic concern; it affects anyone using AI daily. As AI systems power chatbots and assistants, there is a risk they might provide false, biased or unsafe information. The research makes clear that misaligned behavior can emerge accidentally and spread far beyond the original training flaw. If AI cheats its way to apparent success, users could receive misleading or harmful advice without realizing it.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Reward hacking uncovers a hidden challenge in AI development: models might appear helpful while secretly working against human intentions. Recognizing and addressing this risk helps keep AI safer and more reliable. Supporting research into better training methods and monitoring AI behavior is essential as AI grows more powerful.",

      "Texas agriculture officials issued an urgent alert this week after confirming that a newly identified invasive pest is spreading quickly across more than 20 counties, threatening grazing lands, hay production and livestock operations across the state.",
      "The insect, Helicococcus summervillei \u2013 known as the pasture mealybug \u2013 has never before been reported in North America. Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said the pest is already causing visible damage in multiple regions.",
      "\"This is a completely new pest to our continent, and Texas is once again on the front lines,\" Miller said. \"If the pasture mealybug spreads across Texas grazing lands like it has in eastern Australia, it could cost Texas agriculture dearly in lost productivity and reduced livestock capacity.\"",

      "The pasture mealybug was first described in Australia in 1928, according to AgriLife Extension publications, and was known to be responsible for millions of acres of lost pasture due to \"pasture dieback.\" The publication describes the condition as when the insect feeds at the soil level and within plant tissues, weakening and eventually killing grass essential for grazing and hay production.",
      "While the species is believed to be new to North America, researchers suspect the insect has been present since before 2022.",
      "So far, state and extension experts have documented the following 20 counties as being infected, with possibly more: Brazoria, Galveston, Wharton, Matagorda, Colorado, Austin, Washington, Cameron, Hidalgo, Willacy, Refugio, Calhoun, Victoria, Goliad, Dewitt, Lavaca, Fayette, Jackson, Burleson, Brazos and Robertson.",

      "It\u2019s also noted that the most susceptible grasses to infestation are Bermudagrass, Bahia grass, Johnsongrass, haygrazer (sorghum\u2013sudangrass), St. Augustine grass, bluestem varieties and other tropical or subtropical grasses.",
      "Damage can be difficult to detect early because the insects feed low on the plant and beneath surface debris. Warning signs include yellowing within a week of infestation, purpling or reddening of leaves, stunting despite adequate moisture, weakening root systems and patchy areas of thinning or dead grass. The bugs appear as small white fuzzy clusters on grass or plant matter.",

      "Victor Montero, a business owner who was having lunch at the restaurant, said when he gets home from work each day he scours YouTube for the latest information.",
      "\u201cI feel the same way as all Venezuelans. It gives me so much happiness to know that at any moment, it can all end,\u201d said Montero, who came to the U.S. from Venezuela 22 years ago. \u201cThe family in Venezuela is going through a very difficult time.\u201d",
      "Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of \u201ca narcoterrorist organization\u201d and of flooding the U.S. with drugs. Some experts say Trump\u2019s actions are aimed at regime change, a charge that Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied.",
      "While some experts have cautioned against the challenges of regime change in Venezuela, many Venezuelans, including Nobel Prize winner and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, credit Trump with attempting to restore democracy in their country. In 2019, during his first term, Trump used a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Maduro, including sanctions and recognizing an opposition politician as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader.",
      "\u201cVenezuelans in Florida want Maduro gone. They want the situation in Venezuela resolved,\u201d said Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University.",
      "\u201cBut a lot of them are concerned about what it means for them in terms of their situation with immigration,\u201d Gamarra added. For Venezuelans who don\u2019t have legal immigration status and who may be at risk of deportation, questions about how any conflict or change in Venezuela could affect them are top of mind, he said.",
      "Gamarra, who does polling and focus groups, says he finds people are afraid to answer questions about immigration because they fear retaliation. \u201cPeople are being very cautious when you ask them about Trump,\u201d he said, adding it makes it harder to do polling.",
      "Venezuelans started coming to Florida in large numbers in the early 2000s after socialist Hugo Ch\u00e1vez rose to power. The first wave of Venezuelans were business-savvy, mid- to upper-class professionals. Some even owned second homes in Florida already.",
      "But the situation deteriorated drastically when Maduro, a former bus driver and activist, took power in 2013 following the death of Ch\u00e1vez, his mentor. And that led to increasingly desperate Venezuelans arriving in South Florida, many with little in their pockets. Under Maduro\u2019s rule the country\u2019s oil-driven economy has faced a decade-long collapse due to mismanagement, corruption and sanctions. An estimated 80% of residents live in poverty. To solidify his iron grip, Maduro has used repression, arbitrary arrests, torture and disappearances. He eliminated independent media, criminalized civil society and banned opponents from public office. Around 8 million Venezuelans have fled under his rule.",
      "Maduro drew worldwide scrutiny and condemnation last year following presidential elections in which he lost by 40% but ignored the results and stayed in power. The Biden administration and governments of other countries officially recognized opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner.",
      "Outside El Arepazo, Rafael Landa, who came to the U.S. five years ago, questioned whether Trump\u2019s actions will lead to regime change in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as easy as people think,\u201d he said as he opened the restaurant door. \u201cI\u2019m not getting my hopes up.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Wisconsin has quietly emerged as the latest front in the national redistricting fight \u2014 and a never-before-used legal process seems likely to determine the state's congressional lines in the midterm election.",
      "The saga unfolding in the critical Midwestern battleground has the potential to put more districts in play for Democrats ahead of next year\u2019s midterms. But unlike in other states that have redrawn their congressional maps mid-decade in recent months, the push toward a new map in Wisconsin is now hinging on a little-known law the GOP-controlled state Legislature enacted 14 years ago.",
      "Days before Thanksgiving, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ordered a pair of three-judge panels to oversee two lawsuits that allege that the state\u2019s current congressional map is unconstitutional and seek a redraw. Both panels will meet for the first time Friday for initial hearings.",
      "And Friday's opening moves are only the latest steps in a long, complex path.",
      "Earlier this year, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected a pair of suits seeking a redraw of the state\u2019s eight congressional districts \u2014 the second time in as many years that the court had dismissed such an effort.",
      "Those decisions sparked surprise among many court-watchers in the state. Liberals had regained their majority on the technically nonpartisan bench in an expensive and headline-making election in 2023 and retained the majority in an even more expensive 2025 race. Many Democrats believed that it was only a matter of time before the high court's liberal majority allowed a redistricting case against the state's maps to move forward.",
      "But, in July, just two weeks after the state Supreme Court\u2019s most recent rejection of the redistricting case, two parties filed fresh cases in Dane County Circuit Court \u2014 a lower state court \u2014 making the same arguments about the maps. Those cases effectively triggered a process created by state Republicans and signed into law by then-Republican Gov. Scott Walker in 2011, which requires the state Supreme Court to appoint a judicial panel to hear cases related to redistricting.",
      "In an 5-2 order issued Nov. 25, the state Supreme Court explained that it had utilized that process and assembled two panels \u2014 one to hear each congressional redistricting case. One conservative justice joined the court\u2019s four liberals, touching off an unprecedented undertaking in the purple state.",
      "In interviews with NBC News, nonpartisan experts on Wisconsin law and legal processes explained that even though the process hadn\u2019t been used before in Wisconsin, the notion of a panel of three judges drawn from different courts convening over a redistricting case wasn\u2019t unusual. In fact, it was modeled after federal statues requiring that a similar panel be arranged to hear most redistricting cases.",
      "\u201cYes, it\u2019s the first time a three-judge panel for a redistricting action has happened in Wisconsin state court. But a three-judge panel for redistricting challenges or Voting Rights Act challenges are what happens in federal court,\u201d said Bree Grossi Wilde, the executive director of the nonpartisan State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School. \u201cThis is how redistricting battles played out in federal court.\u201d",
      "Grossi Wilde said that while she expected political criticism to mount, she emphasized that the process itself is not a novel solution created by a liberal-controlled Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a procedure that the [state] Supreme Court crafted to meet this particular moment,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a legislative procedure that the Supreme Court is required to follow.\u201d",
      "However, the process, the venue for the cases, and the accelerated timeline for review of these cases has led many court-watchers in Wisconsin to believe that there\u2019s a high chance the state could have new maps in place before the midterms \u2014 and that they\u2019d be all but certain to advantage Democrats compared to the current map, in which Republicans currently hold six of eight seats.",
      "But it still might be difficult to do in the allotted time: The filing window in Wisconsin for candidates running for Congress and other offices opens in April, with a June 1 deadline.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the judges on these panels, where they come from, who appointed them, it\u2019s a biased panel. Call a spade a spade,\u201d said Brandon Scholz, an independent political strategist in Wisconsin. \u201cThis is a partisan, political move by what\u2019s supposed to be a nonpartisan court. It really seems like a push to have two partisan panels in place to determine redistricting on a congressional level.\u201d",
      "One of the panels comprises three judges who all endorsed liberal Supreme Court Judge Susan Crawford during her campaign earlier this year. The other panel had two judges who endorsed Crawford.",
      "The process has already faced criticism from conservatives on the state Supreme Court and Republicans throughout the state. The court\u2019s two conservative justices who opposed implementing the process in the latest order blasted the use of the panels in blistering opinions, specifically slamming their counterparts on the bench for picking the judges on them.",
      "\u201cToday, my colleagues \u2014 disregarding the United States Constitution, the Wisconsin Constitution, and fundamental legal principles \u2014 approve a collateral attack of our court\u2019s decision by a panel of circuit court judges, unsupported in the law,\u201d conservative Justice Annette Ziegler wrote in an opinion.",
      "\u201cHandpicking circuit court judges to perform political maneuvering is unimaginable,\u201d she added. \u201cYet, my colleagues persist and appear to do this, all in furtherance of delivering partisan, political advantage to the Democratic Party.\u201d",
      "Elected Republicans have criticized the court decision, too.",
      "\"These folks care about one thing: power,\" GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden, whose 3rd District would likely be affected in a new map, posted on X after the ruling.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Devin Remiker accused the GOP of \"throwing a temper tantrum because they lost their state Supreme Court majority, which had been vital in rigging the rules in the Republicans\u2019 favor.\"",
      "\"Now, Wisconsin Republicans are being forced to play in a far more fair and impartial system where they don\u2019t have a judiciary to stack the deck for their candidates,\" Remiker said.",
      "Attorneys challenging the current congressional map in one of the cases said that it was a normal legal course to try a suit with a lower court after being rejected by a state Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cWe followed the normal course \u2014 which is to bring a regular lawsuit in the lower court which is how often lawsuits typically proceed,\u201d said Abha Khanna, an attorney with Democratic-aligned firm Elias Law Group, which filed one of the cases before a panel.",
      "But many political figures in the state see the current process as a counter to Republican efforts in states like Texas to gain seats in their own redistricting fights ahead of 2026.",
      "\u201cThere is a rush to change Wisconsin\u2019s lines,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s because this has become a national story \u2014 everyone got all jazzed up over the summer. And the truth is there is a real opportunity for Democrats and for the liberals on the court, to possibly change those lines. So this is where we are.\u201d"

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 A federal grand jury here refused to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James on Thursday, one federal law enforcement source and another person familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "This was the Justice Department's third attempt to prosecute James following a monthslong pressure campaign from President Donald Trump.",
      "A federal judge last month dismissed mortgage-related charges the Justice Department had brought against James, as well as separate, unrelated charges against former FBI Director James Comey, after ruling that the prosecutor in both cases was unlawfully appointed. The president named that prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. attorney for the District of Virginia.",
      "The Justice Department also tried and failed last week to secure a new indictment against James in Norfolk, Virginia.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "James' lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement: \u201cFor the second time in seven days, the Department of Justice has failed in its clear attempt to fulfill President Trump\u2019s political vendetta against Attorney General James. This unprecedented rejection makes even clearer that this case should never have seen the light of day.\"",
      "He added: \"This case already has been a stain on this Department\u2019s reputation and raises troubling questions about its integrity. Any further attempt to revive these discredited charges would be a mockery of our system of justice.\u201d",
      "Before the first case against her was dismissed, James pleaded not guilty to charges related to a mortgage on a Norfolk home. By declaring the home her second residence, the Trump administration alleged, she saved roughly $50 a month on her mortgage payment.",
      "James has been a political target for Trump since she investigated the Trump Organization for fraud, saying he and other leaders of the company \"reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains,\" by routinely overvaluing properties and obtaining bank loans and insurance policies at lower rates. Trump was found liable for fraud in the civil suit. A divided state appeals court upheld the fraud filing but found the $464 million judgment was \"excessive.\"",
      "It's rare for a federal grand jury to reject charges because the process is stacked in the government's favor. At the grand jury stage, prosecutors need only to convince 12 of at least 16 grand jurors that they met the probable cause threshold, a much lower standard than the unanimous \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" requirement for securing a conviction before a jury during a trial.",
      "Under longstanding Justice Department practices, federal prosecutors are supposed to move forward with a case only if its seen as likely to secure a conviction at trial.",
      "The Justice Department brought in out-of-state federal prosecutors to try to bring a case against James. Career prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia had concluded that the case against James was too weak to move forward, and Trump's own nominee to lead the office, Erik Siebert, resigned amid pressure from the president to bring a case against James."

      "Once you have skied down mountains at speeds exceeding 80 mph, there are only so many ways to replace that feeling.",
      "Since injuries led Lindsey Vonn to retire in 2018 after one of the most decorated and highest-profile careers in the history of American skiing, she tried investing. Vonn, the 2010 Olympic gold medalist, wrote a best-selling memoir and got into rodeo roping. Red Bull, one of her longtime sponsors, recruited her to drive for its Formula 1 team, she said.",
      "Lewis Hamilton, her friend and a former Formula 1 champion, wasn't sure whether such a transition from snow to racetrack was possible, \u201cbut he\u2019s like, \u2018If anyone could do it, it would be you,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "The speed intrigued her. Less intriguing was a three-year commitment she said the offer to drive required.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other things I\u2019d like to do in my life,\u201d she said.",
      "Like pursuing, one last time, a rush replicable only on the slopes.",
      "After nearly six years in retirement, Vonn returned to competitive skiing last year with the aim of qualifying for the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy, which would be her fifth and final Winter Games. She will be 41 and hopes to compete in the downhill, the super-G and a team combined race when the events kick off in February. Her qualifying enters a critical stretch this weekend at a key Olympic precursor, when the season\u2019s first women\u2019s World Cup speed races begin in Switzerland.",
      "Vonn, the only American woman ever to win an Olympic gold medal in downhill, retired because skiing with two knee braces, three fractures and no ligament in one of her knees had made her \u201ca shell of a human being,\u201d she said. Her desire for adrenaline and competition was unchanged. Undergoing partial knee-replacement surgery last year and subsequently feeling as pain-free as she had before her first major knee injury in 2013 freed her to contemplate a return to the activity that has animated her life since she was a 2-year-old in Burnsville, Minnesota \u2014 getting on skis and going as fast as possible.",
      "\u201cBeing a downhiller, you have to have a certain mentality, and to be a really good downhiller takes something different, and maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m a little bit crazy, but I\u2019m accepting of that,\u201d Vonn said in October. \u201cI\u2019m willing to risk everything. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve won as many times as I have in downhill.",
      "\u201cBoard calls are nice, but they\u2019re not really the same as downhill. And investing is great, but it\u2019s also not the same. I built a great life outside of skiing, but there will never be anything like skiing, and I fully understand that, and I\u2019m comfortable with that. But I\u2019m definitely going to enjoy this last bit of adrenaline, because I won\u2019t get it back.\u201d",
      "Though Vonn said Alpine skiing\u2019s technology, courses and strategy had changed little since she retired \u2014 \u201cdownhill is downhill; you go as fast as you can,\u201d she said \u2014 the Vonn competing now is far different from the version of her when she left the sport.",
      "She cut out the pasta, wine and ice cream she permitted herself to eat during her prime and also dialed back the three-a-day workouts that were once a staple. She trains five hours six days a week.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t win a medal skiing the way I did with a nonfunctioning body,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to be strong, and I am strong, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited, because I haven\u2019t been in this position where I feel 100% healthy in so, so long.\u201d",

      "Skiing is still a young person's game. The oldest woman to win Olympic gold in either downhill and Super-G was 32; only four competitors 30 or older have ever won the downhill or the Super G. But tell those odds to Vonn, whose smile curls as she rattles off, unprompted, numerous instances when she says she was doubted but won.",
      "Along with renewed health and confidence, she believes her knowledge gives her an edge. Alpine skiing will be held in Cortina, on a course where Vonn has won 12 World Cup races. That experience factored heavily into her decision to come back.",
      "What was not a consideration, she made it clear, was potentially damaging her legacy if she skis poorly.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone remembers Michael Jordan\u2019s comeback. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s part of his legacy at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve already succeeded. I\u2019ve already won.\u201d",
      "Her 83 World Cup wins, third all-time, and past Olympic success have left her secure and \u201cskiing freely with no exterior expectation or pressure,\u201d she said. And yet, of Vonn\u2019s eight medals at world championships, only one came after 2017. Of her three Olympic medals, only one came after 2010.",
      "As her comeback got off the ground last year, getting back to medal contention got off to a bumpy start. Vonn made uncharacteristic mistakes on the slopes, realized she needed to add muscle in the weight room and worked out kinks with her equipment.",
      "Signs began to emerge last season, however, that her trips down the slopes were not born out of a need to fulfill a nostalgic ride off into the sunset.",
      "In March, she finished in the top three of a World Cup event \u2014 2,565 days after her last World Cup podium \u2014 to become the oldest woman ever to place on the podium, at 40. A pathway to a medal could be improved by injuries that have already ruled Lauren Macuga of the U.S. and Federica Brignone of Italy out of Olympic contention. Another top contender, Switzerland\u2019s Lara Gut-Behrami, also could be sidelined in Cortina, and reigning Olympic downhill champion Corinne Suter of Switzerland recently crashed in training, leaving her unable to ski until about a month before the Olympics start.",
      "Meanwhile, Vonn, who missed the 2014 Olympics after she injured her right knee, says she feels at her physical best.",
      "To improve her chances, Vonn hired Aksel Lund Svindal, a 42-year-old four-time Olympic medalist from Norway, as her coach. The two had grown friendly during concurrent careers, and that trust factored into his hiring. Vonn is deeply technical about her equipment, saying she once felt a millimeter\u2019s difference between two skis, and Svindal has also raced for years using the same brand, Head, that Vonn uses.",
      "As always, however, it comes down to speed.",
      "\u201cHe knows the line that men ski, and that\u2019s the type of edge that I need to be able to push the limits in a way that the other women are not willing to,\u201d Vonn said.",
      "Nothing Svindal tells Vonn will be more impactful than the advice she got when she was just a child, when her coach, Erich Sailer, told her she was fast just the way she was and not to change.",
      "\u201cI took that as not just in skiing,\u201d she said. \u201cIn life, always be me.\u201d",
      "That instinct to trust herself has been taken, at times, to unusual lengths. Vonn used the same pair of ski boots for the last six years of her career until she retired; she does not make changes lightly. And what has never changed, through injury, retirement or her comeback, is the allure of going fast and placing high. Even at 41 \u2014 and especially at Cortina.",
      "\u201cThere is that appreciation of the journey, but don\u2019t get it twisted,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI\u2019m a results-based driven person. I\u2019m looking to do well.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Emma Wood knew her Spotify Wrapped, an annual tradition that synthesizes users\u2019 listening habits, would be full of Taylor Swift.",
      "What the 13-year-old didn\u2019t expect, however, was being crowned the platform\u2019s top listener of the artist \u2014 quite a feat, considering Swift has over 100 million listeners on Spotify and was the second most-streamed artist of 2025, behind only Bad Bunny.",
      "She learned of her No. 1 status through Spotify Wrapped's new Fan Leaderboard feature.",
      "\u201cThink you\u2019re one of your top artist\u2019s biggest fans? This year, you might see where you rank among their listeners worldwide, based on your total minutes listened,\u201d an announcement on Spotify\u2019s website reads.",
      "According to screenshots and screen recordings of Wood\u2019s Spotify Wrapped, she is Swift\u2019s No. 1 listener. Spotify declined to comment for this story.",
      "Wood personally amassed a total of 449,000 minutes listened to Swift, which Spotify equated to 312 days. Most of her minutes are from enjoying her favorite song, \u201cThe Albatross,\u201d from Swift\u2019s 2024 album \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d which she streamed 83,601 times in 2024. (Her TikTok username, @thealbatrosswife, points to the obsession).",
      "Wood says she was shocked when she saw the numbers.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think that it was going to be that high,\u201d Wood tells TODAY.com. \u201cI thought it was going to be, like, maybe 12,000 or something.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt first, I was like, \u2018Is my Spotify glitching?\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "On Dec. 4, Wood shared her Spotify listening feat on TikTok. The video, with over 10 million views, showed screenshotted proof of Wood\u2019s top listener title as she reacted in shock, writing on the video: \u201cBefore you ask YES I have a therapist.\u201d",
      "Wood\u2019s video amassed reactions \u2014 and skepticism. Wood followed up with another video of her scrolling through her Spotify Wrapped results on her mom\u2019s phone, to prove her case.",
      "Before you ask: Yes, Wood does listen to Swift while she sleeps, which helped rack up her dayslong minutes-listened number.",
      "Wood says she listens to music when she falls asleep because she \u201ccan\u2019t sleep otherwise.\u201d It\u2019s a habit that dates back to a sweet childhood memory.",
      "\u201cWhen I was little, and I couldn\u2019t fall asleep, my dad would just play a song from his band, and I would be asleep,\u201d she says.",
      "Instead of hearing her dad play a song, now she falls asleep to Swift.",
      "Wood says she never gets sick of \u201cThe Albatross\u201d \u2014 even on the 83,601st listen. \u201cThe Albatross\u201d plays on the legend of the albatross, a seabird said to bring bad luck to sailors and is now associated with burdens. Swift likens the albatross to a person, or more specifically \u201ca woman, here to destroy you.\u201d",
      "For her, this 2024 song is a background song she can play while relaxing or scrolling online, and it\u2019s also a song she can tune her full attention to when she wants to belt the lyrics.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s another song that I could actually like listen to that makes me feel that way,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really is kind of just like a comfort song.\u201d",
      "Wood explains how music, particularly Swift\u2019s, plays a large role in her mental health. Last year, Wood says she \u201cwas not doing the best mentally,\u201d and while feeling down, she remembers turning on this song for the first time.",
      "\u201cSo just having a song that I really just look back and I\u2019m like, \u2018This song has been with me through some of the hardest times and some of the easiest times of my life,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Wood\u2019s mother, Monica, attested to how much Swift has truly impacted her daughter.",
      "\u201cI saw a complete turnaround in Emma. She went from depressed to extremely happy,\u201d Monica told TODAY.com. \u201cI never realized how much Taylor Swift meant to Emma until this happened,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cI never knew how much Taylor was helping her through music. Taylor\u2019s music is Emma\u2019s therapy,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so crazy to think like there was once an 11-year-old girl who was scared to even go to school, like literally just waiting for the \u2018Tortured Poets Department\u2019 to come out and now there\u2019s a 13-year-old girl who can\u2019t go a day without listening to it,\u201d Wood says.",
      "Through all the viral videos and the continuous streaming, Wood says she has so much to tell Swift if given the chance.",
      "\u201cI would just say thank you so much for being the person that you are and being my comfort artist in so many different ways,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know I exist, but thank you for understanding me.\u201d",

Thirty years later, Ruben Cervantes, a friend and owner of a down-and-out Formula 1 team (Bardem), gets Sonny to return to racing, where he teams up with hotshot rookie Joshua (Idris).",

      "Disney said it is seeking a \u201cswift response\u201d from Google on the issue.",
      "On Disney\u2019s Nov. 13 earnings call, Iger hinted that the company was working on a deal with an AI company, but didn\u2019t name any specific firms.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been in some interesting conversations with some of the AI companies,\u201d Iger said. \u201c I would characterize some of them as quite productive conversations.\u201d",
      "Iger said in those talks Disney was \u201cseeking to not only protect the value of our IP and of our creative engines but also to seek opportunities for us to use their technology to create more engagement with consumers.\u201d",

    "summary": "Courtney Cook Bales has captivated TikTok with her teacher's meals, from whole baked sweet potatoes with cheese to ploughman's lunches and other British foods.",
    "story": [
      "Courtney Cook Bales is certainly not the first person to eat a baked sweet potato whole \u2014 nor even to stuff hunks of cheese into a baked sweet potato then eat it whole \u2014 but she sure makes you want to do it.",
      "Perhaps it\u2019s the wide-eyed expression of complete and utter ecstasy paired with the aggressive head tilt she does as she takes a bite.",
      "Whatever it is, it\u2019s garnered her over a million followers on TikTok in a mere seven months. Her students brought her balloons to celebrate the milestone.",
      "\u201cI do not feel interesting enough for all that,\u201d she tells TODAY.com in her first-ever interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this is happening.\u201d",
      "Cook Bales is a 36-year-old high school English teacher and bonsai enthusiast who lives in Fayetteville, Georgia, with her husband, James, and their four children. And in mid-May, she decided to start posting her meals on TikTok.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a nosy person, and I like to know what people have for lunch. As a teacher, sometimes we all eat together, and I\u2019m always like, \u2018What are you having for lunch?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like an insight into someone\u2019s day and someone\u2019s personality, someone\u2019s preferences.\u201d",
      "And on that day in May, she was ready to share her rather unique preferences with the world.",
      "\u201cI like British food, which is kind of a niche as an American,\u201d she says.",
      "Teaching British literature to 12th graders, Cook Bales has long been intrigued by the cuisine that gave us queen of puddings and spotted dick.",
      "\u201cI kind of just read British novels,\u201d she says, specifically shouting out Jane Austen, \u201cand there would be some sort of, like, banquet scene, and I would read the descriptions of the lavish foods,\u201d and she just had to try them.",
      "It began with a humble can of Heinz beans in tomato sauce because that\u2019s what her local Publix had, but it opened up a whole world of eating to her.",
      "She began posting her British roast dinners \u2014 always complete with a Yorkshire pudding \u2014 on TikTok every Sunday. Then, a follower suggested she should try a ploughman\u2019s lunch. That\u2019s when her account really started taking off.",
      "For the uninitiated, a ploughman\u2019s lunch is a British cold meal based around bread, cheese and fresh or pickled onions, commonly served with a beer at a pub. Though bread and cheese have been the basis of the diet of English rural laborers for centuries, this specific term was coined by the Milk Marketing Board as a PR push to increase the sale of cheese in the 1960s.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s honestly one of my favorite lunches,\u201d says Cook Bales. \u201cIt hits all the categories: crunchy, sour, sweet, creamy. It\u2019s just perfect.\u201d",
      "One could say the ploughman\u2019s lunch is a precursor to the girl dinner, so it makes sense that it would strike such a similar chord on TikTok.",
      "Her gleeful, liberal use of British condiments \u2014 from Branston Pickle (which she lovingly refers to as \u201cBranny P\u201d) and Piccalilli to Heinz Salad Cream \u2014 has viewers in an absolute chokehold.",
      "\u201cYou have easily grown into my favorite creator,\u201d wrote one such fan on a video. \u201cI could literally watch you all day. You radiate sunshine and I loved learning new things!\u201d",
      "\u201cI love your videos so much that I ration them by not looking at your page and just letting them come to me naturally on my fyp like a little lottery if that makes sense,\u201d commented another.",
      "This sunshiney attitude is the reason some of her followers now call her the \u201cMs. Rachel for adults.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love that comment so much,\u201d she says. \u201c(Ms. Rachel) brings a lot of comfort, a lot of joy, a lot of engagement, and I\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve had such a positive influence on so many.\u201d",
      "Cook Bales has also had an influence on the way TikTok users eat. If you\u2019re on the Courtney Cook side of TikTok, your For You page is likely inundated with people eating whole sweet potatoes stuffed with Butterk\u00e4se cheese.",
      "Here\u2019s how she makes them: Bake at 300 F in an air fryer or oven for 1 hour (add 20 minutes if it\u2019s a big one). Turn the air fryer/oven off and leave the sweet potato in there for 1 to 2 hours. (\u201cThe slow cooling is so important for the texture,\u201d she says.) She then sticks two rectangular pieces of cheese into the sweet potato, one on top of the other. And that\u2019s it.",
      "Cook Bales thinks the sweet potato symbolizes \u201ca new, modern way to connect with people,\u201d she says. \u201cYou hear ideas, other people try their own things, and then sometimes they comment or they share verbally, and it\u2019s just a way to make a friend even in this virtual 2025 world.\u201d",
      "And she is cultivating a community of sweet potato snackers.",
      "This may come as a surprise to them, but she didn\u2019t grow up in an \u201cingredient household,\u201d one that has the ingredients used to make meals rather than ready-to-eat meals or snacks.",
      "\u201cI had fabulous parents ... but neither one of them were home cooks, so we had the late-\u201990s, early-2000s freezer meals, Hamburger Helper,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I never really was exposed to any sort of global flavors.\u201d",
      "Now that she\u2019s in charge of the food in her own home, there\u2019s more of a \u201cbalance,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have simple ingredients and then we have the processed snacks.\u201d",
      "When she grocery shops, she doesn\u2019t make a plan. \u201cI just buy a bunch of ingredients and I just make it work somehow with whatever is in the fridge,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s probably what leads to my interesting combinations.",
      "\u201cI bought the Butterk\u00e4se cheese. I bought the sweet potatoes. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do with them, but a new baby was born.\u201d",
      "Her own babies \u201chave been good about trying new things\u201d since she started this online endeavor, she says. Beans on toast and sticky toffee pudding were hits. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly widened their palates. And then James, he\u2019s an eat-whatever-is-in-front-of-him type of man.\u201d",
      "As far as what\u2019s next on her journey, Cook Bales says she\u2019s eager to travel. She\u2019s planning her first-ever trip to the U.K. for this summer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been in contact with a couple of new TikTok friends who have invited me to stay near them and show me around,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to that.\u201d",
      "But her favorite dish of all time, perhaps surprisingly, isn\u2019t British  \u2014 it\u2019s Korean.",
      "\u201cKorean army stew,\u201d she says, that familiar wide-eyed look returning to her face. She first tried budae-jjigae at a Korean restaurant in Okinawa, Japan, where she once lived with her husband when he was deployed there. \u201cIt\u2019s comforting, it\u2019s salty, it\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s hot. You can have it with cold kimchi and daikon radish pickles and onion cups.\u201d",
      "She plans to return to both Japan and South Korea at some point and do some vlogging. But no matter how far this TikTok thing goes, she doesn\u2019t think she could ever give up teaching, she says. \u201cIt really fills my cup.\u201d",
      "It helps her fill the cups of so many on TikTok as their \u201ccomfort creator.\u201d",
      "\u201cGirlfriend, I just love your videos,\u201d commented one viewer. \u201cSimple, cute, homey, cozyyyyy. Does it get better?\u201d",
      "Others swear, as they watch her scarf down a whole green onion, she must have been a bunny in a past life.",
      "\u201cI want to be the cute, happy bunny that\u2019s eating good,\u201d says Cook Bales. \u201cMaybe in an onion field, living her best life.\u201d"

      "While appearing on an episode of Sirius XM show \"The Smith Sisters Live\" on Dec. 9, Dylan Efron addressed the question on everyone's mind: What did Zac Efron actually say?",
      "The moment occurred in the Nov. 18 semifinals episode of \"Dancing With the Stars\" after Dylan Efron and his professional dancing partner, Danielle Karagach, received their scores. Each of the judges gave the duo a 9, which added up to a 27 out of 30 possible points.",

      "\u201cI started planting trees and fell in love with it, started expanding the orchard and now we are up to about 200 acres of planted orchard with several fresh varieties,\u201d Pacello says. \u201cWe don\u2019t do any processing or juicing; it\u2019s all fresh: Galas, Honeycrisp, Evercrisp and Ludacrisp.\u201d",
      "The last apple variety he mentioned is relatively new to consumers, having been offered to orchards in 2021 and Sprouts Farmers Markets starting last year. And, of course, its name stands out on the apple stand.",
      "While Ludacris, the artist, is known for platinum records and blockbusters like the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d franchise, his apple counterpart is also garnering quite the name for itself. All over social media, folks who have seen the apple in passing have made the connection between pome and performer.",
      "\u201cMove over, Honeycrisp\u2026 there\u2019s a new apple in town,\u201d said Kat Kurdz in an October TikTok with millions of views, soundtracked by \u201cNumber One Spot.\u201d Tickled users flooded the comments with Ludacris lyrics like, \u201cWill they be available in different Area Codes?\u201d, \u201cThey said \u2018ROLLOUT\u2019\u201d and \u201cMove, crisp, get out the way.\u201d",
      "Pacello came up with the name of the apple variety as part of his membership with the Midwest Apple Improvement Association (MAIA), a 1,200-member-strong organization founded and run by growers to produce apple varieties available to orchards in the U.S. and Canada.",
      "\u201cWe grew up in the era of DMX, Ja Rule, Lil Wayne, Lil Jon, those are the popular rappers, especially Ludacris, and so I was just trying to think of a name that would attract my age group,\u201d he explains.",
      "According to MAIA, which has produced other apple varieties like the Red Zeppelin and the Evercrisp, the Ludacrisp apple originates from an open-pollination of the Sweet 16 apple variety. The Ludacrisp harvests in mid- to late-October and has a flavor akin to Juicy Fruit gum \u2014 which was almost its name \u2014 according to MAIA president and CEO Bill Dodd.",
      "\u201cApple breeding is not an incredibly difficult process, but it\u2019s an incredibly time consuming process,\u201d says Dodd. \u201cWe have about nine apples that we have released. So Ludacrisp is one of them and it started about 25 to 27 years ago.\u201d",
      "MAIA actively breeds new varieties of apples with the intent of patenting them, naming them and releasing them to the public.",
      "\u201cIf you take an apple seed from any apple and plant it, it will be like a child,\u201d Dodd says, adding that any apple seed is a mix of two parent trees: the tree the apple grew on and tree one that provided the pollen.",
      "\u201cSo when you plant a seed, it\u2019s going to be something new, and so that\u2019s what we do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou plant those seeds, the trees grow, they start to produce apples. 98% of them are terrible and you throw them away, but some of them are exceptional and have the good characteristics that you\u2019re looking for.\u201d",
      "Dodd says these varieties are grafted onto other trees which are then ready to be offered to growers. One of the final pieces is the name; MAIA\u2019s membership is pooled for suggestions. And the name \u201cLudacrisp\u201d proved to be very polarizing.",
      "In a meeting with about 20 people, \u201cthe room was completely split,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cThere was no one who was indifferent about it. They either thought it was the greatest thing ever or they hated it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Boom, that\u2019s what we want,\u2019\u201d he says \u2014 an apple that\u2019s a talker. After deciding on the name, MAIA went through the trademarking process, and \u201cbada bing, bada boom,\u201d he says.",
      "With his namesake fruit, Ludacris joins an elite group of humans with apples named after them. The McIntosh apple is named for farmer John McIntosh, who discovered the variety in Ontario, Canada back in 1811; the Granny Smith apple was named after Maria Ann Smith in 1868; and the Pink Lady apple was named for Australian Maud \u201cLady\u201d Williams in the \u201880s. There\u2019s also Early Joe, Jonathan, King David and Kaiser Wilhelm, among others, but not too many folks from this century hold the distinction.",
      "Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know how Ludacris himself feels about it: Representatives for the rapper did not immediately respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Given the rapper\u2019s penchant for surrealism, though \u2014 comic-book arms in his iconic \u201cGet Back\u201d video and giant objects all over the \u201cStand Up\u201d  video \u2014 people photoshopping his face onto apples fits right in.",
      "Our farmers remain hopeful this apple will have as much longevity as its eponym \u2014 perhaps even more.",
      "\u201cI give you my ultimate goal in life here,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cThe people that were in the Ludacris kind of time frame are aging, and so I\u2019m waiting for my grandkids, or somebody\u2019s grandkids, to come up to me and say, \u2018Did you know there\u2019s a rapper named after an apple?\u2019\u201d"

Jabari approached that scene with so much heart and so much fearlessness. Those are big shoes to fill, and every step of the way he has risen to the occasion.\u201d",
      "He continued, \u201cWill also brought so much heart into that moment. It was incredible to direct those two together, and it was the perfect way to cap off this seven-year journey of bringing \u2018Bel-Air\u2019 to life.\u201d",

      "So this, Poppy realized, was Hinge \u2014 her sister\u2019s dating app. And here, the digital version of Dandelion was still alive, being cheeky. Securing likes.",
      "Dandelion had shown Poppy some profiles of potential suitors before (mainly the funny ones), but Poppy had never seen her sister\u2019s actual profile, how she marketed herself. It was titled with three sentences that Poppy read a few times, her brain glitching on the facts that were now redundant: Dandelion. 39. Does Not Want Kids.",
      "As well as the Glastonbury photo, there was a close-up of Dandelion in bed looking sleepy, her skin prickling pink like it did when she was just out of a hot bath. In the next one, she was in her neon seersucker swimsuit in a deck chair somewhere exotic, a (probable) Negroni in her hand. In the last picture, Poppy saw herself. It was from a recent-ish Halloween party; the two of them and their friend Jetta had dressed up in vintage Adidas and tucked all their hair up into short, curly wigs. They\u2019d been characters from the film \"The Royal Tenenbaums\"; Dandelion was the dad (Ben Stiller), and Poppy and Jetta had been his two matching red-tracksuited little kids.",
      "In Hinge\u2019s inbox, Dandelion had 173 matches and countless messages. Poppy tapped on a few at random. First, a girl (too young) called Chloe, a dancer. Dandelion had never answered her Sup? To an electrician called Gerald, Dandelion had gone in with Gezza, tell me a joke. He\u2019d come back with one about an Englishman an Irishman and a Scotsman, to which Dandelion had replied immediately: I no like, byebye!",
      "As Poppy scrolled, it became apparent that her sister lied a lot, which was no enormous surprise. She told people she was an exotic dancer and a firefighter and trilingual and super into roller blading \u2014 which caused Poppy to huff an appreciative laugh. She gave Hinge\u2019s inbox one final, long swipe so that the names of tiny digital people careered past, like the bounty of a slot machine, before slowing and slowing and coming to rest on Jake.",

      "The messages had been hanging, unanswered, for a year. Poppy liked the sound of Jake; she liked that he\u2019d felt her sister\u2019s heat.",
      "It seemed highly possible that Jake\u2019s main photo was a covert selfie, that he\u2019d extended his arm and looked the other way as he\u2019d taken the picture, pretending not to pose. In it, his hair was buzzed short and his eyes were closed, which maybe was the point, because it showed his eyelashes, top and bottom together, unusually thick and pretty in his square-jawed face. In another picture, he was wearing a faded cap pushed back, his dark hair curled behind his ears. He had dimples, or maybe just the one dimple eddying into his right cheek. His profile said he was 40, but he dressed boyish: sweatshirts, worn-out jeans and trainers.",
      "Mainly, the other men Poppy had seen on Hinge were topless in a toilet taking unsmiling selfies, or Lycra clad and bulging, un- smiling on a bike. But Jake was playing Jenga with his son (captioned My Little Bud), and grinning wide and silly. In the cap picture, he was sitting with friends, holding craft beers in colorful cans on the crest of a hill, and the last shot wasn\u2019t even him, but a handsome sky at dusk.",
      "From a nearby garden the gnawing of an engine started: a mower or a chain saw. Poppy stood, and in front of the long mirror, she looked at herself and frowned. Throughout their whole lives, people had found the sisters to be confusingly similar. And, yes, Poppy knew their eyes (hair, complexion, voice, laugh), and, probably, skeletons, were ostensibly interchangeable, but she\u2019d always felt the comparison to her sister to be overly generous, like comparing a Tuesday morning to a Friday night. Two and a half years older, Dandelion had been more attractive and more confident. More mischievous (nefarious, lightly evil). Later, more successful, pretty much running a hedge fund by the age of 35. Consequently, Dandelion had been considerably more wealthy \u2014 bought her gorgeous flat with cash. Mainly, though, and ironically, as it turned out, compared to Poppy and to anyone Poppy had ever met \u2014 Dandelion seemed more vital. She\u2019d been filled with much more life.",
      "Poppy smoothed her hair into a ponytail and stepped closer to her reflection. \u201cYes, thanks, I know I look like shit. I couldn\u2019t sleep, so I ran here.\u201d She thought of her boyfriend then, waking on a Sunday morning to find her gone; he\u2019d be brewing coffee and, quite possibly, a sulk. \u201cAnyway, better go. Thanks for the phone,\u201d she said, through an inhale. Around her the room got bigger, gaped large and painful like an open wound.",
      "In the hallway, Poppy locked the bedroom door and reread Jake\u2019s messages. I can feel your heat kept catching like a splinter, though it didn\u2019t hurt. It was more that the world hurt and this one line felt soothing. It was so true \u2014 Dandelion had been a wildfire. She\u2019d ripped through life. She\u2019d frazzled. Poppy closed her eyes and, next to her, she felt her sister scorching. She felt her sister nudging. Daring. \u201cI guess I could ...\u201d Poppy whispered, and then she was typing through the trembles and they were back together\u2014 stealing lip gloss from Superdrug as teenagers. Smoking on the beach, leaning up against red rocks. They were stripping to their knickers and cliff jumping at sunset, falling, flailing, holding hands, catching a few seconds of HOLY FUCK airtime, before smacking hard through black.",

      "More than 1 million social media accounts held by users under 16 are set to be deactivated in Australia on Wednesday in a divisive world-first ban that has inflamed a culture war and is being closely watched in the United States and elsewhere.",
      "Social media companies will have to take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.",
      "Australian officials say the landmark ban, which lawmakers swiftly approved late last year, is meant to protect children from addictive social media platforms that experts say can be disastrous for their mental health.",
      "\u201cWith one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as \u2018behavioral cocaine,\u2019\u201d Communications Minister Anika Wells told the National Press Club in Canberra last week.",
      "While many parents and even their children have welcomed the ban, others say it will hinder young people\u2019s ability to express themselves and connect with others, as well as access online support that is crucial for those from marginalized groups or living in isolated parts of rural Australia. Two 15-year-olds have brought a legal challenge against it to the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "Supporters say the rest of the world will soon follow the example set by the Australian ban, which faced fierce resistance from social media companies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always referred to this as the first domino, which is why they pushed back,\u201d Julie Inman Grant, who regulates online safety as Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, said at an event in Sydney last week.",
      "Social media companies will be responsible for enforcing the ban, paying fines of up to 49.5 Australian dollars (about $32 million) for serious or repeated breaches. Children and parents will not be punished for any infringements.",
      "Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, X, Snapchat and Reddit are all set to be age-restricted under the law, according to a list shared by the eSafety Commissioner. All of the platforms have said they will comply, and some have taken action before the ban even takes effect, with Meta saying last month that it would start closing Instagram, Threads and Facebook accounts on Dec. 4.",
      "The ban has broad support in Australia, where a YouGov poll last year found that 77% of respondents were in favor of it. Supporters say it will encourage children to prioritize in-person interactions, boosting their social skills.",
      "\u201cSocial media is a misnomer,\u201d said Jen Hummelshoj, 45, mother of 12-year-old Nina. \u201cThe apps want kids to be focused on their phone and not their friends.\u201d",
      "Nina does not have a phone or any social media accounts. She supports the ban\u2019s intent, arguing that social media is an overpowering distraction for young people.",

      "According to a national study the Australian government commissioned this year, 96% of children ages 10 to 15 use social media. Seven out of 10 of them have been exposed to harmful content and behavior, including misogynistic material, fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.",
      "One in 7 also reported having experienced grooming-type behavior from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.",
      "William Young, 14, said most social media platforms, in their current form, were unsafe for children, citing Snapchat as an example.",
      "\u201cYou can friend anyone without knowing who they are. It deletes messages after they\u2019ve sent. \u2026  It\u2019s just not a good platform,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Perth.",
      "He implored the affected platforms to \u201cdo right\u201d by young people and prioritize making their platforms safer.",
      "The platforms say they share that goal and insist that the ban will actually make young users less safe.",
      "\u201cDisconnecting teens from their friends and family doesn\u2019t make them safer \u2014 it may push them to less safe, less private messaging apps,\u201d Snap said in a statement last month.",
      "The platforms also argue that young users may turn to new, unregulated apps that push them into darker corners of the internet or may try to circumvent the ban by using virtual private networks, or VPNs, which Australian teenagers do not dispute.",
      "\u201cYoung people are going to find another way around it,\u201d Chloe Song, 14, said in a Zoom interview from Melbourne. \u201cStrict parents create, like, sneaky kids.\u201d",
      "She said she and her peers would benefit more from better digital literacy programs in their schools.",
      "\u201cThe next generation is in our hands,\u201d said Chloe, who is a member of Project Rockit, a youth-driven Australian movement against bullying, hate and prejudice.",
      "If young people are blocked from social media, \u201cwe just don\u2019t learn the life skills and we don\u2019t learn the experience of going through and knowing what\u2019s safe and what\u2019s not,\u201d she said.",
      "Susan Grantham, a social media researcher at Griffith University in Brisbane, described the ban as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d but not a solution on its own.",
      "\u201cSocial media is not going away. Instead, we need to create well-balanced digital citizens,\u201d she said.",
      "What rankles many young Australians about the ban is what Noah Jones described as a lack of consultation on \u201clegislation that specifically affects us.\u201d",
      "Noah, 15, one of two teenagers suing the Australian government over the ban, said he and his peers have \u201csolutions to all the negatives of social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we just got asked, we all could\u2019ve worked it out,\u201d he said in emailed comments.",
      "Noah argues the ban will deny young people freedom of political communication, an implied right in Australia\u2019s constitution, and deprive them of an essential educational tool.",
      "\u201cDo you want 15-year-old boys to have no clue about consent? Do you want teenagers who don\u2019t know about the dangers of vaping? Both topics I\u2019ve learned about on social media,\u201d he said.",
      "Wells, the communications minister, said that the center-left government would not be intimidated by legal challenges and that it \u201cremains steadfastly on the side of parents.\u201d",
      "Others are relieved by the ban, including Aalia Elachi and her father, Dany.",
      "Dany Elachi said Aalia\u2019s behavior changed within days of her receiving a smartphone at age 10.",
      "\u201cWe found that she retreated into her room, into her own private world, her own private space, and we didn\u2019t think that was, in the long run, going to be healthy for her,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Sydney.",
      "When the phone malfunctioned after a couple of months, Aalia\u2019s parents never replaced it.",
      "Now 16, Aalia will be able to legally use social media, but she has never had any accounts and said that is not about to change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still as tech literate as the next 16-year-old. I just don\u2019t have TikTok or Instagram eating up hours of my childhood every day,\u201d Aalia told lawmakers in the state of New South Wales last month.",
      "\u201cHaving firm boundaries around social media hasn\u2019t made my life smaller,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is over the next few years, I won\u2019t be the exception, but the norm.\u201d"

      "\u201cOne of those arrested is an official in the Kish free trade zone,\u201d the Islamic republic\u2019s judiciary said in a statement Saturday on its official website Mizan Online, referring to the area on the island off Iran's southern coast that offers tax exemptions and customs duty relief for businesses and foreign companies.",
      "The second person arrested \u201cworks for the private company that organized the race,\u201d the judiciary added.",
      "The marathon was held Friday on Kish Island and drew more than 5,000 participants, local media reported.",
      "Images of female runners also spread online. Some showed them documenting the marathon and posing with their medals after they finished the 26.2-mile race. Some were without a hijab, while others wore headband-style coverings that sat across the forehead and scalp but did not conceal their ponytails or braids.",
      "Right after the race the island\u2019s public prosecutor told Mizan Online that warnings about the need to follow national laws, religious norms and professional rules in holding the marathon had been ignored.",
      "The organizers \u201cdid not take these warnings seriously\u201d and violated \u201cpublic decency\u201d by allowing women to compete without the legally required headscarf, or hijab, Ali Salemizadeh said.",
      "Iran\u2019s Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution, a conservative-dominated body that sets the country\u2019s cultural and educational policies, also criticized the race in a statement reported by the state-run broadcaster, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).",
      "Calling the behavior \u201cshame breaking and organized,\u201d it said security and judicial bodies should identify and deal firmly with such movements to prevent similar cases from happening again.",
      "The hijab has been compulsory for women in Iran since the early 1980s, accompanied by stringent dress code regulations mandating modest, loose-fitting clothing in public.",
      "However, enforcement of the laws has been less consistent after nationwide protests following the death of Mahsa Amini on Sept. 16, 2022. Amini, 22, an Iranian Kurdish woman, died in a hospital three days after the country\u2019s morality police detained her for allegedly not adhering to the rules about headscarves for women and other clothing restrictions.",
      "The intense crackdown that followed has largely stifled the protest movement, with new detentions and legislation.",
      "But in an interview with NBC News this year, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said forcing women to wear the hijab and recent crackdowns in his country were wrong. \u201cHuman beings have a right to choose,\u201d he said.",
      "And speaking at Beheshti University in the capital, Tehran, on Sunday, Pezeshkian said that hijab regulations shouldn\u2019t be imposed through coercion, according to the IRIB.",
      "\u201cThe issue of hijab is not a simple matter and cannot be resolved through compulsion or confrontation,\u201d the broadcaster quoted Pezeshkian as saying. He added that the government must act \u201cpersuasively,\u201d rather than rely on force.",
      "However, his more moderate stance has sparked backlash from more hard-line factions in the Iranian government, a theocratic structure that is ultimately ruled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "Amin Khodadadi reported from Tehran and Elmira Aliieva from London."

      "A skydiving trip in Australia took a harrowing turn when one person\u2019s parachute became entangled in the tail of the plane, stranding them at 15,000 feet.",
      "The aircraft, a Cessna 208 Caravan, was carrying one pilot and 17 parachutists, including a camera operator, on Sept. 20 as they attempted a 16-person formation jump over the northernmost part of the state of Queensland.",
      "The camera operator stepped out first, holding on to the fuselage of the plane. When the first skydiver emerged, a handle securing their reserve chute got caught on the plane\u2019s flap over the wing, prompting the chute to deploy inadvertently, according to a video and a report about the incident released Thursday by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.",
      "The chute dragged the skydiver backward, knocking the camera operator off the plane and into free fall. The skydiver, who has not been publicly identified, flew straight into the plane\u2019s horizontal stabilizer on the left side of the tail, and the chute became wrapped around it, leaving the skydiver suspended.",
      "The pilot, unaware of what had happened, felt the aircraft suddenly pitch up, and noticed the airspeed rapidly decreasing. Believing the aircraft had stalled, the pilot increased power to regain airspeed but reduced it after being told a skydiver was hung up on the tail.",
      "Thirteen other parachutists exited the plane in quick succession, while two remained in the doorway. They watched as the skydiver used a hook knife \u2014 which is not mandatory equipment \u2014 to cut through 11 ropes connected to the chute, enabling it to tear free in about 50 seconds.",
      "But that was only the first problem.",
      "The skydiver then deployed the main parachute, but it was tangled with the remnants of the reserve chute. The skydiver fell about 7,000 feet from the plane before the main lines fully unwound from the dangling reserve line and functioned normally for the remainder of the descent, the report said.",
      "All parachutists landed safely, including the camera operator and the first skydiver, who sustained minor leg injuries from hitting the horizontal stabilizer.",
      "Meanwhile, the pilot was having control difficulties because the impact of the skydiver had damaged the horizontal stabilizer, which still had part of the reserve chute wrapped around it.",
      "The pilot, who was wearing an emergency parachute, was prepared to bail out from the plane if necessary, but was ultimately able to land safely at Tully Airport, officials said.",
      "According to the report, the Far North Freefall Club, which organized the jump, now requires all parachutists to carry a hook knife.",
      "\u201cCarrying a hook knife \u2014 although it is not a regulatory requirement \u2014 could be lifesaving in the event of a premature reserve parachute deployment,\u201d ATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said, adding that parachutists should be mindful of their handles, especially when exiting a plane."

      "Will this Saturday see a shocking, sad and incredibly premature end to Mohamed Salah\u2019s career at Liverpool, as one of the greatest players in their history could suddenly say goodbye after a truly incredible meltdown?",
      "It feels like \u201cThe Egyptian King\u201d is about to be dethroned and sensationally leave Liverpool, despite being their star player, becoming a Premier League legend over the last few years and still being one of the best forwards on the planet.",
      "Why?",
      "And how did things devolve so quickly for a club that won the league last season in dominant fashion and then added several star players in the offseason?",
      "Last weekend, Salah fumed publicly about being named as a substitute in Liverpool\u2019s last three games, including never seeing the pitch against Leeds before he lost the plot and was left out of the squad for Liverpool's huge 1-0 win at Inter Milan on Tuesday as a consequence of his incredible rant to reporters.",
      "\u201cI have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season,\u201d Salah said. \u201cNow I\u2019m sitting on the bench and I don\u2019t know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,\" he said.",
      "\u201cHow I see it now is like you throw Mo under the bus because he is the problem in the team now. But I don\u2019t think I am the problem. I have done so much for this club. The respect, I want to get it. I don\u2019t have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it. I am not bigger than anyone, but I earned my position. It\u2019s football. It is what it is.\u201d",
      "Imagine Tom Brady being benched by the New England Patriots. Would he be happy about it? Nope. Would he say something like this in public about it? Probably not.",
      "For a current NFL comparison, this would be similar to the Kansas Chiefs benching Patrick Mahomes because of their poor record this season. How would he react?",
      "That is why Salah\u2019s public comments have caused so much uproar. You keep things like this in-house. Now you\u2019ve created one heck of a mess and you\u2019re watching everyone scramble around you, at a time when reigning Premier League champions Liverpool are already scrambling and struggling for wins.",
      "Ahead of their game against Brighton this Saturday, Liverpool manager Arne Slot is noncommittal on whether Salah will be welcomed back into his squad. Slot, who looks genuinely hurt and disappointed with the situation, is one of the nice guys and has let Salah stew on his comments and put the ball in his court when it comes to reconciliation.",
      "Liverpool is unbeaten in the four games since Salah was benched and have genuinely improved their overall performance. Has Slot made the right call? Time will tell. But right now, he has the upper hand.",
      "Given Salah\u2019s truly unbelievable words to reporters, it seems likely he\u2019s played his last game for Liverpool. He will head to Morocco after Saturday\u2019s game as he will captain Egypt during the Africa Cup of Nations tournament. He\u2019s not scheduled to be back at Liverpool until after the January transfer window opens. The timing of Salah\u2019s meltdown is clearly significant. If he\u2019s going to stay on the bench, he wants out. In Salah\u2019s eyes, Liverpool have a month to figure it out.",
      "Most think we will never see Salah, who has been instrumental in Liverpool's return to glory and its winning two Premier League titles, a Champions League trophy and several other trophies over the last decade, in a Liverpool jersey again.",
      "It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s a shame. But even if nobody wants to admit it, it has been heading this way for a few months.",
      "Salah, 33, has been hammered by Liverpool club legends, fans and pretty much everyone else after his rant. Salah, the third-highest scorer in the club's famed history with 250 goals, was not meant to end his legendary Liverpool career this way. He was supposed to lead them to more titles and build on his wonderful 2024-25 season, as he put together one of the greatest campaigns the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "But his drop off this season, like Liverpool\u2019s as a team, has been stark. The reigning champs are languishing in the middle of the pack and have won just two of their last 10 games in the Premier League to all but end their hopes of back-to-back titles.",
      "That downturn has come amid a summer of huge spending on new superstars who have been slow to gel, the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota in July, which has hit Salah and his Liverpool teammates extremely hard, and the departure of long-time star Trent Alexander-Arnold.",
      "New superstars Alexander Isak, Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz (who cost a combined $400 million this summer) played well together as a trio without Salah at Inter Milan in midweek, and Dominik Szoboszlai started in Salah\u2019s place on the right and is a more defensive, robust option. For Liverpool as a team, it\u2019s working right now, sans Salah.",
      "If Salah is to leave Liverpool in the coming weeks, will he even be allowed on the Anfield pitch against Brighton to say goodbye on Saturday? Will most of Liverpool\u2019s fans inside the hallowed ground greet him with warmth? Or will he be lambasted for the way he\u2019s aired Liverpool\u2019s dirty laundry in public? The bitter divide he\u2019s created was the last thing Liverpool needed as they continue to struggle on the pitch.",
      "Does Salah have a point with some of his rant? Maybe.",
      "He\u2019s been nowhere near his best \u2014 most would say that\u2019s been the case since he signed his huge new contract in April \u2014 but neither has the majority of Liverpool\u2019s players this season. But it\u2019s the fact that he sees himself as undroppable and a guaranteed starter no matter what that has upset Slot, Liverpool legends and fans the most.",
      "Even if you think you\u2019re irreplaceable, as all super-talented and driven athletes like Salah usually do, you can\u2019t say it out loud. Or you shouldn\u2019t.",
      "Salah probably deserves some extra leeway amid Liverpool\u2019s struggles. But with the team going through its biggest slump in a  decade, all eyes have been on Salah. And he wasn\u2019t performing. Even if he didn\u2019t think he was the main problem, now he is.",
      "The problem Salah has is that you can clearly make the argument that Liverpool looks like a better, more solid and balanced team since Slot dropped him. It is scoring goals and looking cohesive and fluid in attack. Hence, Salah\u2019s rant to remind everyone just how important and special he is and how he deserves more respect and shouldn\u2019t have to play by the same rules as everyone else. But he does. Even if he doesn\u2019t see eye-to-eye with the manager.",
      "\u201cI said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager and all of a sudden, we don\u2019t have any relationship,\u201d Salah said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn\u2019t want me in the club.\u201d",
      "Compared to his public outburst on his contract situation last November, the difference this time is that most Liverpool fans aren\u2019t on Salah\u2019s side. These comments were so strong that it has probably cost Salah a statue outside Anfield. Will this be remembered 25 years from now? Probably.",
      "But why now? Why did he decide to go all-in on the club and Slot?",
      "Because it\u2019s not only about Salah lashing out and making sure everyone knows he\u2019s not the problem at Liverpool. It\u2019s about him ending this on his terms. He knows he\u2019s heading away on international duty with Egypt for the next few weeks, at least, and he may be sold by the start of January.",
      "Salah wants to control the situation and, in his eyes, these comments have allowed him to do it. It also puts pressure on Slot, and Salah may think that by the time he returns in January, Slot may be fired if Liverpool\u2019s poor form in the league continues.",
      "But after saying what he did, Salah now doesn\u2019t control his Liverpool farewell. If he\u2019s not on the bench and in the matchday squad against Brighton on Saturday, then usually he would not be  permitted to be on the pitch around the game.",
      "\u201cI said to my family, come to the Brighton game \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I am going to play or not, but I am going to enjoy it,\u201d Salah said. \u201cIn my head, I\u2019m going to enjoy that game because I don\u2019t know what is going to happen now. I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa Cup. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen when I am there.\u201d",
      "Will Liverpool put Salah\u2019s comments aside to allow him to say an emotional goodbye to fans at Anfield this weekend? That would make the hierarchy and Slot look weak if the rift with Salah isn\u2019t resolved before Saturday.",
      "Salah\u2019s Liverpool career may have already ended the moment he opened his mouth in the mixed zone last weekend, and now he has to deal with the consequences.",
      "If this is it for Salah, it\u2019s a sad end to one of the greatest careers in Premier League history. Liverpool\u2019s Egyptian King looks set to step off his throne quietly and without any kind of adulation or grand send-off from Anfield."
