      "Refugee children in Kenya's Kakuma camp are turning to dance to cope with harsh conditions",
      "KALOBEYEI, Kenya -- Beads of sweat drip from the faces of young girls and boys as they dance to the rhythm of traditional drums and open calabashes, while their peers watch them in awe.",
      "These are refugee children, some who were born in one of Africa\u2019s largest camps \u2014 Kakuma, located in northern Kenya, where more than 300,000 refugees\u2019 livelihoods have been affected by funding cuts that have halved monthly food rations.",
      "The children use the Acholi traditional dance as a distraction from hunger and have perfected a survival skill to skip lunches as they stretch their monthly food rations that are currently at 30% of the U.N nutritional recommendation per person.",
      "The Acholi people, mostly from Uganda and South Sudan, are among refugees who live in Kakuma camp, which was established in 1992 as a safe haven for people fleeing conflict from dozens of east African countries.",
      "For a moment, the melodious sound of one of the refugee mothers stops the playground buzz of activity as dozens of children sit down to enjoy the traditional dance performance.",
      "The colorful swings doting the community center at Kakuma\u2019s Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement were donated by a Swiss organization, Terre des hommes, which still manages the playground aptly named \u201cFuraha\u201d \u2014 Swahili for Happiness.",
      "But the happiness of these children isn't guaranteed now as funding cuts have affected operations here. Fewer resources and staff are available to engage the children and ensure their safety.",
      "One of the dancers, Gladis Amwony, has lived in Kakuma for 8 years now. In recent years, she has started taking part in the Acholi traditional dances to keep her Ugandan roots alive.",
      "The now 20-year-old doesn't imagine ever going back to Uganda and has no recollection of life in her home village.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happiest when I dance, I feel connected to my ancestors,\u201d the soft-spoken Amwony says after her dance session.",
      "While Amwony and her friends are looking for a cultural connection, just about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from their village in neighboring Kalobeyei Village 3, some boys are in touch with modernity.",
      "The five boys have been practicing a one-of-a-kind dance where they mimic robots, complete with face masks that hide their human faces.",
      "They make their sharp synchronized moves that they have been perfecting for months.",
      "The boys will be part of performances that will be showcased during this year\u2019s World Refugee Day, as an example of the talent and resilience that exists among the refugee community.",
      "This younger generation of dancers make precision moves in a small hall with play and learning items stored in a cabinet that is branded with an American flag, an indication that it was donated by the U.S government.",
      "Such donations are now scarce, with the United States having cut down on funding in March.",
      "These cuts have affected operations here, with the future stardom hopes for these children dimming by the day.",
      "The center, which previously featured daily programs such as taekwondo and ballet, may not be operational in a few months if the funding landscape remains as is.",
      "\u201cWe are now reducing some of the activities because we are few. The staff are few and even per day we only have one staff remaining in the center and it is really hard for him/her to conduct 500 children,\u201d said John Papa, a community officer for Terre des hommes in Kalobeyei Village 3.",
      "These programs do more than entertain the children \u2014 they keep them away from issues such as child labor, abuse and crime which as a major concern for humanitarian organizations in Kakuma.",
      "And as the children dance and play beneath the sweltering sun, the only hope is that these child friendly spaces remain operational for years.",

      "The sky itself is no limit for billionaire Jeff Bezos and fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The Italian city of Venice was making waves Friday with the most anticipated wedding of 2025 \u2014 that of billionaire Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez. The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most enchanting cities as backdrop? Check.",
      "Star-studded guestlist and tabloid buzz? Of course.",
      "Local flavor? You bet.",
      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",
      "The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall.",
      "Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for protests.",
      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",
      "\u201cThere will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride\u2019s dress, over the ceremony,\u201d Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Daniela Santanch\u00e8, told the AP.",
      "\u201cAll of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice \u2014 our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it\u2019s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.\u201d",
      "As Amazon\u2019s CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $231 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with S\u00e1nchez, a former TV news anchor. S\u00e1nchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos\u2019 divorce was finalized.",
      "He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.",
      "Sitting beside S\u00e1nchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.",
      "Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.",

      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin\u2019s sons William and Ryan confirmed his death to trade outlets. The Associated Press\u2019 messages to Schifrin\u2019s publicist and representatives for either brother were not immediately returned.",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d \u201cThe Fox,\u201d \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and \u201cThe Sting II.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe movie dictates what the music will be.\u201d",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan. But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \u201conly the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\u201d by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\u201cThe producer called me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it\u2019s going to start with a fuse,\u2019\u201d Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \u201cSo I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that\u2019s why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\u201d",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin\u2019s music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin\u2019s music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\u201cI remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\u201d Giacchino told NPR. \u201cAnd I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, \u2018Just have fun with it.\u2019 And I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996\u2019s first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand\u2019s Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band. Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie\u2019s quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \u201cGillespiana.\u201d",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965\u2019s \u201cJazz Suite on the Mass Texts\u201d while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \u201cTango,\u201d \u201cRush Hour\u201d and its two sequels, \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge of San Luis Rey,\u201d \u201cAfter the Sunset\u201d and the horror film \u201cAbominable.\u201d",
      "Writing the arrangements for \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d Schifrin decided that the main character wasn\u2019t in fact Clint Eastwood\u2019s hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\u201cYou would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI wrote a theme for Scorpio.\u201d",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\u201cReceiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\u201d Schifrin said at the time. \u201cIt is mission accomplished.\u201d",
      "Among Schifrin\u2019s conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California\u2019s Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \u201cChristmas in Vienna\u201d in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \u201cLetters from Argentina,\u201d nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event\u2019s 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \u201cSongs of the Aztecs.\u201d The work premiered at Mexico\u2019s Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site\u2019s Aztec temple.",
      "\u201cI found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cBut the real answer is that there\u2019s something magic about it. ... There\u2019s something magic in the art of music anyway.\u201d",
      "In addition to his sons, he\u2019s survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "Bruce Springsteen isn't the only musician to complete or launch anticipated album projects, then to see it never see the light of day",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea that Bruce Springsteen wrote, recorded and ultimately shelved entire albums of music may seem odd to the casual listener. Why put yourself through all that work for nothing?",
      "Yet \u201clost albums\u201d are embedded in music industry lore. Some were literally lost. Some remained unfinished or unreleased because of tragedy, shortsighted executives or creators who were perfectionist \u2014 or had short attention spans.",
      "Often, the music is eventually made public, like Springsteen is doing now, although out of context from the times in which it was originally made.",
      "So in honor of Springsteen's 83-song \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums\u201d box set being released Friday, The Associated Press has collected 10 examples of albums that were meant to be but weren't.",
      "Back in the news with the death of Brian Wilson, this album \u201cinvented the category of the lost masterpiece in popular music,\u201d says Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Some of the material that surfaced suggested Wilson, the Beach Boys' chief writer, was well on his way: the majestic single \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d the centerpiece \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and the reflective \u201cSurf's Up.\u201d Wilson succumbed to internal competitive pressure worsened by mental illness and drug abuse while making it in 1966 and 1967, eventually aborting the project. He later finished it as a solo album backed by the Wondermints in 2004. The better-known songs were joined with some psychedelic-era curios that displayed Wilson's melodic sense and matchless ability as a vocal arranger, along with lyrics that some fellow Beach Boys worried were too \u201cout there.\u201d",
      "The mercurial Prince pulled back this disc, set for release in December 1987, at the last minute. Some promo copies had already slipped out, and it was so widely bootlegged that when Warner Bros. officially put it out in limited release in 1994, the company billed it as \u201cThe Legendary Black Album.\u201d Encased in an all-black sleeve, the project was said to be Prince's nod to Black fans who may have felt they had lost him to a pop audience. It's almost nonstop funk, including a lascivious Cindy Crawford tribute and the workout \u201cSuperfunkycalifragisexy.\u201d The maestro's instincts were well-placed, though. Coming after \u201cSign O' the Times\u201d \u2014 arguably his peak \u2014 this would have felt like a minor project.",
      "Written and recorded in 2003, Green Day's \u201cCigarettes and Valentines\u201d was actually lost; someone apparently stole the master tapes. Feeling on a creative roll, the rock trio decided against recreating what they'd done and pressed on with new material. Smart move. The result was \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d the band's best work. Perhaps the robbery was \u201cjust a sign that we made a crappy record and we should make a better one,\u201d songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told MTV. The title cut later surfaced on a 2010 live album. The rest was lost to time.",
      "To say anticipation was high for Dr. Dre\u2019s third album when he started recording in 2002 puts it mildly. The theme disc about a hitman, which Dre described as a \u201chip-hop musical,\u201d had an all-star squad of contributors including Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\u2019ll probably ever have a chance to listen to,\u201d co-producer Scott Storch told MTV. But we never have. When he announced a different third album in 2015, Dre explained on his radio show what happened to \u201cDetox\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t good. ... I worked my ass off on it, and I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job.\u201d",
      "A series of unfinished demos, \u201cBlack Gold\u201d was a taste of where guitar god Jimi Hendrix might have gone creatively if he hadn't died at 27 in 1970. He was composing a song suite about an animated Black superhero, says Tom Maxwell, whose podcast \u201cShelved\u201d unearths stories behind lost music. Hendrix sent a tape of his work to longtime drummer Mitch Mitchell for advice on fleshing it out. That music was set aside at Mitchell's home and forgotten for two decades after Hendrix died. To date, Hendrix's estate has made only one of these recordings public, a song called \u201cSuddenly November Morning.\u201d Hendrix, after clearing his throat, slips in and out of falsetto while accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar.",
      "Written while Yoko Ono was separated from John Lennon during his infamous \u201clost weekend\u201d in 1973-74, \u201cA Story\u201d had the potential of changing the musical narrative around her. It was a strong album \u2014 without the avant-garde stylings that made Ono a challenge for mainstream listeners \u2014 recorded with musicians who worked on Lennon's \u201cWalls & Bridges.\u201d Maxwell calls it \u201can emancipation manifesto\u201d that was set aside when Ono reconciled with Lennon. She's never publicly explained why, Maxwell says, although one song seems clearly about an affair she had while Lennon was away. Some of the material from \u201cA Story\u201d was included as part of the \u201cOnobox\u201d project that came out in 1992, and the album was released separately in 1997. Ono also re-recorded some of its songs in 1980, and Lennon was holding a tape of her composition \u201cIt Happened\u201d when he was shot and killed. In it, she sings about an unspecified, seemingly traumatic event: \u201cIt happened at a time of my life when I least expected.\u201d That wasn't even the most chilling premonition. Her song \u201cO'Oh\u201d ended with firecrackers that sound like gunshots. It was left off the 1997 release.",
      "Guns N' Roses was at the top of the hard rock world when they began recording a new album in 1994. It didn't go well. Inconclusive sessions slogged on for years, and all but singer Axl Rose left the group. Recording costs exceeded a staggering $13 million, by some accounts the most expensive rock album ever. One witness told The New York Times in 2005: \u201cWhat Axl wanted to do was to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on indefinitely, which is what they've done.\u201d When \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d was finally released in 2008, the world yawned.",
      "Not even a decade after the triumph of \u201cWhat's Going On,\u201d Marvin Gaye was floundering. His \u201cHere, My Dear\u201d divorce album flopped, he struggled with drugs and searched for relevance in the disco era. The single \u201cEgo Tripping Out,\u201d meant to herald a new album, laid bare the problems: Over a melody cribbed from Donna Summer's \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d the famously cool \u201cLove Man\u201d boasted like an insecure rapper. He scrapped the album, repurposing some its material for the 1981 disc \u201cIn Our Lifetime,\u201d a process so fraught he bitterly left his longtime label Motown. Gaye went to CBS, made a huge comeback with \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d then was shot dead by his father in 1984.",
      "Neil Young rivals Prince in the volume of material left in his vault, and he's been systematically releasing much of it. The mostly acoustic \u201cHomegrown\u201d was recorded as 1974 bled into 1975, during Young's breakup with actor Carrie Snodgress. Instead of releasing it in 1975, he put out another heartbreak album, the well-regarded \u201cTonight's the Night,\u201d about losing friends to drug abuse. When Young finally dropped \u201cHomegrown\u201d in 2020, he wrote in his blog, \u201cSometimes life hurts. This is the one that got away.\u201d",
      "Of the discs included in Springsteen's \u201cTracks II\u201d set, this was reportedly the closest to being released, in the spring of 1995. After the success of the Oscar-winning song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia,\u201d Springsteen recorded an album in the same vein, with a synthesizer and West Coast rap-inspired drum loops setting the musical motif. Strikingly contemporary for its time, Springsteen ultimately felt it was too similar to previous releases dominated by dark stories about relationships. \u201cI always put them away,\u201d he said of his lost albums. \u201cBut I don't throw them away.\u201d",

      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years",
      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that \u2014 but things are speeding up.",
      "On Wednesday, Amazon MGM Studio announced that Denis Villeneuve will direct the 26th Bond movie, putting the franchise in the hands of one of the most respected big-budget filmmakers. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007.",
      "Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (\u201cConclave\u201d) and Paul King (\u201cPaddington 2\u201d). Since emerging with 2010's \u201cIncendies,\" Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (\"Blade Runner 2049,\" \u201cDune\u201d) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (\"Sicaro,\" \u201cArrival\u201d).",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "The culmination for Villeneuve has been the \u201cDune\u201d films. His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer, with a cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem.",
      "\"I\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are shepherding the movie for the first time. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's \u201cDr. No.\u201d",
      "The most likely timing would be production starting in 2026 and the film being released sometime in 2027.",
      "No new 007 has been named, but that hasn't stopped rumors and conjecture from running rampant.",
      "It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Those include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James, Aaron Pierre, Henry Cavill, James Norton and Jack Lowden. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand.",
      "Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. In his five-film, 15-year stretch in the tuxedo, Daniel Craig was widely seen as one of the best Bonds, including the high point of \u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) and the swan song of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021).",
      "Since Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control.",
      "That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like \u201cStar Wars.\u201d So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u201ccommitted crime after crime\u201d but thought his \u201cfame, wealth and power\u201d put him above the law, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday as the hip-hop mogul\u2019s sex trafficking trial shifted to closing arguments.",
      "\u201cThat ends now,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find the defendant guilty.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, sat with his head down as Slavik highlighted testimony and evidence from the seven-week trial that she said proved sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Wearing a sweater and khakis, he sometimes scribbled notes to his lawyers and shook his head as Slavik played one of his audio messages for the jury.",
      "\u201cOver the last several weeks, you\u2019ve learned a lot about Sean Combs,\u201d Slavik said, launching into a nearly five-hour presentation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\u201d",
      "Among the proof, Slavik argued, was evidence that Combs kidnapped an employee, was involved in setting rapper Kid Cudi\u2019s convertible ablaze, bribed a hotel guard and carried out \u201cbrutal crimes at the heart of this case.\u201d",
      "Combs \u201cagain and again forced, threatened and manipulated\u201d his ex-girlfriends Cassie and Jane into \u201chaving sex with escorts for his own entertainment,\u201d Slavik said, her lectern directly in front of jurors.",
      "The prosecutor said Combs forced or coerced Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, and Jane, who testified under a pseudonym, to engage in dayslong sex marathons known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights\u201d with drugs, violence, or by threatening financial harm or the release of video recordings of some of the hundreds of encounters.",
      "\u201cUp until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Bookending the trial\u2019s start, jurors again saw now-infamous security footage of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016 after she tried to leave a freak-off with a male sex worker.",
      "\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing. That is sex trafficking,\u201d Slavik told the jury, adding that Combs was \u201cknowingly using force and coercion to get Cassie back to that room where the escort was waiting.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201ccounted on silence and shame\u201d to enable and prolong his abuse. He used a \u201csmall army\u201d of employees, including personal assistants and bodyguards, to harm women and cover it up, she said.",
      "The theory of racketeering law is that \u201cwhen someone commits crime as part of a group, they\u2019re more powerful and dangerous,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses \u2014 the enterprise.\u201d",
      "Combs and his inner circle \u201ccommitted hundreds of racketeering acts,\u201d she said.",
      "Members of Combs\u2019 family, including several of his children, watched from wooden benches in the packed courtroom. At one point, he gave them a thumbs-up.",
      "Since his arrest at a Manhattan hotel last September, Combs and his lawyers have insisted he is innocent, though they conceded at trial that domestic violence occurred.",
      "Combs \u201cwas abusive: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant doesn\u2019t deny the abuse. They just want to call it \u2018domestic violence\u2019 and claim it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the crimes charged.\u201d",
      "The defense will give its closing argument on Friday, followed by a prosecution rebuttal argument. Then, Judge Arun Subramanian said, he will instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers contend there was no racketeering conspiracy because no employees agreed to join any conspiracy.",
      "In her closing, Slavik said employees repeatedly agreed to commit crimes for Combs, including delivering him drugs; accompanying him to kidnap his personal assistant; and locking Cassie in a hotel room after he stomped on her face.",
      "As Slavik returned repeatedly to the topic of Combs\u2019 sex marathons, jurors saw a slide that said \u201cThe Freak Offs\u201d next to a photo of him laying on a bed bathed in red light.",
      "Slavik reminded jurors of text messages and testimony that showed that the women didn't want to participate, including one in which Jane told Combs that she felt he gave her no choice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel it\u2019s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for the house,\u201d Jane wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Issey Miyake\u2019s menswear line has returned to Paris Fashion Week with a dazzling show at the Cartier Foundation",
      "PARIS -- As Paris wilted under the ruthless June sun, Issey Miyake sent out a battalion of intergalactic fashion soldiers at the Cartier Foundation Thursday, shimmering between art and menswear apparel in a spectacle where even the light was a player. The late-morning sun bounced sharply off the art museum's monumental steel pillars, forcing some guests to slide their seats to escape the dazzling reflections \u2014 an impromptu game of musical chairs set to a pulsing, kinetic soundtrack.",
      "This Paris Fashion Week season finds the Miyake house in the midst of transition. In January, Paris bid adieu to Homme Pliss\u00e9 \u2014 Miyake\u2019s pleated cult favorite that had anchored the city\u2019s menswear calendar since 2019 \u2014 as the brand shifted its focus to nomadic shows, most recently appearing under the Tuscan sun. The torch in Paris has now been passed to IM Men, the last line personally conceived by Issey Miyake before his death in 2022. Thursday\u2019s show marked IM Men\u2019s return to the Paris stage, under the direction of designers Sen Kawahara, Yuki Itakura, and Nobutaka Kobayashi.",
      "The theme, \u201cDancing Texture,\u201d nodded to the ceramic artistry of Shoji Kamoda, but also to the surreal choreography on display. Models appeared to roll, tilt, and swing through the light, their movements somewhere between ballet and a slow-motion video game. Occasionally, a guest would squint, unsure if they were watching a runway show or a heat-induced hallucination.",
      "The crowd \u2014 equal parts Parisian cool, visiting editors, and those for whom a pleated culotte is a spiritual calling \u2014 dodged the sun's glare and fanned themselves in the heat, shifting for both comfort and the best sightline. The first model glided out in a mad, angular hat, setting the tone for a parade of tin man-meets-space ninja silhouettes designed for dance floors or distant planets.",
      "The clothes themselves looked as if they had been engineered for a new climate \u2014 or perhaps a new species. Surfaces peeled, rippled, and shimmered, metallic foils flashed against the sun, and jacquard weaves evoked the carved waves of Kamoda\u2019s ceramics. Vermilion and white motifs burst forth alongside a near-neon green, courtesy of upcycled fishing nets. A coat unzipped into a dramatic collar while some blousons and pants, when laid flat, formed perfect circles \u2014 a wink at Kamoda\u2019s wheel-thrown plates.",
      "Miyake, who died in 2022, loomed large over the collection, his vision unmistakable in every engineered pleat and playful transformation. IM Men is the last line he conceived \u2014 a living laboratory for innovation, risk, and occasional absurdity, now energetically interpreted by a younger team. Even in his absence, his legacy is alive in every joke, fold, and jolt of surprise on the runway.",
      "Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake rose from postwar Japan to become a global force, transforming fashion in the 1980s and \u201990s with his radical, sculptural vision. He pioneered heat-set pleating and created lines like Pleats Please and A-POC that blurred the boundaries between art, science, and daily life. Miyake\u2019s designs liberated fabric, allowing it to move with the body and imagination alike.",
      "Of course, the fashion house\u2019s embrace of the avant-garde still courts danger. Thursday's spectacle occasionally veered into excess, with kinetic art and sci-fi headgear that threatened to upstage the clothes themselves \u2014 a familiar Miyake risk. But the best moments, like a pared-back tangerine overcoat that floated past, proved restraint can sometimes steal the show.",

      "Channel 156 has been SiriusXM Fight Nation, which has carried pro wrestling, MMA and boxing shows.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited,\u201d said Dave LaGreca, the longtime host of \u201cBusted Open,\u201d which started as a one-hour weekly show in 2009. \u201cI really owe it to our fans. They've really been dedicated and asked for this for years. It's a dream come true to actually see it form. And now, it's about to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cBusted Open\u201d expanded to five days a week in 2018 before going to six days one year later. It will have a live episode seven days a week from 9 a.m.-noon EDT on the new channel featuring LaGreca with wrestling stars Bully Ray, Mark Henry and Tommy Dreamer.",
      "The show has appealed to fans of both WWE and AEW with video clips of interviews getting plenty of engagement on social media.",

      "Five nights a week there will be a \u201cBusted Open After Dark\u201d program, where fans can call in and react after WWE and AEW shows.",
      "\u201cThe great thing is we're not associated with WWE or AEW, so we can give our honest opinion about both products,\u201d said LaGreca, who signed a multi-year extension with SiriusXM. \u201cThe fact that there is a little bit of tension between those two companies and even the fans, it makes it even better for what we\u2019re doing on air. The fact that there are more companies that are succeeding at record-breaking levels is even better for our brand, and the big reason why we\u2019re going 24/7.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Eva Victor's \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is one of the more thrilling filmmaking debuts in recent years, writes Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "The first thing to love about writer-director-star Eva Victor\u2019s extraordinary debut \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is how she, as the young professor Agnes, tries, and fails, to hide a tryst with her neighbor.",
      "Agnes lives in a quaint New England home where her best friend and fellow former grad student Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is visiting. We are just getting to know each of these characters when a knock comes on the door. Gavin (Lucas Hedges) stands outside confused when Lydie answers. Agnes rushes over to act as though he\u2019s mistaken her house for his, and not for the first time.",
      "\u201cGod bless your lost soul,\u201d she says, shooing him away.",
      "The plot of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d centers around a traumatic experience for Agnes that unfolds in a chapter titled \u201cThe Year With the Bad Thing.\u201d But it would be wrong to define \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d \u2014 or its singular protagonist \u2014 by that \u201cbad thing.\u201d In this remarkably fully formed debut, the moments that matter are the funny and tender ones that persist amid crueler experiences.",
      "Before her script to \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d attracted Barry Jenkins as a producer, Victor did improv and made comic social media videos. And the degree to which she\u2019s effectively channeled her sly sense of humor and full-bodied resistance to cliche makes \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d the immediately apparent revelation of a disarmingly offbeat new voice.",
      "The film unfolds in five chapters from across five years of Agnes\u2019 life, told out of chronology. That, in itself, is a way to place the \u201cbad thing\u201d of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d in a reshuffled context. Stasis, healing and friendship are more the guiding framework of Victor\u2019s film.",
      "The opening tenor of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is, in a way, the prevailing one. Agnes and Lydie (a terrific Ackie) are best pals whose jokey chemistry is as natural as their protectiveness of each other. At a dinner with their former literature grad students, Lydie clasps Agnes\u2019 hand under the table at the mention of their former thesis adviser.",
      "In the second chapter, the \u201cbad thing\u201d one, we find out why. In an unnamed New England liberal arts school, their professor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), is charming and perceptive. He recognizes Agnes\u2019 intelligence and seems to respect her \u2014 which makes his betrayal all the more shattering. When the location of one of their meetings shifts last-minute to his home, Victor\u2019s camera waits outside while day turns to night. Only when Agnes exits, ashen and horrified, do we pick back up with her as she gets in the car and drives.",
      "In the aftermath, the trauma of the rape spills out of Agnes in unpredictable ways and at unexpected moments. With Lydie. Visiting a doctor. At jury duty. With a stray cat. These encounters \u2014 some heartwarming, some insensitive \u2014 are both Agnes\u2019 way of awkwardly processing what she went through and the movie\u2019s way of accentuating how people around you, friend or stranger, have a choice of empathy. Most movingly, in the chapter \u201cThe Year With the Good Sandwich,\u201d John Carroll Lynch plays a man who finds her having a panic attack, and sweetly sits down with her in a parking lot.",
      "Agnes doesn\u2019t process her experience the way a movie character might be expected to \u2014 with, say, revenge or sudden catharsis. Hers is a sporadic, often absurd healing that includes turning up at her neighbor\u2019s house to borrow some lighter fluid. Lydie is key. This is in many ways a portrait of a friendship, and a particularly lived-in one at that. What it\u2019s not so much is a story about sexual assault. Just as Agnes is sarcastically and self-deprecatingly resistant to convention, Victor\u2019s film sidesteps the definitions that usually accompany such a story. Originality becomes a kind of survival.",
      "\"Sorry, Baby,\u201d an A24 release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content and language. Running time: 104 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

    "story": [
      "The sequel to the horror-comedy hit \u201cM3GAN\u201d takes a bold turn into action territory",
      "If you want to know how big an upgrade the \u201cM3GAN\u201d sequel has on the original, look no further than the very first scene. \u201cM3GAN\u201d was mostly set in a Seattle house, but \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d starts at the Turkish-Iranian border \u2014 with a murderous rampage in a secret military installation and the presence of Saudi intelligence, with U.S. Defense Department officials covertly watching.",
      "Two hours later, it's not clear if this is really an upgrade.",
      "Most of the same team that gave us the refreshing horror-comedy original two years ago have not only gone super-big, but also changed the franchise's genre, turning \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d into an action movie with two AI robots, two villains, FBI units, wingsuits, neural implants, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-style vault heist, exosuits, a 250-mph street chase in a supercar, a power grid disaster, a countdown clock, the United Nations and the fate of the planet at stake.",
      "If the evil doll M3gan in the first movie was responsible for the deaths of four humans and one dog, this time the screen is littered with the corpses of shootings, decapitations, severed limbs and laser slayings. There are double-crosses, impalings, blood splatter, cattle prods, tactical military soldiers, self-destruct sequences and insane close-combat martial arts. You can be forgiven for expecting a Tom Cruise appearance.",
      "What you won't get is much of the vibe of the original, which fused horror, cultural commentary and humor. This time, that's muted in favor of an overly ambitious, horribly convoluted plot that sometimes feels like the moviemakers just threw money at the sequel and tried to ape other franchises by going massive. The first had a bedroom feel; the new one starts, like we said, on an international border. The original's $12 million budget has been tripled.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d owes a lot to \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d in which the robot killer in the first movie becomes the robot hero of the second. M3gan, it will come as no surprise, wasn't killed at the end of the original. She's just been laying low, waiting for her time to seize the day \u2014 and dance. Now she is reborn to fight another, better AI robot, played with sinister lethality by Ivanna Sakhno.",
      "\u201cM3GAN\u201d arrived in 2023 just as AI technology like ChatGPT was beginning to go mainstream. Director and screenwriter Gerard Johnstone turns Allison Williams \u2014 who plays M3gan's creator, Gemma \u2014 into a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of artificial intelligence as the sequel opens. One of the more intriguing questions the movie explores is if parents are gradually outsourcing their responsibilities to technology.",
      "Her niece Cady \u2014 the fabulous Violet McGraw \u2014 is now a budding computer programmer and rebellious. She has learned aikido and has a strong affinity for Steven Seagal, a running gag. Her protection is still the single focus of M3gan, who has apparently been in cloud networks between movies.",
      "Facing a global existential threat, Gemma is convinced to build a body for M3gan to go toe-to-toe with the military-grade AI killing machine known as Amelia. \u201cEveryone deserves a second chance,\u201d Cady tells her aunt. But whose side is M3gan really on? And what does Amelia really want?",
      "Some of the movie's best parts are when M3gan and Amelia face off. \u201cYou're not family to them,\u201d the new AI model says to the old. \u201cYou're just the help.\u201d There's some cool robotic dancing \u2014 a highlight of the original \u2014 and a return of M3gan's camel-colored silk sateen dress that became popular at Halloween.",
      "Johnstone has smartly kept the offbeat humor of the original, this time with clever nods to \u201cKnight Rider\u201d and a surreal use of the Kate Bush song \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work.\u201d Jemaine Clement from \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d has fun as an arrogant tech billionaire, while Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return as Gemma\u2019s tech teammates, this time crawling through ducts or getting choked almost to death.",
      "We wouldn't be here if someone had taken the advice of Ronny Chieng's character in the original movie: \u201cI want you to take this cyborg puppet show and put it in a dark closet where it belongs.\u201d Not after grossing $180 million worldwide. \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d was inevitable, but it didn't have to be so inevitably too much.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for \u201cstrong violent content, bloody images, some strong language, sexual material and brief drug references.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- Imagine you come from a small town in Texas and you have big dreams of being a country music star. Imagine those aspirations come true, tenfold: You win a couple Academy of Country Music Awards, a CMT Music Award and you have a couple platinum singles to your name. What's next?",
      "If you're Parker McCollum, it's new challenges. Surpassing his wildest expectations meant reveling in the carte blanche that follows \u2014 the freedom to do whatever you want. For the 33-year-old singer, that's the release of his fifth full-length project, a self-titled album out Friday.",
      "\u201cI would hang my hat on this record seven days a week,\u201d he says of the album. \u201cIt's just the most focused I've ever been.\u201d",
      "He's self-assured now, but the road to \u201cParker McCollum,\u201d the album, wasn't so steady. He originally recorded half a full-length with his longtime collaborator, producer Jon Randall. It wasn't working. \u201cI was comfortable,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I gotta go get as uncomfortable as I can.\u201d\u2019",
      "So, he scrapped what he had, went to New York, worked with a new producer, Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack, Chris Knight), and recorded what became the final album in a week.",
      "\u201cIt sounds absolutely ridiculous when you say it out loud,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy way to do it, but I think it worked.\u201d",
      "It helped that McCollum had most of the songs written. \u201cI wrote \u2018Permanent Headphones\u2019 when I was 15. I wrote \u2018My Blue\u2019 in 2019. I wrote a lot of songs last year,\u201d he says. Still, they cut \u201ca couple songs a day.\u201d He credits Liddell for pulling the best songs out of him, as well as New York's industrious energy, for helping him realize the record.",
      "\u201cI'm glowing when I'm there,\u201d he says of the city. \u201cWhen I was in high school dreaming about being on a major label cutting records, you know, 'It\u2019s going to be in New York City and it\u2019s gonna be ... like a movie. And, you know, I just decided to try and actually do that.\u201d",
      "The album possesses that vigor, from the slow-building, John Mayer-esq. \u201cNew York Is On Fire\u201d to more country-and-then-some fare: \u201cSolid Country Gold,\u201d \u201cSunny Days,\u201d and \u201cWhat Kinda Man.\u201d",
      "There's also a spirited cover of Danny O\u2019Keefe's folk classic \u201cGood Time Charlie\u2019s Got The Blues\u201d with fellow Texan singer Cody Johnson, the album's sole feature. \u201cI've played that song my entire life,\u201d McCollum says.",

      "The narrative opener \u201cMy Blue\u201d was the first song McCollum and Liddell recorded in the studio, and it was \u201ca breeze,\u201d as McCollum describes it, \"And the worst thing happened that could have possibly happened.\u201d They thought the rest of the process would be effortless, but that's not how it goes. \u201cIt was just an absolute emotional grind for the next six and a half days. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d",
      "That led to experimentation, too. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a country singer. And the more that I listen to what I do, I\u2019m like, \u2018This doesn\u2019t really sound like country music to me,\u2019 which is hard to put your thumb on nowadays, of course, what country music really is. It\u2019s just not as narrow as it used to be. But I\u2019m like, I just don\u2019t really even care anymore. You know, maybe I\u2019m not a country singer. I don\u2019t know.

      "Venetian activists say they are planning a boisterous but peaceful protest during this weekend's wedding between multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice",
      "VENICE, Italy -- This weekend's star-studded Venice wedding of multi-billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez has galvanized activist groups that are protesting it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots as well as disregard of the city's residents.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 have united to protest the multi-day event under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "They have staged small-scale protests, unfurling anti-Bezos banners on iconic Venetian sites. They were joined this week by Greenpeace and the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, to unfurl a giant banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square protesting purported tax breaks for billionaires.",
      "\u201cIF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX,\u201d read the banner, which featured a huge image of Bezos. Police quickly took it away.",
      "There has been no comment from Bezos\u2019 representatives on the protests.",
      "The local activists had planned a more organized protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. Then they modified the protest to a march from the train station after claiming a victory, asserting that their pressure forced organizers to change the venue to the Arsenale, a more easily secured site beyond Venice's congested center.",
      "\u201cIt will be a strong, decisive protest, but peaceful,\u2019\u2019 said Federica Toninello, an activist with the Social Housing Assembly network. \u201cWe want it to be like a party, with music, to make clear what we want our Venice to look like.\"",
      "Among the 200 guests confirmed to be attending the wedding are Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "Venice, renowned for its romantic canal vistas, hosts hundreds of weddings each year, not infrequently those of the rich and famous. Previous celebrity weddings, like that of George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, were embraced by the public. Hundreds turned out to wish the couple well at City Hall.",
      "Bezos has a different political and business profile, said Tommaso Cacciari, a prominent figure in the movement that successfully pushed for a ban on cruise ships over 25,000 tons traveling through the Giudecca Canal in central Venice.",
      "\u201cBezos is not a Hollywood actor,\u2019\u2019 Cacciari said. \u201cHe is an ultra-billionaire who sat next to Donald Trump during the inauguration, who contributed to his re-election and is contributing in a direct and heavy way to this new global obscurantism.\u2019\u2019",
      "Critics also cite Amazon\u2019s labor practices, ongoing tax disputes with European governments and Bezos\u2019 political associations as additional reasons for concern.",
      "Activists also argue that the Bezos wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over residents' needs. They cite measures such as the day-tripper tax \u2014 which critics argue reinforces Venice\u2019s image as a theme park \u2014 as ineffective. Chief among their concerns is the lack of investment in affordable housing and essential services.",
      "City officials have defended the wedding. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro called the event an honor for Venice, and the city denied the wedding would cause disruptions.",
      "\"Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage,\u2019\u2019 Brugnaro told The Associated Press, adding he hoped to meet Bezos while he was in town.",
      "Meanwhile, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but said contact began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "The star couple anchored a guest list at Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle that doubled as a map of contemporary culture now: Bradley Cooper, J-Hope, Karol G, Pinkpanthress, Future, Pusha T, Jackson Wang, Bambam, Mason Thames, Miles Caton, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Malcolm Washington, Jalen Ramsey, and A$AP Nast. If there was any question about the gravitational pull of Louis Vuitton under Williams, it evaporated before the first look hit the runway.",
      "This was no ordinary catwalk: Williams \u2014 half showman, half pop impresario \u2014 staged a cultural passage from Paris to Mumbai, fusing Indian tradition and modern dandyism into a punchy, sunstruck vision of the Vuitton man in 2026.",
      "In Vuitton\u2019s world, a show is never just a show. It\u2019s a takeover, a mood. On Tuesday, the Pompidou\u2019s iconic colored pipes served as a sci-fi backdrop for a set dreamed up with Studio Mumbai architect Bijoy Jain: a lifesize \u201cSnakes and Ladders\u201d board, alluding to both the child\u2019s game and the adult risks of fashion\u2019s global game. For Williams, the house\u2019s mantra of travel is less about destination, more about movemen. Up, down, sideways, sunward.",
      "The clothes? This season, they marched to their own drumbeat. Out came models in Indian-style chunky sandals, striped boxy shorts and blue preppy shirts with sleeves billowing like monsoon sails. Silken cargo pants shimmered in the sun; pin-striped puffers added a louche, almost Bollywood-kitsch edge. Cricket jerseys appeared with jeweled collars or \u2014 why not? \u2014 a puffy hood dripping with rhinestones. Blue pearlescent leather bombers flirted with the bling of Mumbai\u2019s film sets, while pin-striped tailoring riffed on both the British Raj and Parisian boulevardiers.",
      "If all this felt like cultural collision, that\u2019s by design. Williams\u2019 Vuitton has become a mood board for global wanderlust: the checked silks, the mismatched stripes, the trompe l\u2019oeil fabrics that look sun-faded by actual adventures. It\u2019s a nod to the itinerant dandyism that\u2019s fast becoming his Vuitton calling card. Less about nostalgia, more about now.",
      "But don\u2019t mistake the globe-trotting optimism for naivety. There\u2019s calculation in the chaos. Williams\u2019 references bounce from Kenzo \u2019s Nigo (his onetime collaborator) to Indian contemporary artisans \u2014 like the hand-beaded snakes slithering across shirts, or the sandalwood-scented linens that recall a summer in Rajasthan. The \u201cworldwide community\u201d Vuitton preaches is real, but it\u2019s also realpolitik: What could be more luxurious in 2025 than clothing that tries to please everyone and everywhere, without losing itself?",
      "Of course, with Vuitton, the accessories make the man and this season\u2019s bags, bejeweled sandals and hardware-heavy necklaces delivered the requisite Instagram bait, each a covetable passport stamp in leather or gold. It\u2019s maximalism, sure, but not just for the TikTok set: the craftsmanship, from sun-bleached cloth to hand-loomed stripes, rewards anyone who bothers to look twice.",
      "If there\u2019s a criticism, it\u2019s that sometimes the noise of references threatens to drown out the signal. Williams piles motif on motif, color on color, joy on joy, until coherence blurs into sheer, Dionysian energy. But maybe that\u2019s the point: In a season of global anxiety the Vuitton man chooses to strut, sparkle, and swerve.",
      "LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury group, posted record revenue of 84.7 billion euros in 2024, with its Fashion & Leather Goods division anchored by Louis Vuitton still leading the pack. With a market value near $455 billion and over 6,300 stores worldwide, Vuitton remains the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand. Even with a recent dip in sales, its scale and influence are unmatched.",
      "As the last look circled the Pompidou and the birds resettled, Vuitton\u2019s odyssey felt less like a fashion show and more like an announcement: the world is a game board, the ladders are real, and Louis Vuitton is still rolling the dice.",

      "Former teen idol Bobby Sherman has died at 81",
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and \u201970s with bubblegum pop hits like \u201cLittle Woman\u201d and \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d has died. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \u201cBobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\u201d Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide\u2019s list of \u201cTV\u2019s 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\u201d",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the \u201960s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go,\u201d and \u201cLa La La (If I Had You).\u201d He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \u201cHere Comes Bobby,\u201d which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock \u2019n\u2019 roll show \u201cShindig!\u201d in the mid-\u201960s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \u201cHere Come the Brides\u201d (1968-70) and \u201cGetting Together\u201d (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, people say, \u2018Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?\u2019\u201d he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could\u2019ve relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\u201d",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\u201cI was brought up in a fairly strict family,\u201d he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \u201cLaw and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people\u2019s feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn\u2019t do things just to be mischievous.\u201d",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \u201cShindig!\u201d",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \u201cHere Come the Brides,\u201d a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cSeattle,\u201d and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \u201cGetting Together,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman\u2019s smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\u201d The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \u201cWild In Streets,\u201d \u201cHe is My Brother\u201d and \u201cGet Crazy.\u201d",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \u201cI\u2019d film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn\u2019t know what home was.\u201d",
      "Sherman\u2019s pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family\u2019s first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cIf I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I\u2019m in my own car,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times. \u201cI carry equipment with me. And there\u2019s not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\u201d",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman\u2019s partner what his name was. \u201cWhen he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn\u2019t tell her my name was Sherman,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD\u2019s Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI\u2019s Exceptional Service Award and the \u201cTwice a Citizen\u201d Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon wrote: \u201cBobby is a stellar example of the statement \u2018to protect and serve.\u2019 We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\u201d",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \u201cTeen Idols Tour\u201d with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman\u2019s Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman\u2019s performances: \u201cDressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with \u2018Easy Come, Easy Go.\u2019 As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\u201d",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children\u2019s Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health, and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",
      "\u201cEven in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That\u2019s who Bobby was \u2014 brave, gentle, and full of light,\u201d Poublon wrote.",

      "Actor Damson Idris' career is about to hit turbo speed",
      "Damson Idris was trying to tune out the noise, but that's a little difficult at a Formula One race.",
      "The British-Nigerian actor was in the zone, in character, filming the high-octane summer movie \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt at some of the world\u2019s most famous racetracks. While Idris\u2019 profile has been rising in recent years, after six seasons starring in the FX series \u201cSnowfall,\u201d there\u2019s nothing like being next to globally famous Formula One drivers and a Hollywood megastar to put things into perspective. He was pretty sure he was going to coast under the radar.",
      "Then he started hearing not just his own name from fans in the crowd but \u201cFranklin Saint,\u201d too, the name of his drug kingpin character on \u201cSnowfall.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, because I see myself as a young actor who nobody knows,\u201d Idris, 33, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Anonymity may already be a thing of the past for Idris, though. In May, he made a splash at the Met Gala, arriving in a full racing suit (branded with \u201cF1\u2019s\u201d fictional team name APXGP) and a Swarovski crystal-studded helmet that he and two ushers removed to reveal a second look underneath. The boldness and theatricality of the stunt made it one of the most talked about moments at an event where everyone is trying to stand out.",
      "And things are poised to rev up even more when \u201cF1\u201d opens globally Friday. Speeding into theaters on a wave of great reviews and the promise of a \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d-style spectacle, filmmaker Joseph Kosinski is pretty sure Idris is going to start hearing people shout \u201cJoshua Pearce\u201d at him too.",
      "That's the name of Idris' character, the hotshot rookie driver of the worst team on the circuit who's desperate to prove himself and hang on to one of the coveted seats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for people to see him own this character and go toe to toe with a giant movie star,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cI think he can do anything. He\u2019s just super talented, and I feel like I\u2019m lucky to see him at the beginning of what\u2019s going to be a pretty stratospheric launch.\u201d",
      "Idris tries to seek out projects that challenge him and characters who are as different as possible \u2014 from each other and, especially, from him. Joshua Pearce fit the bill in a moment when he was preparing to say goodbye to Franklin Saint. After he read the \u201cF1\u201d script, the character even infiltrated his dreams.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Man, no one\u2019s going to be able to play this part like I will.\u2019 I remember writing Joe (Kosinski) a letter and telling him that,\u201d Idris said. \u201cWhen we finally jumped in the cars for the first time, I was hooked. I was like, \u2018Yep this movie\u2019s mine. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s and I can\u2019t wait to give my all to it.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cF1\u201d wouldn\u2019t just require playing a part. Both he and Pitt had to learn how to drive the cars at speeds of up to 180 mph. It took months of training behind the wheel the supervision of stunt drivers Luciano Bacheta and Craig Dolby, as well as physical training to adapt to the G-forces they\u2019d feel in the car.",
      "When it came time to film, which they did with special cameras attached to the cars, sometimes they were driving during breaks at real races with hundreds of thousands of spectators around. Every time you see Idris' or Pitt\u2019s face in the car, Kosinski said, they\u2019re really driving that car.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so insane. It\u2019s actually quicker in real life and it looks really fast on the screen,\u201d Idris said. \u201cIn a split second, a decision could be really detrimental. But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this movie any other way. If it was on green screen, you\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a bit of art-meets-life symmetry wrapped up in \u201cF1,\u201d in which an up-and-comer teams up with a veteran. In the film, it\u2019s a reluctant pairing of two alphas. The mentorship is fraught, the lessons are hard-earned and the competition is not exactly friendly. Unlike Joshua, Idris is more than willing to get advice from those around him, whether it\u2019s producers like Jerry Bruckheimer and Jeremy Kleiner, his director Kosinski, or his co-stars, from Pitt to Javier Bardem.",
      "\u201cI speak to them every day and I ask for advice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main focus is on stories, playing characters that I can be proud of and range. That\u2019s everything I\u2019m setting out to do in this career.\u201d",
      "Acting was not always the goal for Idris. Like many kids in South London, he once dreamed of being a soccer player. Sure, the idea of being a renowned athlete held some appeal, but he also loved the sheer discipline it required. Then, at age 18, he realized he\u2019d never be as great as Lionel Messi.",
      "\u201cWhen I see him one day, hopefully I\u2019m blessed to meet him, I\u2019m going to tell him that he\u2019s the reason why I quit football, because he was so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWonderfully, acting is a subjective industry, so I can at least cheat my way into working with Brad Pitt.\u201d",
      "Cheating is, of course, a bit of cheeky hyperbole for an actor who studied drama at university and continued training at London's Identity School of Acting afterward. Since he made his stage debut in Ade Solanke\u2019s \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d over 10 years ago, Idris has been hitting the pavement like the rest of his peers. And he\u2019s just getting started.",
      "Idris recently wrapped filming the Tomi Adeyemi adaptation \u201cChildren of Bone and Blood\u201d in Cape Town, South Africa. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, Idris plays Prince Inan in the African fantasy that co-stars Viola Davis, Cynthia Erivo, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris' idol and real-life mentor Idris Elba.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a namesake,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI feel so blessed to be able to say that I\u2019m like his little brother and I can call him and get advice.\u201d",
      "Next up, Idris will prepare to portray Miles Davis in Bill Pohlad\u2019s \u201cMiles & Juliette,\u201d about the jazz legend\u2019s romance with French singer Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He's also founded a fine jewelry line, named Didris, inspired by his mother, and is getting into producing as well \u2014 his production company has a deal with FX Networks and wants to make opportunities for emerging talents.",
      "And like his character in \u201cF1,\u201d Idris is learning to block out the noise. He knows that a film career is a long journey and there will be ups and downs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment, but I\u2019m fortunate to have so many people in my life that keep me grounded,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI\u2019ve soaked in information from people I admire who say the same thing during these higher moments: Pinch yourself, stay grounded, remember where you came from.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m walking through this portal and into these next couple of years. I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m humbled, I am blessed and I can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A new Idaho law restricting public benefits for undocumented immigrants is facing a legal challenge",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho doctor and four residents are challenging a new state law that halts some of the few public benefits available to people living in the U.S. unlawfully, including a program that provides access to life-saving HIV and AIDS medication for low income patients.",
      "The ACLU of Idaho filed the federal lawsuit Thursday night on behalf of Dr. Abby Davids and four people with HIV who are not named because they are immigrants without lawful permanent residency.",
      "The complaint says the new law is vague, contradicts federal law and makes it impossible for health care providers to determine exactly what kind of immigration status is excluded and how to verify that status for patients. They want a judge to grant them class-action status, expanding any ruling to other impacted people.",
      "Dozens of patients treated by one Boise-area clinic stand to lose access to HIV and AIDS medication under the law, according to the complaint, including several cared for by Davids.",
      "\u201cWithdrawing HIV treatment from her patients will not only have devastating consequences on their health, it raises the public health risk of increased HIV transmission,\u201d the ACLU wrote in the lawsuit. \u201cWhen her patients are undetectable, they cannot transmit the virus. Without HIV treatment, however, they cannot maintain an undetectable viral level and therefore are able to transmit the virus to others.\u201d",
      "The new Idaho law takes effect July 1, and appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
      "The law requires people to verify that they are legal U.S. residents to receive public benefits like communicable disease testing, vaccinations, prenatal and postnatal care for women, crisis counseling, some food assistance for children and even access to food banks or soup kitchens that rely on public funding.",
      "Federal law generally prohibits immigrants in the U.S. illegally from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Social Security. But there are some exceptions for things like emergency medical care and other emergency or public health services.",
      "Idaho\u2019s law still allows for emergency medical services. But in a June 18 letter to health care providers, Idaho Division of Public Health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said HIV is a long-term condition and not an emergency \u2014 so people must verify their lawful presence in order to get benefits through the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "The HIV patients challenging the new law include a married couple from Columbia with pending asylum applications, a man who was brought to the U.S. when he was just 4 years old and has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status until next year, and a man from Mexico who has been living and working in Idaho since 2020.",
      "One of the patients said she and her husband were diagnosed with HIV in 2019 and immediately started antiretroviral therapy, receiving the medications at no cost through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The medication has lowered the viral load in her body enough that it is now undetectable, she wrote in a court filing, ensuring that she won't transmit the virus to others.",
      "\u201cMy medication protected my daughter while I was pregnant because it prevented me from transmitting HIV to her during pregnancy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The treatment allows her to be with her child, watching her grow, she said.",
      "Davids has been trying for weeks to get clarity from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about exactly what kind of verification her patients will have to show, and exactly which kinds of immigration status are considered \u201clawful.\u201d But the state has yet to provide clear direction, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cI am really scared about what this means for many of our patients. Their lives will now be in jeopardy,\u201d Davids wrote in a May 30 email to the Department of Health and Welfare.",

      "The district is charged with eight counts of violating the federal Toxic Substances Control Act for allegedly failing to perform inspections in a timely manner during a recent five-year period.",
      "Authorities said a judge must approve the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, which avoids a grand jury indictment. If the school district complies with the relevant federal law, the government can eventually drop the charges.",
      "About 300 of the school district's aging set of 339 buildings contain asbestos, the U.S. attorney's office said in a release.",
      "Asbestos, a construction material in wide use until the 1980s, has been linked to cancer and lung disease.",
      "Investigators said some asbestos was improperly addressed and that schools have had to close as a result of asbestos problems. Prosecutors said the \u201clongstanding and widespread problem\u201d put students and teachers in danger.",
      "The deferred prosecution agreement says the school system has already improved policies, procedures and compliance regarding asbestos inspections and abatement.",
      "Superintendent Tony B. Watlington Sr. told The Philadelphia Inquirer the deferred prosecution agreement is a sign of the district's progress in addressing the problem. He noted the district will train workers on asbestos management as part of the deal.",
      "___",
      "This story has been corrected to delete a reference to a district paid monitor. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office says that is not a part of the deferred prosecution agreement.",

State health officials say they are determining the vaccination status of people being held at the facility and are providing testing kits and equipment.",
      "As of Friday, the U.S. has 1,227 measles cases nationwide as of Tuesday, including active outbreaks in 12 states.",
      "The highly contagious and vaccine-preventable illness has been spreading in New Mexico since February, starting first in Lea County \u2014 just across the border from the epicenter of the historic Texas outbreak that has sickened 750 people since late January.",
      "New Mexico had 81 confirmed measles cases Tuesday, with Thursday's announcement bringing the total to 86. One state resident died of measles in March. The adult was unvaccinated and did not seek medical care.",
      "\u201cThe cases at Luna County Detention Center are a stark reminder that the measles outbreak in New Mexico is not over,\u201d said Dr. Chad Smelser, a medical epidemiologist with the New Mexico Department of Health. \u201cWe urge everyone in New Mexico, especially Luna County residents, to ensure that they are fully vaccinated against measles.\u201d",
      "Health officials put out an alert June 17 about measles being found Deming\u2019s wastewater system, an early sign that the virus was spreading.",
      "Pablo Montoya, the facility's warden, said in a statement that the first signs of illness started a week ago and all five incarcerated people who tested positive are now in quarantine. All in-person visits are suspended and court hearings will be held virtually.",
      "New Mexico has seen a large increase in measles vaccinations since February. More than 37,500 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had been administered as of Monday, state data shows, compared to about 19,300 in the same timeframe of 2024.",
      "The measles vaccine is safe and it is 97% effective at protecting against measles after two doses. It is recommended as a routine vaccination for children across the U.S.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s vaccine advisers are bringing up an old flu-shot debate: whether it\u2019s time to wipe out the last small fraction of those vaccines that contain a controversial preservative called thimerosal.",
      "It\u2019s a question seemingly laid to rest years ago, as studies showed no evidence that the preservative causes any health problems.",
      "\u201cThis is really a nonissue,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Here are some things to know about the substance.",
      "Thimerosal is a preservative used in certain vaccines since the 1930s, as well as in some other medical products.",
      "It was mostly used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, to prevent bacterial contamination as the vessel was repeatedly punctured to withdraw a dose.",
      "Questions about thimerosal were raised in the late 1990s because it contains a form of mercury.",
      "It\u2019s not the same as the toxic type found in some seafood, called methylmercury. Instead, it\u2019s a different type called ethylmercury that the body can excrete, O\u2019Leary explained.",
      "The amount of ethylmercury per vaccine dose was small and studies found no evidence of harm. Nor was it used in all vaccines. For example, vaccines for chickenpox, polio and measles, mumps and rubella never contained it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "But as a precaution, the U.S. phased the preservative out of childhood vaccines. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children age 6 and younger in the U.S. come in formulas that don\u2019t contain thimerosal.",
      "The exception is a small subset of flu shot formulas in multi-dose vials that could be used for adults or kids. The vast majority of children, however, get their flu vaccination from a single-dose shot instead, O\u2019Leary said.",
      "According to the CDC, 96% of all flu vaccines in the U.S. administered last fall and winter \u2014 and an even higher share of those used in federally funded programs \u2014 were thimerosal-free.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime antivaccine activist, and he has long contended there was a tie between thimerosal and autism.",
      "On Thursday, his newly appointed vaccine advisers were set to hear a presentation from Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner who once ran the antivaccine group that Kennedy founded.",
      "She will suggest that the remaining thimerosal-containing flu shots should be removed, according to meeting materials posted earlier this week. Among the claims were that they could be a risk to pregnant women.",
      "A new CDC staff analysis prepared for the meeting again showed no link between the preservative and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Some experts note that autism rates rose after thimerosal was removed from young children's vaccines in the U.S.",

      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee backed another option to protect infants against a dangerous virus \u2014 before turning to questions about fall flu vaccines and a preservative in a small fraction of them that some antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday took up protections against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can dangerously inflame infants' tiny airways.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. That first antibody, called nirsevimab, proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.",
      "On Thursday, the vaccine panel voted 5-2 that another newly approved antibody shot, Merck\u2019s clesrovimab, should be used similarly.",
      "The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available.",
      "Kennedy was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official. He fired the previous 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a seven-member group that includes several vaccine skeptics.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps propel the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "Presentations prepared for Thursday's meeting suggest that the panel may do much the same this year. But there's also a flu-related vote that promises controversy.",
      "It concerns thimerosal, a form of mercury that\u2019s been added to vaccines since the early 20th century to preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials.",
      "Kennedy has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger. Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with limited exceptions.",
      "Thimerosal was placed on the meeting agenda shortly after Kennedy\u2019s new vaccine advisory was named last week.",
      "Before the vote, the committee will hear from Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 an antivaccine group founded by Kennedy.",
      "Some public health experts contend the thimerosal discussion will unnecessarily raise doubt in vaccines while possibly also making them more expensive and harder to get this fall.",
      "At the panel's meeting Wednesday, Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, lamented the ouster of the former ACIP panel and the agenda of the new one.",
      "Her organization, which represents large city health departments, \u201cis deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,\" she said. \"The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.\u201d",

      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded warnings about a rare heart side effect associated with the two leading COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.",
      "Myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021. Prescribing information from both Pfizer and Moderna already advises doctors about the issue.",
      "In April, the FDA sent letters to both drugmakers asking them to update and expand the warnings to add more detail about the problem and to cover a larger group of patients. While the FDA can mandate label changes, the process is often more of a negotiation with companies.",
      "Specifically, the new warning lists the risk of myocarditis as 8 cases per 1 million people who got the 2023-2024 COVID shots between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. The label also notes that the problem has been most common among males ages 12 to 24. The previous label said the problem mostly occurs in 12- to 17-year-olds.",
      "The FDA\u2019s labeling change appears to conflict with some prior findings of scientists elsewhere in the U.S. government.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously concluded there was no increased risk of myocarditis detected in government vaccine injury databases for COVID-19 shots dating back to 2022. Officials also noted that cases tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID-19 infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",
      "The FDA announcement came as new vaccine advisers appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met to debate the continuing use of COVID-19 vaccines for key groups, including pregnant women. It's the first meeting of the CDC advisory panel since Kennedy abruptly dismissed all 17 members of the group, naming a new panel that includes several members with a history of anti-vaccine statements.",
      "The FDA's label update is the latest step by officials working under Kennedy to restrict or undercut use of vaccines. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and a top deputy recently restricted annual COVID-19 shots to seniors and other Americans at higher risk from the virus. They\u2019ve also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products that require extra testing.",
      "Outside experts said the new warning is the wrong approach.",
      "\u201cThey are right to suggest that we need to consider myocarditis risks associated with the vaccine, but what they propose is exactly the wrong solution,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris, a public health specialist at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should be investigating who is prone to myocarditis to see if we can predict and mitigate that risk.\u201d",
      "Makary and several other FDA officials gained prominence during the pandemic by suggesting the federal government exaggerated the benefits of COVID-19 boosters and downplayed serious side effects, including myocarditis.",
      "Before joining the government, Makary and two of his current FDA deputies wrote a 2022 paper that said mandating booster shots in young people would cause more vaccine-related injuries than prevented hospitalizations from COVID-19 infections. The conclusion contradicted that of many leading vaccine and public health experts at the time, including at the CDC.",

      "Susan Monarez, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told senators Wednesday that she values vaccines, public health interventions and rigorous scientific evidence, but largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency, elimination of programs and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s actions to date.",
      "\u201cThe secretary is doing the important work of leading a complex agency,\u201d Monarez told members of a Senate health committee that will decide whether to advance her nomination.",
      "Monarez, 50, is the first nominee for CDC director to require Senate confirmation. She was named acting director in January and the nominee for the post in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Monarez is the former director of a federal biomedical research agency and a respected scientist, though she would be the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades.",
      "Monarez repeatedly said she had not been involved in decisions earlier this year to cut hundreds of staff and eliminate CDC programs, but that she would work to retain the agency's core functions and transition key programs to other parts of the Health and Human Services department.",
      "Her answers appeared to frustrate some senators, including Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, who said he had no questions about her qualifications.",
      "\u201cI've got questions about your willingness to follow through on your values,\u201d he said.",
      "In the two-hour hearing, Monarez was sharply questioned about Kennedy's recent move to fire all 17 members of a crucial committee that evaluates and recommends vaccines, his downplaying of the risks of measles during a nationwide outbreak and staffing cuts to a program that investigates lead poisoning in children.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, sought assurances about the scientific integrity of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by Kennedy to include vaccine skeptics.",
      "\u201cSomeone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who's reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "Monarez said she strongly supported public health interventions, including immunizations, saying, \u201cI think vaccines save lives.\"",
      "\u201cThe ACIP has a very vital role to play,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it must make sure that it is using science and evidence to drive that decision-making.\u201d",
      "She vowed to prioritize innovation, \u201cevidence-based rapid decision-making\u201d and clear communication at the $9.2 billion agency tasked with evaluating vaccines, monitoring diseases and watching for threats to Americans' health.",

      "\u201cI think he has prioritized key public health activities for preventing chronic diseases,\" she added.",
      "If Monarez is confirmed, it would end a stretch of confusion at the Atlanta-based CDC, where, for months, it wasn\u2019t clear who was running the agency. The acting director's role was filled in part by Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff who is a lawyer and political appointee with no medical experience.",
      "Monarez holds doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and her postdoctoral training was in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.",
      "At CDC headquarters in Atlanta, employees have said Monarez was rarely heard from between late January and late March, when Trump nominated her.",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisers began their first meeting Wednesday under intense scrutiny from medical experts worried about Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving shots.",
      "First on the agenda is an awkward scenario: Kennedy already announced COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women, and his new advisers aren\u2019t scheduled to vote on whether they agree. Yet government scientists prepared meeting materials calling vaccination \u201cthe best protection\u201d during pregnancy \u2014 and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.",
      "It\u2019s one signal that this week\u2019s two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn\u2019t business as usual.",
      "Another sign: Shortly before the meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist stepped down from the committee, bringing the panel's number to just seven. The Trump administration said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.",
      "The meeting opened as the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it will continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d",
      "The panel, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available, such as at pharmacies.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices. And a number of the CDC\u2019s top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.",
      "The highly unusual moves prompted a last-minute plea from a prominent Republican senator to delay this week\u2019s meeting. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the chamber's health committee, said Monday that many of Kennedy\u2019s chosen panelists lack the required expertise and \u201cmay even have a preconceived bias\u201d against new vaccine technologies.",
      "In a House hearing Tuesday, Kennedy defended his purge, saying the old panel had been \u201ca template for medical malpractice.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and Democrat from Washington state, told Kennedy: \u201cI will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet.\u201d",
      "The two-day meeting's agenda on was abruptly changed last week.",
      "Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session on Wednesday. Later in the day, the committee will take up RSV, with votes expected. On Thursday, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations and on the use of a preservative in certain flu shots.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.",
      "The committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot, but the exact language for the vote was not released prior to the meeting.",
      "\u201cI think there may be a theme of soft-pedaling or withdrawing recommendations for healthy pregnant women and healthy children,\u201d even though they are at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who co-authored a recent medical journal commentary criticizing the COVID-19 vaccination decision.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 month and older to get a flu shot, and helps greenlight the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "But given the recent changes to the committee and federal public health leadership, it's unclear how routine topics will be treated, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who has studied the committee.",
      "Thursday also promises controversy. The advisory panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism. In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Gostin said the agenda appears to be \u201ca combination of what we would normally expect ACIP to cover along with a mixture of potential conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly are in a new normal that's highly skeptical of vaccine science.\u201d",
      "The committee's recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC currently has no director, so the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy, and he has yet to act on a couple recommendations ACIP made in April.",
      "The CDC director nominee, Susan Monarez, is slated to go before a Senate committee on Wednesday.",

      "Many worry about what the future holds, and a daily grind of climate anxiety and distress can lead to sleeplessness, an inability to focus and worse. Some young people wonder whether it\u2019s moral to bring children into the world. Many people grieve for the natural world.",

      "Work locally to convince more residents to give up grass lawns and increase biodiversity with native plants, for instance. Help establish new green spaces, join projects to protect water, develop wildlife corridors, or decrease pesticide use to save frogs, insects and birds. Work to get the word out on turning down nighttime lighting to help birds and lightning bugs.",
      "\u201cI see people struggling with these emotions across the age range,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cI have parents who are themselves really struggling with their own feelings and really worried about their children in the future.\u201d",

      "The kit is full of ways to help teachers support students\u2019 mental health and manage their own climate-related emotions. One of the exercises involves students documenting their interactions with the natural world in an environmental timeline. Laying it all out often stirs action, Reid said.",

      "Global efforts to protect children against diseases like measles, polio and tuberculosis have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to deadly infections",
      "LONDON -- Efforts to vaccinate children globally have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and other diseases that can be easily prevented.",
      "Protection from measles in particular dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, unravelling decades of progress, including in rich countries that had previously eliminated the highly infectious disease, according to a new analysis of global vaccination trends published Tuesday in the journal Lancet.",
      "\u201cAfter clean water, vaccination is the most effective intervention for protecting the health of our children,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at University College London, who was not connected to the research. She warned there has been a small but worrying rise in the number of parents skipping vaccination for their children in recent years, for reasons including misinformation.",
      "In Britain, Bedford said that has resulted in the largest number of measles recorded since the 1990s and the deaths of nearly a dozen babies from whooping cough. Vaccination rates in the U.S. are also falling, and exemptions from vaccinations are at an all-time high.",
      "After the World Health Organization established its routine immunization program in 1974, countries made significant efforts to protect children against preventable and sometimes fatal diseases; the program is credited with inoculating more than 4 billion children, saving the lives of 154 million worldwide.",
      "Since the program began, the global coverage of children receiving three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine nearly doubled, from 40% to 81%. The percentage of kids getting the measles vaccine also jumped from 37% to 83%, with similar increases for polio and tuberculosis.",
      "But after the COVID-19 pandemic, coverage rates dropped, with an estimated 15.6 million children missing out on the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine and the measles vaccine. Nearly 16 million children failed to get vaccinated against polio and 9 million missed out on the TB vaccine, with the biggest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.",
      "Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who conducted the analysis, noted that more than half of the world\u2019s 15.7 million unvaccinated children live in just eight countries in 2023: Nigeria, India, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Indonesia and Brazil.",
      "Since President Trump has begun to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO and dismantled the U.S Agency for International Aid, public health experts have warned of new epidemics of infectious diseases. The researchers said it was too early to know what impact recent funding cuts might have on children's immunization rates.",
      "The WHO said there had been an 11-fold spike in measles in the Americas this year compared to 2024. Measles infections doubled in the European region in 2024 versus the previous year and the disease remains common in Africa and Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cIt is in everyone's interest that this situation is rectified,\u201d said Dr. David Elliman, a pediatrician who has advised the British government, in a statement. \u201cWhile vaccine-preventable infectious diseases occur anywhere in the world, we are all at risk.\u201d",

      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of being sued by athletes who claim a poor outcome from treatment caused them to lose future earnings.",
      "Before July 2021, when college athletes were cleared to be compensated by third parties for the use of their name, image and likeness, such lawsuits would have been virtually unwinnable.",
      "Four years later, and with schools set to share millions directly with their athletes, team physicians are wary. Some of the most high-profile college athletes are already signing multimillion-dollar deals and six-figure contracts are common.",
      "Though no malpractice lawsuits seeking lost future earnings at the college level are known to have been filed, it's only a matter of time, said Dr. James Borchers, Big Ten chief medical officer and president and CEO of the U.S. Council for Athletes\u2019 Health.",
      "\u201cThe complexity for the clinician is going to be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there are people who are going to evaluate this and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t sign up for an 18-year-old making a million dollars and then saying the decision I make affected their ability to make money.\u2019 I think you may see people say this isn\u2019t for me.\u201d",
      "The case of former Philadelphia Eagles player Chris Maragos jolted the sports medicine field in 2023 when a jury ordered his surgeon and an orthopedics group affiliated with the team to pay him $43.5 million for lost future earnings and pain and suffering after he alleged improper care of a knee injury. The orthopedics group ended its two-decade association with the Eagles out of fear of future lawsuits.",
      "At the college level, it still would be hard for an athlete to contend a team doctor's errant care cost them an opportunity to make money in professional sports because there are no guarantees to play at the next level. However, a college athlete who didn't have an optimal recovery could argue treatment reduced their ability to make NIL money or to transfer to a higher-level school where they could make more money.",
      "\u201cYou had an ACL tear, I did surgery and you never quite made it back \u2014 back in my day, you just had bad luck,\u201d said Borchers, who played football at Ohio State from 1989-93. \u201cYou\u2019re making a million dollars and that happens, you\u2019re probably having a different discussion.\u201d",
      "Borchers offered a hypothetical situation to illustrate his concerns about the pressures faced by team doctors. A receiver is treated for a hamstring injury, returns to play and reinjures the hamstring. The receiver says the injury never felt fully healed and his agent takes him to another doctor who has a different opinion on how the injury should have been treated.",
      "Borchers said the receiver would have been better off to sit out longer and miss a few more games.",
      "\u201cBut there wasn\u2019t money tied to that,\u201d he said. \"Now you could say you hurt my ability to go out and perform, so I\u2019m not going to get as much money or (it) has cost me the ability to put more tape out there so I could have transferred to a better situation and made more money. Those are the types of issues we\u2019re hearing about that used to not exist in college sports.\u201d",
      "Typically in college sports, team physicians are employed by a university-affiliated medical center or local medical group. Athletic trainers are employed by the athletic department.",
      "Team physicians must carry liability insurance either individually or through the medical center or group. The most common limits for a malpractice insurance policy are $1 million per incident and $3 million total in a year, said Mike Matray, editor of Medical Liability Monitor.",
      "\u201cYou can see how an athlete\u2019s economic damages, should a medical error end his/her career, would easily exceed those limits,\u201d Matray wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "MLM has followed the medical liability insurance industry since 1975, and though the publication does not track data specific to sports medicine practitioners who perform surgeries, Matray estimated rates for that specialty to be more than $100,000 per year in some states.",
      "Dr. Jon Divine, head team physician at Cincinnati, said Big 12 team doctors are discussing among themselves and university general counsels whether they should increase their liability insurance limits, perhaps to $2 million or $6 million or more.",
      "Divine said he and other team doctors also are taking extra steps in evaluating injuries in the new era of college sports.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve probably ordered more MRIs than I ever have in 25 years in the last two years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's to make sure we\u2019re getting it right for the (coaching) staff, for the kids, for the kid's family. There\u2019s that much more riding on it.\u201d",
      "A former Penn State football team doctor, Scott Lynch, alleged in 2019 that coach James Franklin attempted to interfere with medical decisions.",
      "A Penn State internal review found evidence of \u201cfriction\u201d between Lynch and Franklin but could not determine whether Franklin violated NCAA bylaws or Big Ten standards by interfering with medical decisions. Lynch was awarded $5.25 for wrongful termination by the hospital that had employed him.",
      "Dr. David McAllister, head team physician at UCLA who has been practicing for 27 years, said the relationship between team doctor and athlete has gone from one built on trust to now being transactional and at times adversarial.",
      "When athletes spent four or five years at the same school, as once was the norm, friendships were formed and the team doctor continued to provide care for the some athletes long after their playing days. Now, McAllister said, many football and basketball players are taking advice from agents and business managers whose priority is the athlete\u2019s earning power, and that puts pressure on team physicians.",
      "\u201cThere are seasoned, experienced people that do what I do who either recently got out of it or are really considering it because they don\u2019t want to be exposed to the liability,\u201d McAllister said, \u201cand they don\u2019t find it that much fun anymore.\u201d",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A West Virginia woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child.",
      "Miranda Guzman alleges that the state's vaccine mandate violates a 2023 West Virginia law that stipulates the government would not be able to \u201csubstantially burden\u201d someone\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of religion unless doing so \u201cis essential to further a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Guzman sued the state and local boards of education and the county schools superintendent in Raleigh County Circuit Court.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. However, the state Board of Education voted this month to direct public schools to ignore the executive order and instead follow long-standing school vaccine requirements that are laid out in state law.",
      "Also, two groups have sued over the governor's order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Guzman obtained a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate from the state health department and enrolled her child in elementary school for the 2025-26 school year. But on June 17, Guzman received an email from the Raleigh County school superintendent rescinding the certificate, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Guzman's attorneys said \u201cthe straightforward legal issue\" in the lawsuit is whether enforcement of the state vaccine mandate violates the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.",
      "West Virginia Board of Education spokesperson Christy Day referred to a June 12 statement from the board that its intent is to \u201cdo what is best\u201d for public school students, educators and school service personnel. \u201cThis includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws,\u201d the earlier statement said.",
      "A telephone message left with Raleigh County Schools Superintendent Serena Starcher wasn\u2019t immediately returned.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s school vaccination policy long has been heralded by medical experts as one of the most protective in the country for children. State law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, diphtheria, polio, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough before starting school.",
      "Morrisey, who is not a party to the lawsuit, held a news conference Tuesday in Beckley in support of Guzman.",
      "\u201cThis is not about whether or not about parents should vaccinate their children,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cThis is about standing up for religious liberty.\u201d",
      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April. The laws are modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.",

      "A Texas law promoting the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on certain foods like chips and candies",
      "DALLAS -- A new Texas law promoting the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on foods like chips and candies that contain dyes and additives not allowed in other countries.",
      "It could have far-reaching effects on the nation's food supply, but a review of the legislation shows it also misrepresents the status of some ingredients that would trigger the action.",
      "The law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday requires foods made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives to have labels starting in 2027 saying they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K. But a review shows that nearly a dozen of the targeted additives are either authorized in the cited regions \u2014 or already restricted in the U.S.",
      "The law, which will send the food industry scrambling to respond, is laudable in its intent, but could lead to incorrect citations and potential legal challenges, a consumer advocacy group said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the list of chemicals was constructed,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cWarnings have to be accurate in order to be legal.\u201d",
      "The law, approved with wide bipartisan support, is part of a flurry of similar legislation this year by GOP-led statehouses as lawmakers align themselves with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda. Texas would be the first in the U.S. to use warning labels to target additives, rather than nutrients like sugar or saturated fat, to change American diets.",
      "It will force food companies to decide whether to reformulate products to avoid the labels, add the newly required language, pull certain products from Texas shelves or oppose the measure in court.",
      "It's unclear how the list of additives was created. Inquiries to the office of the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, were not immediately returned.",
      "Regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU and the U.K. take a cautious approach to food additives: If a product's safety is uncertain, it can be banned or restricted until it is determined to be safe. By contrast, the U.S. generally allows products on the market unless there is clear risk of harm.",
      "Three additives targeted by Texas \u2014 partially hydrogenated oils, Red Dye No. 4 and Red Dye No. 3 \u2014 are not approved or have been banned in food by U.S. regulators.",
      "Several of the other listed ingredients are allowed in all four of those regions, noted Galligan and representatives from the Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group.",
      "Examples of those include: Blue Dye No. 1; Blue Dye No. 2; butylated hydroxyanisole, or BHA; butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT; diacetyl; interesterified soybean oil; lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol; and potassium aluminum sulfate.",
      "In addition, the legislation contains regulatory loopholes that could prevent certain ingredients from being labeled at all, said Melanie Benesh, an analyst with the Environmental Working Group, an activist organization that focuses on toxic chemicals.",
      "For example, the food additive azodicarbonamide, known as ADA and used as a bleaching agent in cereal flours, is included on the Texas list. But under the Federal Code of Regulations, it may safely be used in food under certain conditions. That federal regulation likely exempts ADA from the state labeling law, Benesh said.",
      "\u201cThe law, as passed, may not end up having the impact that legislators intended,\u201d Benesh said.",
      "Nutrition experts have long worried about the potential health effects of food additives, even as it remains unclear how much of a role processed foods have in driving chronic health disease.",
      "Research has shown that requiring food label warnings can help steer consumers toward healthier choices and prompt industry to remove concerning ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed front-of-package labels that would flag levels of saturated fat, sugar and sodium.",
      "\u201cThis represents a big win for Texas consumers and consumers overall,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of states not wanting to wait for the federal government to act.\u201d",
      "The law also creates a state nutrition advisory committee, boosts physical education and nutrition curriculum requirements in public and charter schools, and requires nutrition courses for college students and medical professionals doing continuing education.",
      "Several states have been taking action to restrict dyes and additives in foods.",
      "In 2023, California became the first state to ban some chemicals and dyes used in candies, drinks and other foods because of health concerns. The state expanded on that last year by barring several additional dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "Other laws passed this year include one in Arkansas banning two particular additives from food sold or manufactured in the state and a West Virginia law includes a statewide ban on seven dyes.",
      "Lawmakers in several states have passed measures this year banning certain additives from food served or sold at public schools, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. That includes Texas, where the governor last month signed a bill banning foods with certain ingredients from being served in school lunches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dizzying time to be watching what\u2019s happening, because usually policies that are not very industry friendly are opposed, particularly in red states,\" said Christina Roberto, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, \u201cWith RFK and the MAHA movement, it\u2019s really turned things upside-down in some ways.\u201d",
      "At the federal level, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary have pledged to remove artificial dyes from foods and have pressured industry to take voluntary action. Some large food manufacturers have complied.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The FDA previously has said that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",

      "Star power eclipsed fabric and form, transforming the runways of Paris Fashion Week into arenas where A-list icons, K-pop idols, and digital megastars didn\u2019t just attend \u2014 they became the main event.",
      "As the week wraps up Sunday, it\u2019s clear: the world is watching not for what\u2019s worn, but for who\u2019s wearing it.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z didn\u2019t just attend Louis Vuitton\u2019s blockbuster show \u2014 they became the story. As they swept into the Pompidou Center, the entire mood shifted. Cameras flashed. Phones shot skyward. Even before the first look hit the runway, images of the couple rocketed around the globe.",
      "The scene encapsulated a truth that every major brand \u2014 from Louis Vuitton to Dior, Herm\u00e8s to Saint Laurent \u2014 now understands: The real front row isn\u2019t in Paris, but on Instagram, TikTok and Weibo. And nothing sells quite like a star.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s head-to-toe denim look \u2014 a custom Louis Vuitton creation by Pharrell Williams \u2014 sparked headlines worldwide and instantly set the tone for the season. Her ensemble, complete with a cowboy hat and Western belt, became one of the most shared images of fashion week, underlining just how quickly a star\u2019s wardrobe can ignite trends far beyond the runway.",
      "Her Cowboy Carter tour, however, hasn't been without controversy \u2014 a T-shirt worn in Paris referencing Buffalo Soldiers drew criticism online this week from some Indigenous and Mexican communities.",
      "And when Williams presented her with a Speedy bag straight from the runway, the moment went viral \u2014 striking a powerful note that Beyonc\u00e9 isn't just an attendee, but the face of Louis Vuitton\u2019s creative vision.",
      "This is the new dynamic of luxury: The most coveted runway seat is now in your hand, and what matters most isn't just what you see, but who you see wearing it.",
      "It\u2019s a story that\u2019s been told before \u2014 celebrity eclipsing fashion \u2014 but in a year of global uncertainty, the urge for escapism and the power of star-driven fantasy have reached a new intensity.",
      "What once was a private preview for buyers and editors is now a worldwide entertainment event.",
      "Designers don\u2019t just stage shows \u2014 they produce spectacles.",

Each arrival triggered waves of posts and stories \u2014 making the crowd as newsworthy as the collection itself.",
      "The modern runway has become a stage for celebrity, where the applause is measured in views and viral moments, and the line between performer and spectator disappears.",
      "No other force is shifting menswear trends faster than K-pop. This season, stars like J-Hope, Jackson Wang, GOT7\u2019s Bambam, and NCT\u2019s Yuta were everywhere, livestreaming shows and igniting fashion frenzies from Seoul to Sao Paulo.",
      "These idols are both tastemakers and trend translators, instantly transmitting what they see in Paris to millions of fans. Their attendance has become a commercial event in itself, driving the adoption of new styles on a global scale.",
      "Even the clothes themselves now chase celebrity.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d moment and Louis Vuitton\u2019s nod to Western style sent cowboy hats, flared denim, and rhinestone shirts trending worldwide. Brands scramble to turn these viral moments into wearable trends \u2014 knowing that what Queen Bey wears in Paris will be copied in malls and on apps within weeks.",
      "\u201cWe make fashion, but we\u2019re a house of travel,\u201d Williams told reporters. In truth, it\u2019s the celebrity\u2019s journey through fashion that matters most.",
      "The old fashion cycle is gone. It's been said before. Where trends once took months to trickle down, now a celebrity-worn look can reach the high street soon after the show lights dim.",

At Herm\u00e8s, even the discreet luxury of woven leather tees and wide trousers took on new meaning as athletes and music stars documented their attendance. Their posts quickly turn exclusive details into mass-market \u201cmust-haves.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a process that global platforms like Shein and Temu have weaponized \u2014 transforming a viral runway or celebrity moment into affordable, shoppable trends in a matter of days. The result: What debuts on the Paris catwalk can show up in online shopping carts from Atlanta to Addis Ababa almost instantly.",

But even these trends go mainstream through star power, not just design. The models might debut the look, but it\u2019s the front-row faces who make it stick.",
      "Williams\u2019 very appointment as Louis Vuitton\u2019s menswear creative director \u2014 a chart-topping musician handpicked by LVMH chief Bernard Arnault in 2023 \u2014 was itself a statement: In today\u2019s industry, celebrity doesn\u2019t just influence fashion, it leads it.",
      "All this spectacle reflects a bigger shift. Fashion isn\u2019t just about what\u2019s in \u2014 it\u2019s about who\u2019s in the room, and who\u2019s watching. At Armani in Milan, at Saint Laurent in Paris, at every show, a galaxy of K-pop, Hollywood, and music stars now drive the narrative.",
      "For Gen Z and Alpha, the runway is no longer about aspiration \u2014 it\u2019s about participation, sharing, and living in the moment. The \u201cshow\u201d has become the product.",
      "In 2025, the biggest trend in men\u2019s fashion isn\u2019t a garment at all \u2014 it\u2019s the show itself. And in a season defined by heat, hype and headlines, it\u2019s clear: celebrity is the new couture, and we\u2019re all in the front row.",

      "ROME -- Major heat waves across Southern Europe have pushed temperatures above 40 C (104 F) in countries including Italy, Spain and Greece, as local authorities issued fresh warnings against the risk of wildfires.",
      "Experts link the rising frequency and intensity of these heatwaves to climate change, warning that such extreme weather events are becoming increasingly common across Europe's southern region.",

      "Pope Leo XIV is marking a feast day as the Vatican launches a new campaign to boost donations from the faithful",
      "ROME -- Pope Leo XIV on Sunday celebrated a special feast day traditionally used by the Catholic Church to drum up donations from the faithful, with the Vatican under the first American pope rolling out a new campaign to urge ordinary Catholics to help bail out the deficit-ridden Holy See.",
      "Leo celebrated Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, marking the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul and repeated his message calling for unity and communion among all Christians.",
      "In churches around the world, Masses on the July 29 feast day often include a special collection for Peter\u2019s Pence, a fund which both underwrites the operations of the central government of the Catholic Church and pays for the pope\u2019s personal acts of charity.",
      "With a promotional video, poster, QR code and website soliciting donations via credit card, PayPal, bank transfer and post office transfer, the Vatican is betting this year that an American-style fundraising pitch under the Chicago-born Leo will help keep the Holy See bureaucracy afloat and erase its 50 million to 60 million euro ($57-68 million) structural deficit.",
      "The video features footage of Leo\u2019s emotional first moments as pope, when he stepped out onto the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and later choked up as he received the fisherman\u2019s ring of the papacy. With an evocative soundtrack in the background, the video superimposes a message, available in several languages, urging donations to Leo via the Peter\u2019s Pence collection.",
      "\u201cWith your donation to Peter\u2019s Pence, you support the steps of the Holy Father,\u201d it says. \u201cHelp him proclaim the Gospel to the world and extend a hand to our brothers and sisters in need. Support the steps of Pope Leo XIV. Donate to Peter\u2019s Pence.\u201d",
      "The fund has been the source of scandal in recent years, amid revelations that the Vatican's secretariat of state mismanaged its holdings through bad investments, incompetent management and waste. The recent trial over the Vatican\u2019s bungled investment in a London property confirmed that the vast majority of Peter\u2019s Pence contributions had funded the Holy See\u2019s budgetary shortfalls, not papal charity initiatives as many parishioners had been led to believe.",
      "Between the revelations and the COVID-19 pandemic, which closed churches and canceled out the traditional pass-the-basket collection on June 29, Peter\u2019s Pence donations fell to 43.5 million euros in 2022 \u2014 a low not seen since 1986 \u2014 that was nevertheless offset the same year by other investment income and revenue to the fund.",
      "Donations rose to 48.4 million euros (about $56.7 million) in 2023 and hit 54.3 million euros (nearly $63.6 million) last year, according to the Peter\u2019s Pence annual report issued last week. But the fund incurred expenses of 75.4 million euros ($88.3 million) in 2024, continuing the trend in which the fund is exhausting itself as it covers the Holy See\u2019s budgetary shortfalls.",
      "On top of the budget deficit, the Vatican is also facing a 1 billion euro (about $1.17 billion) shortfall in its pension fund that Pope Francis, in the months before he died, warned was unable in the medium term to fulfill its obligations.",
      "Unlike countries, the Holy See doesn't issue bonds or impose income tax on its residents to run its operations, relying instead on donations, investments and revenue generated by the Vatican Museums, and sales of stamps, coins, publications and other initiatives.",
      "For years, the United States has been the greatest source of donations to Peter\u2019s Pence, with U.S. Catholics contributing around a quarter of the total each year.",
      "Vatican officials are hoping that under Leo\u2019s pontificate, with new financial controls in place and an American math major running the Holy See, donors will be reassured that their money won\u2019t be misspent or mismanaged.",
      "\u201cThis is a concrete way to support the Holy Father in his mission of service to the universal Church,\u201d the Vatican\u2019s economy ministry said in a press release last week announcing the annual collection and new promotional materials surrounding it. \u201cPeter\u2019s Pence is a gesture of communion and participation in the Pope\u2019s mission to proclaim the Gospel, promote peace, and spread Christian charity.\u201d",

      "On Saturday band members led the audience in chants of \u201cFree Palestine\u201d and \u201cFree Mo Chara.\u201d They also aimed an expletive-laden chant at U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has said he didn\u2019t think it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for Kneecap to play Glastonbury.",

      "Hong Kong's pro-democracy League of Social Democrats has disbanded under intense political pressure",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong pro-democracy political party League of Social Democrats announced on Sunday it had disbanded due to immense political pressure, the latest casualty in a years-long crackdown that has already quieted much of the city\u2019s once-vocal opposition.",
      "Following massive anti-government protests in 2019, many leading activists were prosecuted or jailed under a 2020 national security law imposed by Beijing. Dozens of civil society groups dissolved. Media outlets critical of the government shuttered.",
      "The League of Social Democrats was the only pro-democracy party that still staged small street protests from time to time and held street booth activities to carry on its advocacy despite the risks.",
      "Its chairperson, Chan Po-ying, said the disbandment decision was made after careful deliberation, especially taking into account the consequences to its members and comrades. Chan refused to elaborate on the pressure but said she was proud to say that the party had still contributed to the city's pro-democracy movement in these few years.",
      "\u201cWe have stayed true to our original aspirations and haven't let down to the trust placed in us by those who went to prison,\" she said. \u201cWhile we are now forced to disband and feel an ache in our conscience, we have no other choice,\u201d she said.",
      "Hong Kong, a former British colony, will mark the 28th anniversary of returning to Chinese rule on July 1. The city used to hold annual pro-democracy protests that day and other various demonstrations demanding better policies.",
      "But those were ceased after most organizing groups were disbanded and the leading activists were jailed. Critics say the drastic political changes under the security law reflect that the freedoms Beijing promised to keep intact in 1997 are shrinking.",
      "The Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the law is necessary for the city's stability. A Chinese official overseeing Hong Kong affairs in 2023 said protests are not the only way for people to express their views, signaling Beijing's stance toward demonstrations in the city.",
      "In April, Hong Kong\u2019s biggest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, also voted to give its leadership the mandate to move toward a potential disbandment. Party veterans told The Associated Press that some members were warned of consequences if the party didn\u2019t shut down. A final vote is expected at a later date.",
      "Founded in 2006, the League of Social Democrats was a left-wing political party that opposed collusion between government and business, upheld the principle that people have a say and was firmly committed to the interests of underprivileged residents.",
      "It was widely known for its more aggressive tactics when fighting for change. Its members have thrown bananas, eggs and luncheon meat at officials or pro-Beijing lawmakers as a protest gesture. Its party platform said the group advocated non-violent resistance but would not avoid physical confrontations \u2014 a stance that set it apart from older, traditional pro-democracy groups.",
      "It once had three lawmakers in office. Its longest-serving lawmaker, Leung Kwok-hung \u2014 Chan's husband \u2014 was disqualified from the legislature due to his manner of taking his oath in office in 2017.",
      "On the streets, the group's activism led to the arrests and jailing of its members from time to time.",
      "Last year, Leung and prominent LGBTQ+ activist Jimmy Sham, a former party leader, were sentenced to nearly seven years and more than four years over their roles in an unofficial primary election under the sweeping security law. Sham was freed from prison last month.",
      "In recent years, the party has had limited political influence, no longer holding any seats in the legislature or local district councils. Even a bank ceased to provide bank account services to the group.",
      "But it continued to stage small protests from time to time, despite sometimes those activities leading to arrests. On June 12, Chan and other members were fined after being found guilty over their street booth activities.",
      "Undeterred by their convictions, they kept pressing on and protested against the ruling outside the court.",

      "Humanoid robots have captivated fans in Beijing with a fully autonomous soccer match powered by artificial intelligence",
      "BEIJING -- While China's men's soccer team hasn't generated much excitement in recent years, humanoid robot teams have won over fans in Beijing based more on the AI technology involved than any athletic prowess shown.",
      "Four teams of humanoid robots faced off in fully autonomous 3-on-3 soccer matches powered entirely by artificial intelligence on Saturday night in China's capital in what was touted as a first in China and a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games, set to take place in Beijing.",
      "According to the organizers, a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with agility",
      "They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling. However, during the match several still had to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff, adding to the realism of the experience.",
      "China is stepping up efforts to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, using sports competitions like marathons, boxing, and football as a real-world proving ground.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offer the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots, helping to accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also emphasized safety as a core concern in the application of humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cFor example, a robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe.\u201d",
      "Booster Robotics provided the hardware for all four university teams, while each school\u2019s research team developed and embedded their own algorithms for perception, decision-making, player formations, and passing strategies\u2014including variables such as speed, force, and direction, according to Cheng.",
      "In the final match, Tsinghua University\u2019s THU Robotics defeated the China Agricultural University\u2019s Mountain Sea team with a score of 5\u20133 to win the championship.",
      "Mr. Wu, a supporter of Tsinghua, celebrated their victory while also praising the competition.",
      "\u201cThey (THU) did really well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Mountain Sea team (of Agricultural University) was also impressive. They brought a lot of surprises.\u201d",

      "A hard-right lawmaker has replaced Greece\u2019s migration and asylum minister amid a political shake-up",
      "Athens, Greece -- A hard-right lawmaker has replaced a fellow right-winger and political heavyweight accused of fraud as migration and asylum minister in Greece\u2019s government, a government spokesman announced Saturday.",
      "Thanos Plevris, 48, is succeeding Makis Voridis, 60, who resigned Friday to defend himself against allegations that he was possibly involved in an organized fraud scheme to provide farm subsidies to undeserving recipients.",
      "The European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which has investigated the case, passed on a hefty file to the Greek Parliament that includes allegations of possible involvement of government ministers. Members of Parliament enjoy immunity from prosecution in Greece that can only be lifted by parliamentary vote.",
      "In his resignation letter, Voridis denied acting illegally and said he is resigning to clear his name. He noted that during his tenure as agricultural development and foods minister from July 2019 and January 2021, he capped individual subsidies and launched a record number of investigations. His detractors say those very actions are proof that he was aware of the corrupt subsidies system and did nothing to reform it.",
      "On Friday, four other lawmakers, three of whom had formerly served as deputy ministers in the Agricultural Policy Ministry, as well as a current deputy minister, also resigned. Their replacements were also announced Saturday by government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis, who added they will be sworn in Monday.",
      "No changes are expected to be seen in Greece\u2019s tough migration policy under Plevris who, like Voridis and current health minister Adonis Georgiadis, joined the conservative New Democracy in 2012, leaving the right-populist Popular Orthodox Rally, or LAOS.",
      "Before LAOS, Voridis had been the leader of the youth wing of the far-right National Political Union, appointed to the post by jailed former dictator George Papadopoulos. He had replaced Nikos Michaloliakos, who went on to found the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party and who is currently serving a prison term for leading what courts termed a \u201ccriminal gang.\u201d",
      "Voridis founded his own far-right party, Hellenic Front, and took part in several municipal and national elections between 1994 and 2004. In 2000, he allied himself with Plevris\u2019 father Konstantinos, a lawyer, far-right activist and self-styled \u201cproud fascist.\u201d Voridis joined LAOS in 2006 and has been a lawmaker since 2007.",
      "Voridis is considered a political heavyweight and, if not for his far-right and sometimes violent past, he would have been considered a possible conservative leader, politicians and pundits agree. He now describes himself as an economic liberal and a \u201cnon-extreme\u201d nationalist.",

His main opponent in the last election was the popular entertainer known as Bobi Wine, who has also declared his candidacy in the polls set for January 2026.",
      "Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, has seen many associates jailed or go into hiding as security forces cracked down on opposition supporters.",

      "Decades ago, Museveni himself had criticized African leaders who overstayed their welcome in office. In Uganda, lawmakers did the same thing for him when they jettisoned the last constitutional obstacle \u2014 age limits \u2014 for a possible life presidency. His son, army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has asserted his wish to succeed his father, raising fears of hereditary rule.",

      "Amid battles and food insecurity across Sudan, many people are turning to weeds and wild plants to sustain them",
      "CAIRO -- With Sudan in the grips of war and millions struggling to find enough to eat, many are turning to weeds and wild plants to quiet their pangs of hunger. They boil the plants in water with salt because, simply, there is nothing else.",
      "Grateful for the lifeline it offered, a 60-year-old retired school teacher penned a love poem about a plant called Khadija Koro. It was \"a balm for us that spread through the spaces of fear,\u201d he wrote, and kept him and many others from starving.",
      "A.H, who spoke on the condition his full name not be used, because he feared retribution from the warring parties for speaking to the press, is one of 24.6 million people in Sudan facing acute food insecurity \u2014nearly half the population, according to the I ntegrated Food Security Phase Classification. Aid workers say the war spiked market prices, limited aid delivery, and shrunk agricultural lands in a country that was once a breadbasket of the world.",
      "Sudan plunged into war in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary the Rapid Support Forces escalated to fighting in the capital Khartoum and spread across the country, killing over 20,000 people, displacing nearly 13 million people, and pushing many to the brink of famine in what aid workers deemed the world\u2019s largest hunger crisis.",
      "Food insecurity is especially bad in areas in the Kordofan region, the Nuba Mountains, and Darfur, where El Fasher and Zamzam camp are inaccessible to the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Mathilde Vu, an aid worker with the group based in Port Sudan. Some people survive on just one meal a day, which is mainly millet porridge. In North Darfur, some people even sucked on coal to ease their hunger.",
      "On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the Sudanese military leader Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and asked him for a week-long ceasefire in El Fasher to allow aid delivery. Burhan agreed to that request, according to an army statement, but it\u2019s unknown whether the RSF would agree to that truce.",
      "A.H. said aid distribution often provided slight relief. His wife in children live in Obeid and also struggle to secure enough food due to high prices in the market.",
      "His poem continued: \u201cYou were a world that sends love into the barren time. You were a woman woven from threads of the sun. You were the sandalwood and the jasmine and a revelation of green, glowing and longing.\"",
      "Sudanese agricultural minister Abu Bakr al-Bashari told Al-Hadath news channel in April that there are no indicators of famine in the country, but there is shortage of food supplies in areas controlled by the paramilitary forces, known as RSF.",
      "However, Leni Kinzli, World Food Programme Sudan spokesperson, said 17 areas in Gezeira, most of the Darfur region, and Khartoum, including Jebel Aulia are at risk of famine. Each month, over 4 million people receive assistance from the group, including 1.7 million in areas facing famine or at risk, Kinzli said.",
      "The state is suffering from two conflicts: one between the Rapid Support Forces and the army, and another with the People\u2019s Liberation Movement-North, who are fighting against the army and have ties with the RSF, making it nearly impossible to access food, clean water, or medicine.",
      "He can\u2019t travel to Obeid in North Kordofan to be with his family, as the Rapid Support Forces blocked roads. Violence and looting have made travel unsafe, forcing residents to stay in their neighborhoods, limiting their access to food, aid workers said.",
      "A.H. is supposed to get a retirement pension from the government, but the process is slow, so he doesn\u2019t have a steady income. He can only transfer around $35 weekly to his family out of temporary training jobs, which he says is not enough.",
      "Hassan, another South Kordofan resident in Kadugli said that the state has turned into a \u201clarge prison for innocent citizens\u201d due to the lack of food, water, shelter, income, and primary health services caused by the RSF siege.",
      "International and grassroots organizations in the area where he lives were banned by the local government, according to Hassan, who asked to be identified only by his first name in fear of retribution for speaking publicly while being based in an area often engulfed with fighting.",
      "So residents ate the plants out of desperation.",
      "\u201cYou would groan to give life an antidote when darkness appeared to us through the window of fear.,\u201d A.H. wrote in his poem. \"You were the light, and when our tears filled up our in the eyes, you were the nectar.",
      "Vu warned that food affordability is another ongoing challenge as prices rise in the markets. A physical cash shortage prompted the Norwegian Refugee Council to replace cash assistance with vouchers. Meanwhile, authorities monopolize some markets and essential foods such as corn, wheat flour, sugar and salt are only sold through security approvals, according to Hassan.",
      "Meanwhile, in southwest Sudan, residents of Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, rely on growing crops, but agricultural lands are shrinking due to fighting and lack of farming resources.",
      "Hawaa Hussein, a woman who has been displaced in El Serif camp since 2004, told the AP that they benefit from the rainy season but they\u2019re lacking essential farming resources such as seeds and tractors to grow beans, peanuts, sesame, wheat, and weika \u2014 dried powdered okra.",
      "Hussein, a grandmother living with eight family members, said her family receives a food parcel every two months, containing lentils, salt, oil, and biscuits. Sometimes she buys items from the market with the help of community leaders.",
      "\u201cThere are many families in the camp, mine alone has five children, and so aid is not enough for everyone \u2026 you also can\u2019t eat while your neighbor is hungry and in need,\u201d she said.",
      "El Serif camp is sheltering nearly 49,000 displaced people, the camp\u2019s civic leader Abdalrahman Idris told the AP. Since the war began in 2023, the camp has taken in over 5,000 new arrivals, with a recent surge coming from the greater Khartoum region, which is the Sudanese military said it took full control of in May.",
      "\u201cThe food that reaches the camp makes up only 5% of the total need. Some people need jobs and income. People now only eat two meals, and some people can\u2019t feed their children,\u201d he said.",
      "In North Darfur, south of El Fasher, lies Zamzam camp, one of the worst areas struck by famine and recent escalating violence. An aid worker with the Emergency Response Rooms previously based in the camp who asked not to be identified in fear of retribution for speaking with the press, told the AP that the recent wave of violence killed some and left others homeless.",
      "Barely anyone was able to afford food from the market as a pound of sugar costs 20,000 Sudanese pounds ($33) and a soap bar 10,000 Sudanese pounds ($17).",
      "The recent attacks in Zamzam worsened the humanitarian situation and he had to flee to a safer area. Some elderly men, pregnant women, and children have died of starvation and the lack of medical treatment, according to an aid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he's fearful of retribution for speaking publicly while living in an area controlled by one of the warring parties. He didn't provide the exact number of those deaths.",
      "He said the situation in Zamzam camp is dire\u2014\u201cas if people were on death row.\u201d",
      "Yet A.H. finished his poem with hope:",
      "\u201cWhen people clashed and death filled the city squares\u201d A.H. wrote \u201cyou, Koro, were a symbol of life and a title of loyalty.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of protesters have gathered in Thailand\u2019s capital demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra",
      "BANGKOK -- Hundreds of protesters gathered in Thailand\u2019s capital on Saturday to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, part of the brewing political turmoil set off by a leaked phone call with former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.",
      "Paetongtarn faces growing dissatisfaction over her handling of a recent border dispute with Cambodia involving an armed confrontation May 28. One Cambodian soldier was killed in a relatively small, contested area. The clash set off a string of investigations that could lead to her removal.",
      "Protesters held national flags and signs as they occupied parts of the streets around the Victory Monument in central Bangkok. A huge stage was set up at the foot of the monument as participants sat and listened to speakers who said they gathered to express their love of the country following the intensified border row.",
      "Many of the leading figures in the protest were familiar faces who were part of a group popularly known as Yellow Shirts, whose clothing color indicates loyalty to the Thai monarchy. They are longtime foes of Paetongtarn\u2019s father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.",
      "Their rallies at times turned violent and led to military coups in 2006 and 2014, which respectively ousted the elected governments of Thaksin and Paetongtarn\u2019s aunt, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.",
      "Outrage over the recorded phone call mostly revolved around Paetongtarn telling Hun Sen, the current Cambodian Senate president and a longtime friend of her father, not to listen to \u201can opponent\u201d in Thailand. It\u2019s believed to be a reference to the regional Thai army commander in charge of the area where the clash happened, who publicly criticized Cambodia over the border dispute.",
      "Hun Sen on Saturday vowed to protect his country\u2019s territory from foreign invaders and condemned what he called an attack by Thai forces last month.",
      "At a 74th anniversary celebration of the foundation of his long-ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party, Hun Sen claimed the action by the Thai army was illegal when it engaged Cambodian forces. He said the skirmish inside Cambodian territory was a serious violation of country\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, despite Cambodia's good will in attempting to resolve the border issue.",
      "\u201cThis poor Cambodia has suffered from foreign invasion, war, and genocide, been surrounded and isolated and insulted in the past but now Cambodia has risen on an equal face with other countries. We need peace, friendship, cooperation, and development the most, and we have no politics and no unfriendly stance with any nation,\u201d Hun Sen said in front of cheerful thousands of party members at the event in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh.",
      "There is a long history of territorial disputes between the countries. Thailand is still rattled by a 1962 International Court of Justice ruling that awarded Cambodia the disputed territory where the historic Preah Vihear temple stands. There were sporadic though serious clashes there in 2011. The ruling from the U.N. court was reaffirmed in 2013, when Yingluck was prime minister.",
      "The scandal has broken Paetongtarn's fragile coalition government, costing her Pheu Thai Party the loss of its biggest partner, Bhumjaithai Party. There already was a rift between Bhumjaithai and Pheu Thai Party over reports Bhumjaithai would be shuffled out of the powerful Interior Ministry.",
      "Several Bhumjaithai leaders also are under investigation over an alleged rigging of last year's Senate election in which many figures who are reportedly close to the party claimed a majority of seats.",
      "The departure of Bhumjaithai left the 10-party coalition with 255 seats, just above the majority of the 500-seat house.",
      "Paetongtarn also faces investigations by the Constitutional Court and the national anti-corruption agency. Their decisions could lead to her removal from office.",
      "Sarote Phuengrampan, secretary-general of the Office of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, said Wednesday that his agency is investigating Paetongtarn for a serious breach of ethics over the phone call with Hun Sen. He did not give a possible timeline for a decision.",
      "Reports said the Constitutional Court can suspend Paetongtarn from duty pending the investigation and could decide as early as next week whether it will take the case. The prime minister said Tuesday she is not worried and is ready to give evidence to support her case.",
      "\u201cIt was clear from the phone call that I had nothing to gain from it, and I also didn\u2019t cause any damage to the country,\u201d she said.",
      "The court last year removed her predecessor from Pheu Thai over a breach of ethics. Thailand\u2019s courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are considered a bulwark of the country\u2019s royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent state agencies such as the Election Commission to cripple or sink political opponents.",

      "\u201cF1 The Movie\u201d debuted with $55.6 million in North American theaters and $144 million globally over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, handing the tech company easily its biggest opening yet.",
      "Though Apple Original Films has had some notable successes in its six years in Hollywood \u2014 including the 2021 Oscar-winner \u201cCODA\u201d \u2014 its theatrical results have been decidedly mixed. Misfires like \u201cArgylle\u201d and \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d and big-budget awards plays like Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d and Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d have been better at driving viewers to Apple TV+ than movie theaters.",
      "But \u201cF1\u201d was Apple\u2019s first foray into summer blockbuster territory. It won a bidding war for the project from much of the production team behind the 2022 box-office smash \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d Apple then partnered with Warner Bros. to distributed the film starring Brad Pitt, Damson Idris and Kerry Condon.",
      "With a production budget over $200 million, \u201cF1\u201d still has several laps to go to turn a profit. But for now, \u201cF1\u201d is full speed ahead.",
      "\"The film\u2019s outstanding debut reflects both the excitement of Formula 1 and the deeply emotional and entertaining story crafted by the entire cast and creative team,\" said Zack Van Amburg, who heads worldwide video for Apple with Jamie Erlicht. \"Their dedication and innovation have fueled an unforgettable cinematic experience.\u201d",
      "Car racing movies have often struggled in theaters; crash-and-burn cases include Ron Howard\u2019s \u201cRush\u201d (2013) and Michael Mann\u2019s \u201cFerrari\u201d (2023). But \u201cF1\u201d built off the Formula 1 fandom stirred up by the popular series \u201cFormula 1: Drive to Survive.\u201d And it leaned on \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer to deliver another adult-oriented action thrill ride.",
      "As in \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d the filmmakers sought an adrenaline rush by placing IMAX cameras inside the cockpit in \u201cF1.\u201d IMAX and large-format screens accounted for 55% of in its ticket sales. IMAX, whose screens are much sought-after in the summer, has carved out a three-week run for the movie.",
      "Warner Bros. expected \u201cF1\u201d to perform well overseas, where the sport is more popular than it is in the U.S. Jeffrey Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros., said Pitt was the movie's \u201csecret sauce.\u201d The $144 million global launch is the actor's biggest opening weekend.",
      "\u201cWe came up with multiple campaigns based on where you are in the world,\u201d said Goldstein. \u201cWe planned for an audience-winner: screen the movie and get it out there. People talking about this movie drove this movie.\u201d",
      "Reviews have been very good for \u201cF1\u201d and audience reaction (an \u201cA\u201d via CinemaScore) was even better.

      "Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, praised Warner Bros. for making \u201cF1\u201d a theatrical event. The studio was also behind the year's other big original release, \u201cSinners.\"",

      "The largest tranche is going to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.",
      "NEW YORK -- Famed investor Warren Buffett is donating $6 billion worth of his company's stock to five foundations, bringing the total he has given to them since 2006 to roughly $60 billion, based on their value when received.",
      "Buffett said late Friday that the shares of Berkshire Hathaway will be delivered on Monday. Berkshire Hathaway owns Geico, Dairy Queen and a range of other businesses, and Buffett is donating nearly 12.4 million of the Class B shares of its stock. Those shares have a lower and easier-to-digest price tag than the company's original Class A shares, and each of the B shares was worth $485.68 at their most recent close on Friday.",

      "WASHINGTON -- At some 940-pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. Now it's up to Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump's signature's domestic policy package will become law.",
      "Trump told Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.",
      "Senators were working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it.",
      "Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as lawmakers negotiate.",
      "Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.",
      "It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount.",
      "A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.",
      "There are scores of business-related tax cuts.",
      "The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.",
      "Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.",
      "The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.",
      "The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.",
      "For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.",
      "To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It's essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.",
      "Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program\u2019s work requirements.",
      "There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.",
      "Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.",
      "All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.",
      "The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Fund to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.",

      "The Senate is expected to grind through a rare weekend session as Republicans race to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s package of tax breaks and spending cuts by his July Fourth deadline",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to grind through a rare weekend session as Republicans race to pass President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks and spending cuts by his July Fourth deadline.",
      "Republicans are using their majorities in Congress to push aside Democratic opposition, but they have run into a series of political and policy setbacks. Not all GOP lawmakers are on board with proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid, food stamps and other programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8 trillion in Trump tax breaks.",
      "The 940-page bill was released shortly before midnight Friday. Senators were expected to take a procedural vote Saturday to begin debate on the legislation, but the timing was uncertain and there is a long path ahead, with at least 10 hours of debate time and an all-night voting session on countless amendments.",
      "Senate passage could be days away, and the bill would need to return to the House for a final round of votes before it could reach the White House.",
      "\u201cIt's evolving,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., as he prepared to close up the chamber late Friday.",
      "The weekend session could be a make-or-break moment for Trump's party, which has invested much of its political capital on his signature domestic policy plan. Trump is pushing Congress to wrap it up, even as he sometimes gives mixed signals, allowing for more time.",
      "At recent events at the White House, including Friday, Trump has admonished the \u201cgrandstanders\u201d among GOP holdouts to fall in line.",
      "\u201cWe can get it done,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cIt will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country.\u201d",
      "The legislation is an ambitious but complicated series of GOP priorities. At its core, it would make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire by year's end if Congress fails to act, resulting in a potential tax increase on Americans. The bill would add new breaks, including no taxes on tips, and commit $350 billion to national security, including for Trump's mass deportation agenda.",
      "But the spending cuts that Republicans are relying on to offset the lost tax revenues are causing dissent within the GOP ranks. Some lawmakers say the cuts go too far, particularly for people receiving health care through Medicaid. Meanwhile, conservatives, worried about the nation's debt, are pushing for steeper cuts.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he is concerned about the fundamentals of the package and will not support the procedural motion to begin debate.",
      "\u201cI'm voting no on the motion to proceed,\u201d he said.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pushing for deeper cuts, said he needed to see the final legislative text.",
      "The release of that draft had been delayed as the Senate parliamentarian reviewed the bill to ensure it complied with the chamber\u2019s strict \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. It largely bars policy matters from inclusion in budget bills unless a provision can get 60 votes to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate with a 53-47 GOP edge and Democrats unified against Trump\u2019s bill.",
      "Republicans suffered a series of setbacks after several proposals were determined to be out of compliance by the chief arbiter of the Senate's rules. One plan would have shifted some food stamp costs from the federal government to the states; a second would have gutted the funding structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "But over the past days, Republicans have quickly revised those proposals and reinstated them.",
      "The final text includes a proposal for cuts to a Medicaid provider tax that had run into parliamentary objections and opposition from several senators worried about the fate of rural hospitals. The new version extends the start date for those cuts and establishes a $25 billion fund to aid rural hospitals and providers.",
      "Most states impose the provider tax as a way to boost federal Medicaid reimbursements. Some Republicans argue that is a scam and should be abolished.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that under the House-passed version of the bill, some 10.9 million more people would go without health care and at least 3 million fewer would qualify for food aid. The CBO has not yet publicly assessed the Senate draft, which proposes steeper reductions.",
      "Top income-earners would see about a $12,000 tax cut under the House bill, while the poorest Americans would face a $1,600 tax increase, the CBO said.",
      "One unresolved issue remains the so-called SALT provision, a deduction for state and local taxes that has been a top priority of lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states. The cap is now $10,000.",
      "The White House and House Republicans had narrowed in on a plan for a $40,000 cap, but for five years instead of 10. Republican senators says that's too generous. At least one House GOP holdout, Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, said he cannot support the compromise.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans are rushing to finish the bill before the public fully knows what\u2019s in it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no good reason for Republicans to chase a silly deadline,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who sent his colleagues home for the weekend with plans to be on call to return to Washington, said they are \u201cvery close\u201d to finishing up.",
      "\u201cWe would still like to meet that July Fourth, self-imposed deadline,\u201d said Johnson, R-La.",

      "It\u2019s been illegal to smoke in restaurants, bars and public buildings since a series of bans in 2007 and 2008. Ever-higher taxes mean a pack now costs upwards of 12 euros ($14).",
      "Yet more than 30% of French adults still smoke cigarettes, most of them daily, one of the higher rates in Europe and globally. The Health Ministry is particularly concerned that tobacco remains popular among young people, citing public health statistics showing that 15% of 17-year-olds smoke. Black market cigarette trading is common.",
      "More than 200 people in France die each day of tobacco-related illness, Health Minister Catherine Vautrin said in a statement Saturday. That adds up to some 75,000 deaths per year.",
      "In a Paris park as the ban loomed, views were mixed.",
      "Parisian Natacha Uzan welcomed the end of smoking in restaurants. But she said: \u2019\u2019Now outside, in parks, I find it becoming a bit repressive.\u201d",
      "The broader ban is a \u2018\u2019good thing'' for Anabelle Cermell, mother of a 3-month-old boy. \u2018\u2019I tell myself, oh, it\u2019s really not ideal for him, but there\u2019s not much I can do about it, or I would have to ... not take the bus, not go to parks.\u201d",
      "The government said last month that the new ban would take effect July 1. The official decree introducing the ban was published Saturday, and a health minister\u2019s statement said that a government order specifying the perimeters set by the ban would be published in the coming days.",
      "Electronic cigarettes are exempt from the new ban.",
      "Other European countries have gone farther. Britain and Sweden have tightened smoking regulations in public spaces. Spain is extending its smoking ban to caf\u00e9 and restaurant terraces, which are exempt from France\u2019s new ban.",

      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed legislation Friday that funds up to $500 million in renovations to Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
      "The bill, which won bipartisan support in both of the state's GOP-controlled chambers, will use sales tax revenue from the stadium and nearby buildings for infrastructure upgrades over the next 30 years, including improvements to air conditioning systems and the stadium\u2019s retractable roof.",
      "The team said it will also contribute $250 million for the renovations at the stadium, which is located in downtown Phoenix and is surrounded by small businesses and restaurants that see a boost of activity during the baseball season.",
      "The legislation is one of a handful of bipartisan deals that Hobbs, a Democrat, prioritized negotiating during the session. She says the funding is a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, will provide good-paying jobs and ensure the Diamondbacks do not leave Phoenix.",
      "Attendance at games has increased since the team's 2023 run to the World Series, where the Diamondbacks lost to the Texas Rangers. This season they are averaging 31,420 fans per game \u2014 the highest in two decades.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to let Arizona lose the Diamondbacks,\u201d Hobbs said Friday on the social platform X.",

      "Other MLB teams have threatened to leave host cities if they did not get public financing.",

Now the team is bound for Las Vegas, where a groundbreaking ceremony was held this month for a $1.75 billion ballpark that is expected to be completed in time for the 2028 season. Nevada and Clark County approved up to $380 million in public funds for the project.",
      "And last year voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected an attempt to extend a sales tax that would have helped fund a ballpark for the Kansas City Royals and stadium renovations for the Kansas City Chiefs. Lawmakers in Kansas are trying to lure the teams with government subsidies, and Missouri is trying to keep them with its own financial incentives.",
      "The Diamondbacks have spent nearly three decades in their downtown ballpark, which is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District. In 2017, the team sued the district over funding for repairs and sought to remove a contractual clause preventing the team from looking into other stadium options.",
      "A perennial problem has been the park's air conditioning system and its ability to keep it cool in triple-digit summer heat, Hall said. Fans of country music star Morgan Wallen bemoaned the heat at a concert there last July, despite the retractable roof being closed. Concession stands ran out of water, and some people simply left.",
      "Chase Field was one of the first MLB stadiums to have a retractable roof. Now seven out of the 30 teams play under one, including the Brewers, Blue Jays, Rangers, Marlins, Astros and Mariners. Chase Field also has a small swimming pool in right field, one of its most recognizable features.",
      "The funding from the Legislature will not mean upgrades to the pool or to stadium suites, the latter of which was a sticking point for Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. She got on board after the bill was updated to prevent funds from being used for suites and a cap was placed on how much money the city would contribute for a land deal should the Diamondbacks break from the Stadium District, according to Gallego chief of staff Seth Scott.",
      "Hobbs is running for reelection, and while it's too early to say whether the Diamondbacks funding will be part of her campaign messaging, it's another bipartisan win, her communications director Michael Beyer said.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Mitzi Epstein, who voted against the funding, said Hobbs' support for the bill was wrong and hurtful for Arizonans. She said she was disappointed that amendments to create public benefits such as free streaming of games failed.",

      "Starlink\u2019s lightweight, high-speed internet system has rapidly spread across the Amazon, a region that for decades struggled with slow and unreliable connectivity. But the service has also been adopted by criminal organizations, which have used it to coordinate logistics, make payments and receive alerts about police raids.",
      "It's the first agreement of its kind aimed at curbing such use following years of pressure from Brazilian authorities.",
      "Starlink, a division of Musk's SpaceX, will begin requiring identification and proof of residence from all new users in Brazil\u2019s Amazon region starting in January. The company will also provide Brazilian authorities with user registration and geolocation data for internet units located in areas under investigation.",
      "If a terminal is confirmed to be used for illegal activity, Starlink has committed to blocking the service. The deal is for two years and can be renewed.",
      "Illegal gold mining has contaminated hundreds of miles of Amazon rivers with mercury and disrupted the traditional lives of several Indigenous tribes, including the Yanomami. Starlink, which first arrived in the region in 2022, has enabled criminal groups to manage mining operations in remote areas, where logistics are complex and equipment and fuel must be transported by small plane or boat.",

With the agreement, connectivity in remote areas also becomes a tool for environmental responsibility and respect for sovereignty,\u201d federal prosecutor Andr\u00e9 Porreca said in a statement.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The United States and China have reached an agreement \u2014 again \u2014 to deescalate trade tensions. But details are scarce, and the latest pact leaves major issues between the world's two biggest economies unresolved.",
      "President Donald Trump said late Thursday that a deal with China had been signed \"the other day.'' China's Commerce Ministry confirmed Friday that some type of arrangement had been reached but offered few details about it.",
      "Sudden shifts and a lack of clarity have been hallmarks of Trump's trade policy since he returned to the White House determined to overturn a global trading system that he says is unfair to the United States and its workers.",
      "He's been engaged for months in a battle with China that has mostly revealed how much pain the two countries can inflict on each other. And he's racing against a July 8 deadline to reach deals with other major U.S. trading partners.",
      "The uncertainty over his dealmaking and the cost of the tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers and usually passed on to consumers, have raised worries about the outlook for the U.S. economy. And although analysts welcomed the apparent easing of tensions with China, they also warned that the issues dividing Washington and Beijing are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday that the Chinese had agreed to make it easier for American firms to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals critical for manufacturing and microchip production. Beijing had slowed exports of the materials amid a bitter trade dispute with the Trump administration.",
      "Without explicitly mentioning U.S. access to rare earths, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said that \u201cChina will, in accordance with the law, review and approve eligible export applications for controlled items. In turn, the United States will lift a series of restrictive measures it had imposed on China.''",
      "The Chinese have complained about U.S. controls on exports of advanced U.S. technology to China. But the ministry statement did not specifically say whether the United States planned to ease or lift those controls.",
      "In his interview on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria,\u201d Bessent mentioned that the United States had earlier imposed \u201ccountermeasures'' against China and \u201dhad held back some vital supplies for them.''",
      "\"What we\u2019re seeing here is a de-escalation under President Trump\u2019s leadership,'' Bessent said, without spelling out what concessions the United States had made or whether they involved America's export controls.",
      "Jeff Moon, a trade official in the Obama administration who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy, wondered why Trump hadn\u2019t disclosed details of the agreement two days after it had been reached.",
      "\u201cSilence regarding the terms suggests that there is less substance to the deal than the Trump Administration implies,\u2033 said Moon, who also served as a diplomat in China.",
      "The agreement that emerged Thursday and Friday builds on a \"framework'' that Trump announced June 11 after two days of high-level U.S.-China talks in London. Then, he announced, China had agreed to ease restrictions on rare earths. In return, the United States said it would stop seeking to revoke the visas of Chinese students on U.S. college campuses.",
      "And last month, after another meeting in Geneva, the two countries had agreed to dramatically reduce massive taxes they'd slapped on each other's products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S.",
      "Those triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China and caused a frightening sell-off in financial markets. In Geneva, the two countries agreed to back off and keep talking: America\u2019s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China\u2019s to 10%. That led to the talks in London earlier this month and to this week's announcement.",
      "If nothing else, the two countries are trying to ratchet down tensions after demonstrating how much they can hurt each other.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. and China appear to be easing the chokeholds they had on each other\u2019s economies through export controls on computer chips and rare earth minerals, respectively,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \"This is a positive step but a far cry from signaling prospects of a substantial de-escalation of tariffs and other trade hostilities.''",
      "Trump launched a trade war with China in his first term, imposing tariffs on most Chinese goods in a dispute over China's attempts to supplant U.S. technological supremacy. Trump's trade team charged that China was unfairly subsidizing its own tech companies, forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over sensitive technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market and even engaging outright theft of trade secrets.",
      "The squabbling and negotiating of the past few months appear to have done little to resolve Washington's complaints about unfair Chinese trade practices and America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $262 billion last year.",
      "This week's agreement \u201cincludes absolutely nothing related to the U.S.\u2019s concerns regarding China\u2019s trade surplus or non-market behavior,'' said Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201dIf the two sides can implement these elements of the ceasefire, then they could begin negotiations on issues which generated the initial escalation in tensions in the first place.''",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has made aggressive use of tariffs. In addition to his levies on China, he has imposed \"baseline'' 10% taxes on imports from every country in the world . And he's announced even higher taxes \u2014 so-called reciprocal tariffs ranging from 11% to 50% \u2014 on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit.",
      "But after financial markets sank on fears of massive disruption to world trade, Trump suspended the reciprocal levies for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate reductions in their barriers to U.S. exports. That pause lasts until July 8.",
      "On Friday, Bessent told Fox Business Network that the talks could extend beyond the deadline and be \u201cwrapped up by Labor Day\u2019\u2019 Sept. 1 with 10 to 12 of America's most important trading partners.",
      "Trump further played down the July 8 deadline at a White House press conference Friday by noting that negotiations are ongoing but that \u201cwe have 200 countries, you could say 200 countries-plus. You can't do that.\u201d",
      "Instead of new trade deals, Trump said his administration would in coming days or weeks send out a letter where \u201cwe're just gonna tell them what they have to pay to do business in the United States.''",
      "Separately, Trump took sudden aim at Canada Friday, saying on social media that he's immediately suspending trade talks with that country over its plan to impose a tax on technology firms next Monday. Trump called Canada's digital services tax \u201ca direct and blatant attack on our country.\u201d",
      "The digital services tax will hit companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It will apply retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion bill due at the end of the month.",

      "The Federal Reserve said all major banks passed this year\u2019s stress tests, showing they can withstand a hypothetical severe economic downturn",
      "NEW YORK -- All the major banks passed the Federal Reserve's annual \u201cstress tests\" of the financial system, the central bank said Friday, but the test conducted by the central bank was notably less vigorous than it had been in previous years.",
      "All 22 banks tested this year would have remained solvent and above the minimum thresholds to continue to operate, the Fed said, despite absorbing roughly $550 billion in theoretical losses. In the Fed's scenario, there would be less of a rise in unemployment, less of a severe economic contraction, less of a drop in commercial real estate prices, less of a drop in housing prices, among other metrics compared to what they tested in 2024.",
      "All of these less harmful, but simulated, drops mean there would be less damage to these banks' balance sheets and less risk of these banks of potentially failing. Since the banks passed the 2024 tests, it was expected that the banks would pass the 2025 tests.",
      "\u201cLarge banks remain well capitalized and resilient to a range of severe outcomes,\u201d said Michelle Bowman, the bank's vice chair for supervision, in a statement. An appointee of President Trump, Bowman became the Fed's vice chair of supervision earlier this month.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why the Fed chose to go with a less vigorous test this year. In a statement, the bank said previous tests had shown \u201cunintended volatility\u201d in the results and it plans to seek public and industry comment to adjust stress tests in future years. The Fed also chose to not test the banks as heavily on their exposure to private equity assets, arguing that private equity assets are typically held for the long term and are not typically sold at times of distress.",
      "The Fed also didn\u2019t test for any bank exposure to private credit, a $2 trillion asset class that even Fed researchers themselves have observed to be growing alarmingly quickly. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston recently pointed out that private credit could be a systemic risk to the financial system under a severe adverse scenario, which is exactly what the stress tests are supposed to test for.",
      "There was no wording or phrasing in the Fed's press release, reports or methodology about testing or measuring private credit or private debt in this year's test.",
      "The Fed's \u201cstress tests\u201d were created after the 2008 financial crisis as a way to gauge whether the nation's \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks could withstand another financial crisis like the once that happened nearly 20 years ago. The tests are effectively an academic exercise, where the Fed simulates a scenario in the global economy and measures what that scenario would do to bank balance sheets.",
      "The 22 banks that are tested are the biggest names in the business, such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and have wide-ranging businesses that touch every part of the U.S. and global economy.",
      "Under this year's hypothetical scenario, a major global recession would have caused a 30% decline in commercial real estate prices and a 33% decline in housing prices. The unemployment rate would rise to 10% and stock prices would fall 50%. In 2024, the hypothetical scenario was a 40% decline in commercial real estate prices, a 55% decline in stock prices and a 36% decline in housing prices.",
      "With their passing grades, the major banks will be allowed to issue dividends to shareholders and buy back shares of stock to return proceeds to investors. Those dividend plans will be announced next week.",

      "Orrville, Ohio-based Smucker said Thursday it will also remove synthetic dyes from foods sold to K-12 schools by the 2026-2027 school year.",
      "Smucker said the majority of its products \u2013 including its Uncrustables sandwiches \u2013 are already free of synthetic dyes. But some products still have them, including sugar-free jams and ice cream toppings.",
      "Smucker said some products from Hostess, which it acquired in 2023, also contain artificial colors. Twinkies are made with Red 40 and Yellow 5, for example, while Snoballs snack cakes are made with Red 40 Lake, a dye combined with aluminum to keep it from dissolving in water.",
      "Smucker joins a growing number of big food companies that have announced plans to eliminate artificial dyes. Earlier this week, Nestle and Conagra Brands \u2014 the parent company of Duncan Hines \u2014 both said they would phase out synthetic dyes. Kraft Heinz and General Mills made similar pledges last week.",
      "The federal government has stepped up its scrutiny of artificial colors in recent months. In January, days before President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation\u2019s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Trump\u2019s Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",

      "A California judge has ruled the state's bare-bones home insurance program's handling of smoke damage claims is unlawful, a decision that could have wide-ranging implications as insurers increasingly deal with the aftermath of wildfires.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don\u2019t torch the property. The decision Tuesday by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stuart M. Rice is a victory for homeowners in a state where the risk of catastrophic wildfires has intensified alongside a brewing home insurance crisis.",
      "The specific case involved Jay Aliff, who sued in 2021 over the insurance payout for his house near Lake Tahoe, which was damaged in the November 2020 Mountain View fire. His lawsuit challenged the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or the FAIR Plan, the state\u2019s high-risk insurance pool or the last-resort option for those dropped by private insurance companies.",
      "With high premiums and basic coverage, the FAIR Plan was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders could find a more permanent option. Today, it has become the default option for many, with the number of residential policies reaching 550,000 in March, more than double from 2020, state data shows.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven\u2019t standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "The FAIR Plan has been scrutinized for years over allegations of summarily denying smoke damage claims unless there\u2019s proof of permanent physical change, even though the California Department of Insurance has long determined that that threshold is illegal.",
      "Aliff's lawsuit claims that FAIR Plan at the time offered a fraction of the money he expected to cover the costs to remediate the damages, citing a partial denial letter that said the fire debris could be cleaned up \u2013- and therefore didn\u2019t qualify for coverage as a \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to the home.",
      "\u201cThe things that burn are terrifying like lead, cyanide. It\u2019s not possible to get that out with Swiffer,\u201d said Aliff\u2019s attorney, Dylan Schaffer, referring to the brand of disposable mops.",
      "Schaffer, who is also the attorney in a number of other lawsuits against the FAIR Plan related to the smoke damage issue, said the new court ruling was a game-changer in California insurance law at a time when thousands of homeowners in the recent Palisades and Eaton wildfires are still fighting for coverage.",
      "\u201cIt is the most important decision in California insurance law in decades,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cIt draws a line in the sand as it relates to where carriers can start carving out their liability and avoiding liability.\u201d",
      "The ruling said the way the FAIR Plan limits smoke damage coverage to its definition of \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d was a violation of the law, stating that \u201cthis language limits coverage reasonably expected by an insured in a manner which is not conspicuous, plain and clear.\u201d",
      "The judge also said it was unlawful that the FAIR Plan required smoke damage to be \u201cvisible to the unaided human eye\u201d or capable of being \u201cdetected by the unaided human nose of an average person\u201d rather than \"the subjective senses of (the insured) or by laboratory testing.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing unable to resort to their own senses or laboratory tests, it is entirely unclear how an insured could determine whether a particular loss is covered or not,\u201d the court decision noted.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean said in a statement that the insurer has been working with the state insurance agency to update its policy language and has already eliminated the so-called sight and smell test.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to continue providing fair and reasonable coverage for wildfire-related losses while maintaining the financial integrity of the FAIR Plan for all policyholders,\" McLean said in a statement.",

      "Republican efforts to loosen regulations on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns have been dealt a big setback",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republican efforts to loosen regulations on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns have been dealt a big setback with the Senate parliamentarian advising that the proposal would need to clear a 60-vote threshold if included in their big tax and immigration bill.",
      "Gun rights groups had been lobbying aggressively for the measure, which would essentially treat silencers and the short-barreled firearms like long guns. Gun-control groups celebrated the parliamentarian's ruling, saying the items have been regulated for nearly 100 years for good reason \u2014 they are a threat to first responders and communities.",
      "The House version of the GOP's bill removed silencers \u2014 called \u201csuppressors\u201d by the gun industry \u2014 from a 1930s law that regulates firearms considered the most dangerous, and in the process, would have eliminated a $200 tax. The Senate kept the provision on silencers in its version of the bill and expanded upon it, adding short-barreled, or sawed-off, rifles and shotguns.",
      "Under the National Firearms Act, potential buyers of the regulated weapons must also undergo a finger-print based background check. There is no deadline for such checks. The process is arguably more thorough than the name-based background check completed for other firearms purchases.",
      "Lawmakers said the silencers provision was deemed by the Senate parliamentarian to be in violation of the \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d which stipulates that the budget changes sought in the legislation cannot be \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to the policy changes. The special rules are designed to deter provisions unrelated to spending or taxes from being included in the bill.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Republicans will jump at any opportunity to please the gun lobby by rolling back gun safety measures, but that kind of policy does not belong in a reconciliation bill,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.",
      "Gun rights groups complained about the $200 tax and how the background check process often takes weeks and even months for silencers and short-barreled weapons.",
      "Larry Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who supports the legislation, said before the ruling that the proposed changes were aimed at helping target shooters and hunters protect their hearing. He argued that the use of silencers in violent crimes is rare. \u201cAll it\u2019s ever intended to do is to reduce the report of the firearm to hearing safe levels,\u201d Keane said.",
      "John Commerford, executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action, disagreed with the parliamentarian's ruling, noting that she was originally appointed by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat.",
      "\u201cNevertheless, we remain committed to working with our allies on Capitol Hill to end the unjust tax burden on these constitutionally-protected arms,\u201d Commerford said.",
      "Groups opposed to the measure included Giffords, the gun violence prevention organization co-founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords who was grievously wounded in a 2011 mass shooting in her district.",
      "Emma Brown, the group's executive director said \u201cremoving safeguards on gun silencers would have made it easier for violent criminals to escape, putting both law enforcement and civilians at greater risk.\u201d",
      "\"What\u2019s more, removing safeguards on short barreled firearms would have only enabled more criminals to access these easily concealable weapons, which can be easily brought into large crowds,\u201d Brown said.",
      "The gun language had broad support among Republicans and has received little attention as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., work to settle differences within the party on cuts to Medicaid and energy tax credits, among other issues.",
      "It is just one of hundreds of policy and spending items that were included to entice members to vote for the legislation and will have broad implications in the years to come.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A key inflation gauge moved higher in May in the latest sign that prices remain stubbornly elevated while Americans cut back on their spending.",
      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, an increase from 2.5% the previous month. Both figures are modestly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.",
      "At the same time, Americans cut back on spending for the first time since January, as overall spending fell 0.1%.",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Donald Trump\u2019s broad-based tariffsare still having only a modest effect on prices. The costs of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares, and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month\u2019s 0.1%.",
      "The weakness in spending in part likely reflects reduced purchases of cars and other manufactured goods after Americans stepped up their spending on those items this spring to get ahead of tariffs.",

But its statement did not explicit mention an agreement to ensure U.S. access to rare earths, materials used in high-tech applications that have been at the center of negotiations.",
      "\u201cChina will approve the export applications of controlled items that meet the conditions in accordance with the law. The United States will cancel a series of restrictive measures taken against China accordingly. It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. In early European trading, Germany\u2019s DAX added 0.8% to 23,847.16. In Paris, the CAC 40 surged 1.3% to 7,656.55. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 0.5% to 8,779.78.",
      "The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2%.",
      "Markets have settled somewhat after the upheavals of the Israel-Iran war and its aftermath.",
      "Worries about Trump\u2019s higher tariffs have receded since the president shocked the world in April with stiff proposed levies, but they have not disappeared. The wait is still on to see how big the tariffs will ultimately be, how much they will hurt the economy and how much they will push up inflation.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index lost 0.2% to 24,284.15, while the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.7% to 3,424.23 after China reported that industrial profits slid 9.1% in May, the sharpest drop since last October.",
      "\u201cBeijing may have paused the worst of the trade fight with Washington, but the tariff scars are showing\u2014and unless demand picks up or pricing stabilizes, the pressure on margins and business sentiment will linger,\u201d Stephen Innes, Managing Partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary.",

      "On Thursday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.8% and at 6,141.02 was sitting just 0.05% below its all-time closing high set in February. The index at the heart of many 401(k) accounts had dropped roughly 20% below its record during the spring on worries about Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.9% and the Nasdaq composite gained 1%.",
      "Reports on Thursday added to evidence the U.S. economy is holding up despite higher tariffs and other challenges, though it has slowed. Orders for washing machines and other manufactured goods that last at least three years grew by more last month than economists expected. Another report said fewer U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, a potential signal of fewer layoffs.",
      "A third report said the U.S. economy shrank by more during the first three months of 2025 than earlier estimated. But many economists say those numbers were distorted by a surge in imports as companies tried to get ahead of tariffs. They\u2019re expecting a better performance in upcoming months.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell to its lowest level since early May, an encouraging trend for prospective homebuyers at a time when the U.S. housing market remains largely held back by elevated borrowing costs and rising prices.",
      "The long-term rate fell to 6.77% from 6.81% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.86%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell. The average rate dropped to 5.89% from 5.96% last week. A year ago, it was 6.16%, Freddie Mac said.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "The average rate has fallen four weeks in a row, reflecting the recent pullback in bond yields. With the latest decline, the average rate is now at its lowest level since May 8, when it was 6.76%.",

      "Hundreds of millions of \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 loans will soon affect credit scores for millions of Americans",
      "NEW YORK -- Hundreds of millions of \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 loans will soon affect credit scores for millions of Americans who use the loans to buy clothing, furniture, concert tickets, and takeout.",
      "Scoring company FICO said Monday that it is rolling out a new model that factors the short-term loans into their consumer scores. A majority of lenders use FICO scores to determine a borrower\u2019s credit worthiness. Previously, the loans had been excluded, though Buy Now, Pay Later company Affirm began voluntarily reporting pay-in-four loans to Experian, a separate credit bureau, in April.",
      "The new FICO scores will be available beginning in the fall, as an option for lenders to increase visibility into consumers' repayment behavior, the company said. Still, not all Buy Now, Pay Later companies share their data with the credit bureaus, and not all lenders will opt in to using the new models, so widespread adoption could take time, according to Adam Rust, director of financial services at the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Typically, when using Buy Now, Pay Later loans, consumers pay for a given purchase in four installments over six weeks, in a model more similar to layaway than to a traditional credit card. The loans are marketed as zero-interest, and most require no credit check or only a soft credit check.",
      "The main three credit reporting bureaus, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, haven't yet incorporated a standard way of including these new financial products in their reports, since they don't adhere to existing models of lending and repayment. FICO, the score of the Fair Isaac Corporation, uses data from the bureaus to calculate its own credit score, and is independently choosing to pilot a new score that takes the loans into account.",
      "BNPL providers promote the plans as safer alternatives to credit cards, while consumer advocates warn about \u201cloan stacking,\u201d in which consumers take on many loans at once across several companies. So far, there's been little visibility into this practice in the industry, and the opacity has led to warnings of \u201cphantom debt\" that could mask the health of the consumer.",
      "In a statement, FICO said that their new credit score model is accounting for the growing significance of the loans in the U.S. credit ecosystem.",
      "\u201cBuy Now, Pay Later loans are playing an increasingly important role in consumers\u2019 financial lives,\u201d said Julie May, vice president and general manager of business-to-business scores at FICO. \u201cWe\u2019re enabling lenders to more accurately evaluate credit readiness, especially for consumers whose first credit experience is through BNPL products.\"",
      "FICO said the new model will responsibly expand access to credit. Many users of BNPL loans are younger consumers and consumers who may not have good or lengthy credit histories. In a joint study with Affirm, FICO trained its new scores on a sample of more than 500,000 BNPL borrowers and found that consumers with five or more loans typically saw their scores increase or remain stable under the new model.",
      "For consumers who pay back their BNPL loans in a timely way, the new credit scoring model could help them improve their credit scores, increasing access to mortgages, car loans, and apartment rentals. Currently, the loans don't typically contribute directly to improved scores, though missed payments can hurt or ding a score.",
      "Since March, credit scores have declined steeply for millions, as student loan payments resume and many student borrowers find themselves unable to make regular payments on their federal student loans.",
      "Nadine Chabrier, senior policy and litigation counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, said her main concern is that the integration of the loans into a score could have unexpected negative effects on people who are already credit-restrained.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of information out there about how integrating BNPL into credit scoring will work out,\u201d Chabrier said. \u201cFICO simulated the effect on credit scoring through a study. They saw that some users\u2019 scores increased. But if you factor in something that, last week, didn\u2019t affect your credit, and this week, it does, without having very much information about the modeling, it's a little hard to tell what the consequences will be.\u201d",
      "Chabrier cited research that\u2019s shown that many BNPL users have revolving credit card balances, lower credit scores, delinquencies, and existing debt. Women of color are also more likely to use the loans, she said.",
      "\u201cThis is a credit vulnerable community,\u201d said Chabrier.",
      "Rust, of the Consumer Federation of America, said he doesn't expect this to be a game-changer for consumers who already have a credit profile.",
      "\u201cAre we at a point where using BNPL loans will dramatically alter your credit profile? Probably not,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it's important that people have reasonable expectations.\u201d",
      "Rust said the average BNPL loan is for $135, and that repaying such small loans, even consistently, might not result in changes to a credit score that would significantly move the needle.",
      "\u201cIt's not about going from 620 to 624. It's about going from 620 to 780,\u201d he said, referring to the kind of credit score jumps that affect one's credit card offers, interest rates on loans, and the like.",
      "Still, Rust said that increased transparency around the loans could create a more accurate picture of a consumer's debts, which could improve accurate underwriting and keep consumers from over-extending themselves.",
      "\u201cThis addresses the problem of \u2018phantom debt,\u2019 and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it could be something that keeps people from getting too deeply into debt they can\u2019t afford.\u201d",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- GE Appliances announced a nearly half-billion-dollar project Thursday that it says will create 800 new jobs and shift production of clothes washers from China to its massive manufacturing complex in Kentucky.",
      "The $490 million investment positions the Kentucky home appliances company to rank as the biggest U.S. manufacturer of washing machines, it said.",
      "\u201cWe are bringing laundry production to our global headquarters in Louisville because manufacturing in the U.S. is fundamental to our \u2018zero-distance\u2019 business strategy to make appliances as close as possible to our customers and consumers,\u201d CEO Kevin Nolan said. \u201cThis decision is our most recent product reshoring and aligns with the current economic and policy environment.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes as President Donald Trump attempts to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods. He has slapped 10% tariffs on imports from most countries and put 30% levies on Chinese goods. GE Appliances says nearly all the steel used in its U.S. manufacturing for its appliances comes from American steelmakers.",
      "GE Appliances said the project will move production of a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers from China to the Bluegrass State. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's sprawling Louisville production complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said. Once the added production is in place, the total area devoted to clothes care production at the Louisville complex will equal 33 football fields, it said.",
      "Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who has criticized Trump's tariffs, hailed the company's deepening commitment to the state.",
      "\u201cToday's announcement brings more appliance manufacturing back to the United States and solidifies Kentucky and Louisville as the global headquarters of GE Appliances,\u201d the governor said.",

      "The new manufacturing lines will open in 2027, the company said.",
      "Next door at the complex's Building 1, the company produces top load washers and front load dryers.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but lacks overall production capacity to make all of its products at its U.S. plants. So it contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and the investment announced Thursday is another step toward achieving that goal.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Medicaid provider tax overhaul central to President Donald Trump's tax cut and spending bill doesn't adhere to procedural rules",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Medicaid provider tax overhaul central to President Donald Trump's tax cut and spending bill does not adhere to the chamber's procedural rules, delivering a crucial blow as Republicans rush to finish the package this week.",
      "Guidance from the parliamentarian is rarely ignored and Republican leaders are now forced to consider difficult options. Republicans were counting on big cuts to Medicaid and other programs to offset trillions of dollars in Trump tax breaks, their top priority. Additionally, the parliamentarian, who is the Senate's chief arbiter of its often complicated rules, advised against various GOP provisions barring certain immigrants from health care programs.",
      "Republicans scrambled Thursday to respond, with some calling for challenging, or ever firing, the nonpartisan parliamentarian, who has been on the job since 2012. GOP leaders dismissed those views and instead worked to revise the various proposals.",
      "\u201cWe have contingency plans,\u201d said Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota.",
      "Friday's expected votes appeared to be slipping, but Thune insisted that \u201cwe\u2019re plowing forward.\u201d",
      "But Democrats, who are unified against the package as a tax giveaway for the wealthy at the expense of American safety net programs, said the procedural decisions would devastate the GOP package.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the Republican proposals would have meant $250 billion less for the health care program, \u201cmassive Medicaid cuts that hurt kids, seniors, Americans with disabilities and working families.\u201d",
      "The outcome is a setback as Senate Republicans race toward a weekend session to pass the bill and send it back to the House for another vote before Trump\u2019s Fourth of July deadline. Trump hosted House Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP lawmakers in the East Room at the White House, joined by truck drivers, firefighters, tipped workers, ranchers and others that the administration says will benefit from the bill.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have grandstanders,\u201d Trump said of the GOP holdouts.",
      "Trump said there are \u201chundreds of things\u201d in the emerging package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered money to carry out his mass deportation plans. \u201cIt's so good.\u201d",
      "At its core, the big bill, which has passed the House and is now being revised in the Senate, includes $3.8 trillion in tax breaks that had been approved during Trump's first term but will expire in December, imposing a tax hike if Congress fails to act. To help offset lost revenues, Republicans are relying on steep cuts to health care and food stamps, and imposing new fees on immigrants.",
      "GOP leaders were already struggling to rally support for Medicaid changes that some senators said went too far and would have left millions without coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said more than 10.9 million more people would not have health care under the House-passed bill; Senate Republicans were proposing deeper cuts.",
      "After the parliamentarian advised against the Medicaid provider tax change, Republicans said they would try to revise the provision to make it acceptable, perhaps by extending the start date of any changes. They are rushing to come up with similar adjustments to other proposals that have run into violations, including one to change the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps.",
      "It's all delaying action on the bill, but Republican leaders have little choice. They are counting on the health care restrictions to save billions of dollars and offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the Budget Committee chairman, rejected calls to fire the parliamentarian, and said in a statement he was working with the office to \u201cfind a pathway forward.\u201d",
      "States impose the so-called provider tax on hospitals and other entities as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics say the system is a type of \u201claundering,\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the tax, while the Senate would cut the tax that some states are allowed to impose.",
      "Several GOP senators have opposed cutting the Medicaid provider tax, saying it would hurt rural hospitals that depend on the money. Hospital organizations have warned that it could lead to hospital closures.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., among those fighting the change, said he had spoken to Trump late Wednesday and the president told him to revert to the earlier proposal from the House.",
      "\u201cI think it just confirms that we weren\u2019t ready for a vote yet,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who also had raised concerns about the provider tax cuts.",
      "More than 80 million people in the United States use the Medicaid program, alongside the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. Republicans want to scale Medicaid back to what they say is its original mission, providing care mainly to women and children, rather than a much larger group of people.",
      "To help defray lost revenues to the hospitals, one plan Republicans had been considering would have created a rural hospital fund with $15 billion as backup. Some GOP senators said that was too much; others, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, wanted at least $100 billion.",
      "The parliamentarian has worked around the clock to assess the legislation and ensure it complies with the so-called Byrd Rule, named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. It essentially bars policy matters in budget reconciliation bills.",
      "If leaders moved ahead without altering the provisions, the measures could be challenged, requiring a 60-vote threshold to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate divided 53-47 and with Democrats unified against Trump's bill.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty frustrating,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who wants even steeper reductions.",
      "Overnight Wednesday the parliamentarian advised against GOP student loan repayment plans, and Thursday the parliamentarian cited those that would have blocked access to Medicaid and other health care programs from immigrants who are not citizens. Earlier, plans to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were also found to violate the rules.",
      "But Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said there's no desire to challenge the parliamentarian's advice. \u201cIt's the institutional integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I'm convinced 100% she's wrong.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republicans lost another potential revenue source Thursday after agreeing to a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to remove the so-called revenge tax provision, section 899, that would have allowed the government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners and investors from certain countries. Bessent said he has reached a separate agreement with such countries.",

      "Power plants and industrial facilities that emit planet-warming carbon dioxide are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide, the primary driver of global warming, are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground.",
      "The process, called carbon capture and sequestration, is seen by many as an important way to reduce pollution during a transition to renewable energy.",
      "But it faces criticism from some conservatives, who say it is expensive and unnecessary, and from environmentalists, who say it has consistently failed to capture as much pollution as promised and is simply a way for producers of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to continue their use.",
      "Here's a closer look:",
      "Carbon dioxide is a gas produced by burning of fossil fuels. It traps heat close to the ground when released to the atmosphere, where it persists for hundreds of years and raises global temperatures.",
      "Industries and power plants can install equipment to separate carbon dioxide from other gases before it leaves the smokestack. The carbon then is compressed and shipped \u2014 usually through a pipeline \u2014 to a location where it\u2019s injected deep underground for long-term storage.",
      "Carbon also can be captured directly from the atmosphere using giant vacuums. Once captured, it is dissolved by chemicals or trapped by solid material.",
      "Lauren Read, a senior vice president at BKV Corp., which built a carbon capture facility in Texas, said the company injects carbon at high pressure, forcing it almost two miles below the surface and into geological formations that can hold it for thousands of years.",
      "The carbon can be stored in deep saline or basalt formations and unmineable coal seams. But about three-fourths of captured carbon dioxide is pumped back into oil fields to build up pressure that helps extract harder-to-reach reserves \u2014 meaning it's not stored permanently, according to the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "The most commonly used technology allows facilities to capture and store around 60% of their carbon dioxide emissions during the production process. Anything above that rate is much more difficult and expensive, according to the IEA.",
      "Some companies have forecast carbon capture rates of 90% or more, \u201cin practice, that has never happened,\u201d said Alexandra Shaykevich, research manager at the Environmental Integrity Project\u2019s Oil & Gas Watch.",
      "That's because it's difficult to capture carbon dioxide from every point where it's emitted, said Grant Hauber, a strategic adviser on energy and financial markets at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Environmentalists also cite potential problems keeping it in the ground. For example, last year, agribusiness company Archer-Daniels-Midland discovered a leak about a mile underground at its Illinois carbon capture and storage site, prompting the state legislature this year to ban carbon sequestration above or below the Mahomet Aquifer, an important source of drinking water for about a million people.",
      "Carbon capture can be used to help reduce emissions from hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel, but many environmentalists contend it's less helpful when it extends the use of coal, oil and gas.",
      "A 2021 study also found the carbon capture process emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that\u2019s shorter-lived than carbon dioxide but traps over 80 times more heat. That happens through leaks when the gas is brought to the surface and transported to plants.",
      "About 45 carbon-capture facilities operated on a commercial scale last year, capturing a combined 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide \u2014 a tiny fraction of the 37.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector alone, according to the IEA.",
      "It's an even smaller share of all greenhouse gas emissions, which amounted to 53 gigatonnes for 2023, according to the latest report from the European Commission\u2019s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.",
      "The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis says one of the world's largest carbon capture utilization and storage projects, ExxonMobil\u2019s Shute Creek facility in Wyoming, captures only about half its carbon dioxide, and most of that is sold to oil and gas companies to pump back into oil fields.",
      "Even so, carbon capture is an important tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industries, said Sangeet Nepal, a technology specialist at the Carbon Capture Coalition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a substitution for renewables ... it\u2019s just a complementary technology,\u201d Nepal said. \u201cIt\u2019s one piece of a puzzle in this broad fight against the climate change.\u201d",
      "Experts say many projects, including proposed ammonia and hydrogen plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, likely won't be built without the tax credits, which Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark says already have driven significant investment and are crucial U.S. global competitiveness.",
      "They remain in the Senate Finance Committee's draft reconciliation bill, after another version passed the House, though the Carbon Capture Coalition said inflation has already slashed their value and could limit projects.",

    "story": [
      "Lukas won 15 Triple Crown races, including the Kentucky Derby four times.",
      "D. Wayne Lukas, the Hall of Famer who became one of the most accomplished trainers in the history of horse racing and a face of the sport for decades, has died. He was 89.",
      "His family said Sunday that Lukas died Saturday night at his Louisville, Kentucky, home. Lukas had been hospitalized with a severe MRSA blood infection that caused significant damage to his heart and digestive system and worsened pre-existing chronic conditions.",
      "\u201cWayne devoted his life not only to horses but to the industry \u2014 developing generations of horsemen and horsewomen and growing the game by inviting unsuspecting fans into the winner\u2019s circle,\u201d his family said in a statement. \u201cWhether he was boasting about a maiden 2-year-old as the next Kentucky Derby winner or offering quiet words of advice before a big race, Wayne brought heart, grace, and grit to every corner of the sport. His final days were spent at home in Kentucky, where he chose peace, family, and faith.\u201d",
      "Lukas won 15 Triple Crown races, including the Kentucky Derby four times. Only good friend Bob Baffert has more Triple Crown victories, and Lukas owns a record-tying 20 in the Breeders\u2019 Cup World Championships.",
      "\u201cThe whole secret of this game, I think, is being able to read the horse: Read what he needs, what he doesn\u2019t need, what he can\u2019t do, what he can do,\u201d Lukas said in May before his 34th and final Preakness Stakes. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole key. Everybody\u2019s got the blacksmith, everybody\u2019s got to the same bed available, the feed man. We all can hire a good jockey. We all can hire a pretty good exercise rider if we\u2019ve got the means, so what the hell is the difference? The horse is the difference and what we do with him in reading him.\u201d",
      "Lukas was affectionately known around the barns and the racetrack as \u201cCoach\u201d because he coached high school basketball before his professional career with horses began. Even with months to go before his 90th birthday, he would get up on his pony in the early morning hours and go out to the track himself, rather than letting his assistants do the day-to-day work.",
      "Born Darnell Wayne Lukas on Sept. 2, 1935, in Wisconsin as the second of three children, he rose to prominence in the sport with quarter horses in races that are effectively sprints. He moved into thoroughbreds in the late 1970s and won his first Preakness with Codex in 1980.",
      "Lukas has 4,967 documented victories in thoroughbred racing, with his horses earning more than $310 million from more than 30,600 starts.",
      "\"Today we lost one of the great champions of Churchill Downs and one of the most significant figures in Thoroughbred racing over the last 50 years,\u201d Churchill Downs Inc. CEO Bill Carstanjen said. \u201cWe will miss his humor, his wisdom and his unmatched capacity to thrill the fans with the performances of his horses on our sport\u2019s biggest days.\u201d",
      "Achieving something of a career renaissance over the past decade, one he credits to finding the right owners willing to spend money on horses, Lukas won the Preakness last year with Seize the Grey. Asked what motivates him to keep doing his job well into his late 80s, he gave a pep talk fit for a locker room before a big game.",
      "\u201cIf you have a passion, you eliminate all the excuses,\u201d Lukas said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it works. You get up early. You go without a meal. You drive. You go without sleep \u2014 as long as you got the passion. Don\u2019t let that sofa pull you down. It\u2019s a little easy when that alarm goes off to say, \u2018Oh my God, I don\u2019t know if I really want to do this today.\u2019 Erase that. The most important decision you\u2019ll ever make in your life is your attitude decision. Make it early, and make the right one.\u201d",

      "The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither James nor the team announced the decision publicly.",
      "ESPN and The Athletic were among those to first report the decision.",
      "James, who recently returned to on-court workouts after taking several weeks to recover after spraining a knee ligament in the Lakers\u2019 final game of this past season\u2019s playoffs, told the AP earlier this month that he expected to be ready for training camp. That was an obvious sign he planned on returning for a 23rd year, one in which he'll break a tie with Vince Carter for longest NBA career by a player.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of time to take care of my injury, my knee, the rest of my body and make sure I\u2019m as close to 100% as possible when training camp begins in late September,\u201d James said in that interview.",
      "If any doubt existed even after that about James, the NBA\u2019s oldest current player, coming back for at least one more season, it\u2019s gone now. He had until Sunday afternoon to make his decision on the option, one that pushes his career on-court earnings to about $580 million.",
      "This coming season will be his first full year with Luka Doncic as a teammate. Doncic was traded to the Lakers from Dallas in February, but the team \u2014 which entered the postseason as the No. 3 seed in a loaded Western Conference \u2014 still fell in Round 1 to Minnesota.",
      "James turns 41 in December. He\u2019s been an All-NBA pick in 21 of his 22 seasons in the league, including a second-round nod this past season. No other player has more than 15 All-NBA selections.",
      "He averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists this past season. The NBA's all-time scoring leader has appeared in 1,562 regular-season games, 49 behind Robert Parish's mark of 1,611 \u2014 the most in league history. If healthy, James would obviously figure to break that mark this coming season.",

      "LONDON -- There are plenty of tennis players who might be daunted by the prospect of making their Grand Slam debut against someone ranked No. 1 and in a big stadium \u2014 in this case, Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon's No. 1 Court.",
      "Carson Branstine, though, is embracing the circumstances she'll find herself in Monday. Branstine, 24, is a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen \u2014 she was born in California and represents Canada, where her mother is from \u2014 and helped Texas A&M win the 2024 NCAA title. She is ranked just inside the top 200, but made it into the women's bracket at the All England Club by winning three matches in qualifying last week.",

You never know. With my game, maybe God\u2019s going to come down and say, \u2018You\u2019re going to have the best tennis of your life. You\u2019re not going to miss a single ball right now.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cI know that she\u2019s super pretty,\u201d Sabalenka replied with a laugh. \u201cThe other day, I opened social media, and she was giving an interview. ... I was like, \u2018Oh, my God, this girl is so beautiful.\u2019 ... That's all I know so far.\u201d",

It\u2019s pretty cool. So I just want to embrace it, really. I just want to take in the moment and play every single point. It\u2019s still another match. ...

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Carlos Alcaraz's first match on a grass court came just six years ago.",
      "He's obviously a quick study.",
      "When Wimbledon gets started Monday, the 22-year-old from Spain will play in the first Centre Court match of this fortnight, an honor reserved for the previous year's men's champion. The contest against Fabio Fognini will open Alcaraz's a bid for a third consecutive championship at the place.",
      "That's something only four men have achieved in the Open era, which began in 1968: Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Not bad company.",
      "Alcaraz already is 5-0 in Grand Slam finals, which includes going 2-0 at the French Open \u2014 which he won three weeks ago via a comeback from two sets down against No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the final \u2014 and 1-0 at the U.S. Open.",
      "Last year, the No. 2-ranked Alcaraz became the youngest man to win a major trophy on each surface: grass, clay and hard courts.",
      "But he's got a fondness for the green stuff.",
      "\u201cThe most beautiful tennis that we can watch is on grass. The style that the people bring to the court when they play on grass. ... The sound of the ball,\u201d said Alcaraz, who will go into Monday on a career-best 18-match winning streak, including a title at the Queen's Club tournament last weekend. \u201cThe movement is really tough, but when you get it, it\u2019s kind of (as though) you\u2019re flying.\u201d",
      "He loves that it allows him to show off the variety in his game and all of the skills he possesses.",
      "Few players smile as much as Alcaraz does while in the thick of things, no matter what challenges might be presented by the foe across the net or the tension of the moment. He is as creative as it gets with a racket in hand, sometimes to his own detriment, and admits enjoying seeing replays on arena video screens after some of his best deliveries (that technology isn't used at the All England Club, but perhaps it should be).",

      "Ch\u00e1vez has fought once since 2021 and is best known for failing to maximize the potential in his famous father's genetics. He is still the most credible boxer by far to share the ring with Paul, who is now 5 1/2 years and 13 fights into his lucrative boxing tenure.",
      "Paul has successfully leveraged his Internet ubiquity and his own hard work to become a force in the business of boxing, if not in championship bouts. He has founded a busy promotional company and flirted with mixed martial arts while becoming one of the most important combat sports athletes in the world on his unique career path.",

      "Ch\u00e1vez was away from the ring for three years before his return late last year, but Paul's invitation brought him back again \u2014 along with the thousands of fans who eagerly bought tickets in perpetual support of their champion.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez has fallen to innumerable lows during a lengthy boxing career conducted in the shadow of his father, one of the most beloved athletes in Mexican history. The son has failed drug tests, served suspensions and egregiously missed weight while being widely criticized for his intermittent dedication to the sport.",
      "He still rose to its heights, winning the WBC middleweight title in 2011 and defending it three times. Ch\u00e1vez shared the ring with generational greats Canelo \u00c1lvarez and Sergio Martinez, losing to both.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez even lost in 2021 to Anderson Silva, the former UFC champion and rudimentary boxer who lost a one-sided ring decision to Paul one year later.",
      "Paul's career as the world's most popular pugilistic sideshow could change soon: His financial potency makes it almost inevitable that he will be invited to fight under a sanctioning body's aegis, which means he could likely book a bout against an elite boxer whenever he chooses.",
      "On the solid undercard in Anaheim, 43-year-old former UFC star Holly Holm returned from a 12-year absence from the boxing ring to dominate previously unbeaten Yolanda Guadalupe Vega Ochoa.",
      "New Jersey welterweight Julian Rodriguez then earned a thrilling victory in the waning moments of the 10th and final round, staggering Avious Griffin with a sneaky left hand and eventually knocking the previously unbeaten Griffin sideways into the ropes for a stoppage with 5 seconds left.",

      "BEIJING -- While China's men's soccer team hasn't generated much excitement in recent years, humanoid robot teams have won over fans in Beijing based more on the AI technology involved than any athletic prowess shown.",
      "Four teams of humanoid robots faced off in fully autonomous 3-on-3 soccer matches powered entirely by artificial intelligence on Saturday night in China's capital in what was touted as a first in China and a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games, set to take place in Beijing.",
      "According to the organizers, a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with agility",
      "They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling. However, during the match several still had to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff, adding to the realism of the experience.",
      "China is stepping up efforts to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, using sports competitions like marathons, boxing, and football as a real-world proving ground.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offer the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots, helping to accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also emphasized safety as a core concern in the application of humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cFor example, a robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe.\u201d",
      "Booster Robotics provided the hardware for all four university teams, while each school\u2019s research team developed and embedded their own algorithms for perception, decision-making, player formations, and passing strategies\u2014including variables such as speed, force, and direction, according to Cheng.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "In the time before widespread vaccination, young children often lost their lives to devastating infectious diseases that ran rampant in America",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.",
      "Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2013 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed \u2013 and a longing to spare others from similar pain.",
      "With a mother\u2019s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter\u2019s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.",
      "Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque\u2019s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so funny!\u201d Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.",
      "Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.",
      "Janith recalled knowing \u201cthings weren\u2019t right\u201d almost immediately. The baby wouldn\u2019t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn\u2019t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred \u2013 evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.",
      "Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.",
      "Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith's place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.",
      "Jacque\u2019s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith\u2019s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith\u2019s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.",
      "Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous\u201d to family, friends and new people she meets.",
      "\u201cWhen you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn\u2019t know any different,\u201d Janith said.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what can happen, and I just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She\u2019d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn't share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt's not that she was against it,\" Tobin said. \"She just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. Karen \u2013 who Tobin described as a \u201cvery endearing, sweet child\u201d who would walk around the house singing \u2013 quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cShe immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,\u201d said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. \u201cWe never did get to speak to her again.\u201d",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they realize how destructive this is.\u201d",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "\u201cI could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,\u201d said Duguay, 68. \u201cThey told my parents I would never walk or move again.\u201d",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio's visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",
      "Duguay initially defied her doctors. After intensive treatment and physical therapy, she walked and even ran \u2013 albeit with a limp. She got married, raised a son and worked as a medical transcriptionist.",
      "But in her early 40s, she noticed she couldn\u2019t walk as far as she used to. A doctor confirmed she was in the early stages of post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time.",
      "One morning, she tried to stand up and couldn\u2019t move her left leg.",
      "After two weeks in a rehab facility, she started painting to stay busy. Eventually, she joined arts organizations and began showing and selling her work. Art \"gives me a sense of purpose,\u201d she said.",
      "These days, she can't hold up her arms long enough to create big oil paintings at an easel. So she pulls her wheelchair up to an electric desk to paint on smaller surfaces like stones and petrified wood.",
      "The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine \u2014 which is far more effective than earlier versions \u2014 that it doesn't just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further. \u201c Herd immunity \" keeps everyone safe by preventing outbreaks that can sicken the vulnerable.",
      "Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.",
      "Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009 after Van Tornhout and her husband tried five years for a baby. She was six weeks early but healthy.",
      "\u201cShe loved to have her feet rubbed,\" said the 40-year-old Lakeville, Indiana mom. \"She was this perfect baby.\u201d",
      "When Callie turned a month old, she began to cough, prompting a visit to the doctor, who didn\u2019t suspect anything serious. By the following night, Callie was doing worse. They went back.",
      "In the waiting room, she became blue and limp in Van Tornhout\u2019s arms. The medical team whisked her away and beat lightly on her back. She took a deep breath and giggled.",
      "Though the giggle was reassuring, the Van Tornhouts went to the ER, where Callie\u2019s skin turned blue again. For a while, medical treatment helped. But at one point she started squirming, and medical staff frantically tried to save her.",
      "\u201cWithin minutes,\u201d Van Tornhout said, \u201cshe was gone.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout recalled sitting with her husband and their lifeless baby for four hours, \"just talking to her, thinking about what could have been.\u201d",
      "Callie\u2019s viewing was held on her original due date \u2013 the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called to confirm she had pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn\u2019t gotten their booster shot.",
      "Today, next to the cast of Callie\u2019s foot is an urn with her ashes and a glass curio cabinet filled with mementos like baby shoes.",
      "\u201cMy kids to this day will still look up and say, \u2018Hey Callie, how are you?\u2019\u201d said Van Tornhout, who has four children and a stepson. \u201cShe\u2019s part of all of us every day.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout now advocates for childhood immunization through the nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family. She also shares her story with people she meets, like a pregnant customer who came into the restaurant her family ran saying she didn\u2019t want to immunize her baby. She later returned with her vaccinated four-month-old.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to us as adults to protect our children \u2013 like, that\u2019s what a parent\u2019s job is,\u201d Van Tornhout said. \u201cI watched my daughter die from something that was preventable \u2026 You don\u2019t want to walk in my shoes.\u201d",

      "Ticks can be active in any season and experts say it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ticks can be active in any season and it's important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you've been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2013 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn't always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\"",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",
      "The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.",
      "Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.",
      "Wear long sleeves and pants, and you can also spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, a chemical similar to a natural ingredient in chrysanthemums that makes ticks avoid the flowers.",
      "Don\u2019t forget to pay attention to outdoor pets. Medications can prevent fleas and ticks from attaching to a dog's skin. But it\u2019s still a good idea to check the fur after being outside.",
      "\u201cWherever pets can\u2019t easily groom themselves, that\u2019s where the ticks will be \u2013 on the ears, around the muzzle area, under the collar, between the toes,\u201d said Thangamani.",
      "Dogs and cats roaming outdoors can also bring ticks into the house.",
      "\u201cIf pets bring ticks in, a tick can live in the house for months until it finds its next blood meal,\u201d which could be another household member, he said.",
      "After removing the tick, keep an eye on the skin around the bite. If a rash or flu-like symptoms appear within several days or weeks, see a doctor.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend tick testing because results may not be reliable.",

      "Apple has moved to revamp its European Union app store policies as it seeks to fend off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc\u2019s digital competition regulations",
      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",
      "The changes made by Apple will make it easier for app makers to point users to better deals on digital products and options to pay for them outside of Apple's own App Store, including other websites, apps or alternative app stores.",
      "The California company is also rolling out a two-tier system of fees to accommodate app developers that want to use alternative payments.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",
      "The commission noted Apple\u2019s announcement and \u201cwill now assess these new business terms for DMA compliance,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. The rulebook was designed to rein in the power of big tech companies under threat of hefty fines worth up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements that developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options, and direct them to those offers.",
      "Apple's restrictions preventing developers from steering users to outside payment channels had been fiercely opposed by some companies. It's the reason, for example, Spotify removed the in-app payment option to avoid having to pay a commission of up to 30% on digital subscriptions bought through iOS.",

      "LONDON -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the country is pulling its support from the vaccines alliance Gavi, saying the organization has \u201cignored the science\u201d and \u201clost the public trust.\u201d",
      "A video of Kennedy's speech was shown to participants at a Gavi meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, where the vaccines group was hoping to raise at least $9 billion for the next five years.",
      "Gavi is a public-private partnership including WHO, UNICEF, the Gates Foundation and the World Bank. It has paid for more than 1 billion children to be vaccinated through routine immunization programs, saving an estimated 18 million lives. The United States has long been one of its biggest supporters; before Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, the country had pledged $1 billion through 2030.",
      "Kennedy called on Gavi \u201cto re-earn the public trust and to justify the $8 billion America has provided in funding since 2001,\u201d saying officials must \u201cconsider the best science available, even when that science contradicts established paradigms.\u201d Kennedy said until that happens, the U.S. won\u2019t contribute further to Gavi.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, said he and President Trump were concerned about how Gavi and the World Health Organization partnered together during the COVID-19 pandemic to work with social media companies \u201cto silence dissenting views, to stifle free speech and legitimate questions\u201d during a time when many people had questions about vaccine safety.",
      "Kennedy said Gavi continues to make \u201cquestionable recommendations,\u201d like advising pregnant women to get immunized against COVID-19 and funding the roll-out of a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in poorer countries.",
      "WHO and other health authorities have recommended pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID-19, saying they are at higher risk of severe disease.",
      "Kennedy said he has seen research that concluded that young girls vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis were more likely to die from all other causes than children who weren\u2019t immunized.",
      "Some observational studies have shown that vaccinated girls do have a higher death rate compared to unvaccinated children, but there is no evidence the deaths are caused by the vaccine.",
      "Gavi said in a statement Thursday that its \u201cutmost concern is the health and safety of children.\u201d The organization said any decision it makes on vaccines to buy is done in accordance with recommendations issued by WHO's expert vaccine group.",
      "\u201cThis ensures Gavi investments are grounded in the best available science and public health priorities,\u201d it said. Gavi said scientists had reviewed all available data, including any studies that raised concerns, and that the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine has \u201cplayed a key role in helping halve childhood mortality.\u201d",
      "The British government said Wednesday it would give 1.25 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) between 2026 and 2030 to Gavi. It said the money would help Gavi protect up to 500 million children in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries from diseases including meningitis, cholera and measles.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was the second in a week from San Francisco's federal court to dismiss major copyright claims from book authors against the rapidly developing AI industry.",
      "Chhabria found that 13 authors who sued Meta \u201cmade the wrong arguments\u201d and tossed the case. But the judge also said that the ruling is limited to the authors in the case and does not mean that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials is lawful.",
      "\u201cThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cIt stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of well-known writers that includes comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Jacqueline Woodson and Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2014 said in a statement that the \"court ruled that AI companies that \u2018feed copyright-protected works into their models without getting permission from the copyright holders or paying for them\u2019 are generally violating the law. Yet, despite the undisputed record of Meta\u2019s historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works, the court ruled in Meta\u2019s favor. We respectfully disagree with that conclusion.\u201d",
      "Meta said it appreciates the decision.",
      "\u201cOpen-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "Although Meta prevailed in its request to dismiss the case, it could turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. In his 40-page ruling, Chhabria repeatedly indicated reasons to believe that Meta and other AI companies have turned into serial copyright infringers as they train their technology on books and other works created by humans, and seemed to be inviting other authors to bring cases to his court presented in a manner that would allow them to proceed to trial.",
      "The judge scoffed at arguments that requiring AI companies to adhere to decades-old copyright laws would slow down advances in a crucial technology at a pivotal time. \"These products are expected to generate billions, even trillions of dollars for the companies that are developing them. If using copyrighted works to train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders for it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, from the same courthouse, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI company Anthropic didn\u2019t break the law by training its chatbot Claude on millions of copyrighted books, but the company must still go to trial for illicitly acquiring those books from pirate websites instead of buying them.",
      "But the actual process of an AI system distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "In the Meta case, the authors had argued in court filings that Meta is \u201cliable for massive copyright infringement\u201d by taking their books from online repositories of pirated works and feeding them into Meta's flagship generative AI system Llama.",
      "Lengthy and distinctively written passages of text \u2014 such as those found in books \u2014 are highly useful for teaching generative AI chatbots the patterns of human language. \u201cMeta could and should have paid\u201d to buy and license those literary works, the authors' attorneys argued.",
      "Meta countered in court filings that U.S. copyright law \u201callows the unauthorized copying of a work to transform it into something new\u201d and that the new, AI-generated expression that comes out of its chatbots is fundamentally different from the books it was trained on.",
      "\"After nearly two years of litigation, there still is no evidence that anyone has ever used Llama as a substitute for reading Plaintiffs\u2019 books, or that they even could,\u201d Meta's attorneys argued.",
      "Meta says Llama won\u2019t output the actual works it has copied, even when asked to do so.",
      "\u201cNo one can use Llama to read Sarah Silverman\u2019s description of her childhood, or Junot Diaz\u2019s story of a Dominican boy growing up in New Jersey,\u201d its attorneys wrote.",
      "Accused of pulling those books from online \u201cshadow libraries,\" Meta has also argued that the methods it used have \u201cno bearing on the nature and purpose of its use\u201d and it would have been the same result if the company instead struck a deal with real libraries.",
      "Such deals are how Google built its online Google Books repository of more than 20 million books, though it also fought a decade of legal challenges before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "The authors' case against Meta forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be deposed, and has disclosed internal conversations at the company over the ethics of tapping into pirated databases that have long attracted scrutiny.",
      "\u201cAuthorities regularly shut down their domains and even prosecute the perpetrators,\u201d the authors' attorneys argued in a court filing. \"That Meta knew taking copyrighted works from pirated databases could expose the company to enormous risk is beyond dispute: it triggered an escalation to Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives for approval. Their gamble should not pay off.\u201d",
      "The named plaintiffs are Jacqueline Woodson, Richard Kadrey, Andrew Sean Greer, Rachel Louise Snyder, David Henry Hwang, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Laura Lippman, Matthew Klam, Junot Diaz, Sarah Silverman, Lysa TerKeurst, Christopher Golden and Christopher Farnsworth.",
      "Chhabria said in the ruling that while he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to grant Meta\u2019s summary judgment tossing the case, \u201cin the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors -- not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models.\u201d",

But the U.K's Defense Ministry said Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran will \u201clikely negatively impact the future provision of Iranian military equipment to Russia,\" since Tehran had supplied \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of attack drones to Moscow.",
      "Israel\u2019s military would not comment on what it struck. Although it has carried out sweeping attacks across Iranian military facilities and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites, the impact on Iran\u2019s drone industry is not yet clear.",
      "The anti-jammer in the latest drone discovered in Ukraine contained new Iranian technology, suggested Beskrestnov. Other components in Russia's drones often come from Russia, China and the West.",
      "Although Russia's drones are based on an Iranian design, the majority are now made in Russia.",
      "And because much of the technology to make them, including the Iranian software and technical expertise, has already been transferred to Russia, the immediate impact on Moscow\u2019s drone program could be limited, experts said.",
      "However, if Israel struck facilities producing drones and components \u2014 such as engines and anti-jamming units \u2014 which are shipped to Russia, then Moscow could face supply shortages, experts suggested.",
      "Moscow makes its Shahed \u2014 meaning \u201cwitness\u201d in Farsi \u2014 drones based on an Iranian model in a highly secure factory in central Russia.",
      "The Alabuga plant in the Tatarstan region took delivery of its first Iranian drones in 2022 after Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal. It later established its own production lines, churning out thousands of them.",
      "The upgrades identified from debris in Ukraine are the latest in a series of innovations that began with Russia buying drones directly from Iran in the fall of 2022, according to leaked documents from Alabuga previously reported on by AP.",
      "In early 2023, Iran shipped about 600 disassembled drones to be reassembled in Russia before production was localized. In 2024, the design was adapted.",
      "Specialists added cameras to some drones and implemented a plan, revealed in an AP investigation, dubbed Operation False Target \u2014 creating decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.",
      "Alabuga also modified the Shahed to make it more lethal, creating a thermobaric drone which sucks out all the oxygen in its path \u2014 potentially collapsing lungs, crushing eyeballs and causing brain damage. The size of the warhead was also upgraded.",
      "In at least one case, Iran shipped a jet-powered Shahed that Russia \u201cexperimented\u201d with in Ukraine, said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Russian and Iranian drones at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force found two more examples of jet-powered Shaheds in May but it appears they have not been widely adopted.",
      "That\u2019s possibly because the Iranian design uses a very sophisticated jet engine that also powers Iran\u2019s cruise missiles, Hinz said. That likely makes it too expensive to use nightly in Ukraine, he said, even if the engine is swapped to a cheaper Chinese model.",
      "The electronics in the drone most recently found in Ukraine are also very expensive, Beskrestnov said, pointing to its AI computing platform, camera and radio link. It\u2019s unclear why it was deployed but Beskrestnov suggested it could be used to target \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d including electrical transmission towers.",
      "Previous versions of the Shahed drone could not hit a moving object or change their flight path once launched. They sometimes ended up \u201ctraveling in circles all through Ukraine before they finally hit a target,\u201d which made them easier to shoot down, said David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "The radio link means an operator can communicate with the drone from Russia, introduce a new target and potentially control many drones at the same time, the experts said.",
      "The remotely operable Shahed has similarities to drones Russia is already using on the front lines and is particularly resistant to jamming, Beskrestnov said.",
      "There are eight, rather than four, antennas on the drone which means it is harder for Ukraine to overwhelm it with electronic warfare, he said.",
      "The new drone has markings that suggest the anti-jamming unit was made in Iran within the past year and similarities to Iranian components found in older models of the Shahed, said Beskrestnov.",
      "Such advanced antennas, said Hinz, have not previously been seen on drones used in Ukraine but have been found on Iranian missiles destined for Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense told AP in the past four months it had found drones with eight and 12 antennas made in China and Russia.",
      "Despite sanctions, both Russia and Iran have continued to find ways to procure Western technology.",
      "The drone\u2019s AI computing platform can help it autonomously navigate if communications are jammed. Similar technology was used by Ukraine to attack aircraft deep inside Russia during Operation Spiderweb, when it used drones to target Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",
      "Russia is improving its technology at the same time as it is also changing its tactics.",
      "Moscow is flying the Shahed drones at high altitudes where they are out of reach of Ukrainian shooters, as well as lower down to avoid radio detection.",
      "It is also carrying out massive group attacks on cities including where drones sometimes dive-bomb a target, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said.",
      "The drones can be used to clear a path for cruise missiles or to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses by sending a wave of decoys followed by one or two with a warhead.",
      "The tactics appear to be working.",
      "AP collected almost a year\u2019s worth of Russian drone strike data on Ukraine posted online by the Ukrainian air force.",
      "An analysis shows that Russia significantly ramped up its attacks after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. And Russian hits have increased markedly since March \u2014 shortly before reports emerged that Russia was using Shahed drones with advanced jammers.",
      "In November 2024, only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target but, by June, that reached about 16%. On some nights, almost 50% of drones got through Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.",
      "Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said the Shaheds' effectiveness is likely because Russia is firing more drones, including decoys, as well as the change in technology and tactics.",
      "But although Russia appears to have had increasing success striking Ukraine, it is not clear if that will continue.",
      "Israel's strikes on Iran will \u201ccertainly\u201d hurt Russia long-term, Albright said.",
      "Moscow, he said, is \u201cnot going to be able to get as much assistance from Iran as it has been.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "This story has been corrected to show only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target in November 2024, not November 2022.",
      "\u2014\u2014",

      "Hackers backing Iran have targeted U.S. banks, defense contractors and oil industry companies following American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Hackers backing Tehran have targeted U.S. banks, defense contractors and oil industry companies following American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 but so far have not caused widespread disruptions to critical infrastructure or the economy.",
      "But that could change if the ceasefire between Iran and Israel collapses or if independent hacking groups supporting Iran make good on promises to wage their own digital conflict against the U.S., analysts and cyber experts say.",
      "The U.S. strikes could even prompt Iran, Russia, China and North Korea to double down on investments in cyberwarfare, according to Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor.",
      "Bellini noted that hacking operations are much cheaper than bullets, planes or nuclear arms \u2014 what defense analysts call kinetic warfare. America may be militarily dominant, he said, but its reliance on digital technology poses a vulnerability.",
      "\u201cWe just showed the world: You don\u2019t want to mess with us kinetically,\u201d said Bellini, CEO of Bellini Capital. \u201cBut we are wide open digitally. We are like Swiss cheese.\"",
      "Two pro-Palestinian hacking groups claimed they targeted more than a dozen aviation firms, banks and oil companies following the U.S. strikes over the weekend.",
      "The hackers detailed their work in a post on the Telegram messaging service and urged other hackers to follow their lead, according to researchers at the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the groups' activity.",
      "The attacks were denial-of-service attacks, in which a hacker tries to disrupt a website or online network.",
      "\u201cWe increase attacks from today,\u201d one of the hacker groups, known as Mysterious Team, posted Monday.",
      "Federal authorities say they are on guard for additional attempts by hackers to penetrate U.S. networks.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security issued a public bulletin Sunday warning of increased Iranian cyber threats. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement Tuesday urging organizations that operate critical infrastructure like water systems, pipelines or power plants to stay vigilant.",
      "While it lacks the technical abilities of China or Russia, Iran has long been known as a \u201cchaos agent\u201d when it comes to using cyberattacks to steal secrets, score political points or frighten opponents.",
      "Cyberattacks mounted by Iran's government may end if the ceasefire holds and Tehran looks to avoid another confrontation with the U.S. But hacker groups could still retaliate on Iran's behalf.",
      "In some cases, these groups have ties to military or intelligence agencies. In other cases, they act entirely independently. More than 60 such groups have been identified by researchers at the security firm Trustwave.",
      "These hackers can inflict significant economic and psychological blows. Following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, for instance, hackers penetrated an emergency alert app used by some Israelis and directed it to inform users that a nuclear missile was incoming.",
      "\u201cIt causes an immediate psychological impact,\" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave's SpiderLabs, which tracks cyberthreats.",
      "Economic disruption, confusion and fear are all the goals of such operations, said Mador, who is based in Israel. \u201cWe saw the same thing in Russia-Ukraine.\u201d",
      "While Iran lacks the cyberwarfare capabilities of China or Russia, it has repeatedly tried to use its more modest operations to try to spy on foreign leaders \u2014 something national security experts predict Tehran is almost certain to try again as it seeks to suss out President Donald Trump\u2019s next moves.",
      "Last year, federal authorities charged three Iranian operatives with trying to hack Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. It would be wrong to assume Iran has given up those efforts, according to Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cybersecurity expert who is now vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy, a Washington-based cybersecurity firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly certain that these limited resources are being used for intelligence collection to understand what Israel or the U.S. might be planning next, rather than performing destructive attacks against U.S. commercial organizations,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Calls to bolster America's digital defense come as the Trump administration has moved to slash some cybersecurity programs as part of its effort to shrink the size of government.",
      "CISA has placed staffers who worked on election security on leave and cut millions of dollars in funding for cybersecurity programs for local and state elections.",
      "The CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies also have seen reductions in staffing. Trump abruptly fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversaw the NSA and the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command.",
      "The Israel-Iran conflict shows the value of investments in cybersecurity and cyber offense, Mador said. He said Israel's strikes on Iran, which included attacks on nuclear scientists, required sophisticated cyberespionage that allowed Israel to track its targets.",
      "Expanding America's cyber defenses will require investments in education as well as technical fixes to ensure connected devices or networks aren't vulnerable, said Bellini, who recently contributed $40 million toward a new cybersecurity center at the University of South Florida.",
      "There is a new arms race when it comes to cyberwar, Bellini said, and it's a contest America can't afford to lose.",
      "\u201cIt's Wile E. Coyote vs. the Road Runner,\u201d Bellini said. \"It will go back and forth, and it will never end.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- It is often said music is the universal language of humanity. Now a 12-year-old Houston boy is putting that to the test among an unlikely audience \u2014 man's best friend.",
      "Yuvi Agarwal started playing keyboard when he was 4 and several years ago noticed his playing soothed his family's restless golden doodle, Bozo. He grew curious if it also could help stressed homeless animals.",
      "With help from his parents, who both have backgrounds in marketing, he founded the nonprofit Wild Tunes in 2023 to recruit musicians to play in animal shelters. So far he has enlisted about 100 volunteer musicians and singers of all ages and abilities to perform at nine shelters in Houston, New Jersey and Denver.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand the lyrics to enjoy the music. Just enjoy the melody, the harmony and the rhythms. So it transcends linguistic barriers, and even it can just transcend species,\u201d Agarwal said recently after playing hits like The Beatles' \u201cHey Jude\u201d and Ed Sheeran's \u201cPerfect\u201d on his portable keyboard at the Denver Animal Shelter.",
      "Agarwal, who was playing for an elderly miniature poodle named Pituca \u2014 Spanish slang sometimes used to describe a snob \u2014 said many of his four-legged listeners, which include cats, become excited when he enters their kennel. But after a few minutes of playing, they calm down. Some even go to sleep.",
      "He remembers a rescue dog named Penelope that refused to come out of her enclosure in Houston to be fed.",
      "\u201cWithin a short period of me playing, she went from not even coming out of her kennel to licking me all over my face and nibbling my ears,\u201d Agarwal said.",
      "A few stalls down from where he was jamming on his keyboard at the Denver shelter, volunteer Sarah McDonner played Mozart and Bach on her flute for Max, a 1-year-old stray boxer that tilted his head when she hit the high notes.",
      "\u201cThe animals having that human interaction in a positive way, I think, gives them something to look forward to, something that is different throughout their day,\u201d said McDonner, a professional musician who met Argawal in Houston.",
      "She helped bring the program to Colorado after moving to Denver a few months ago. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to give them something different from what they\u2019re used to in their little tiny cages ... and makes them more adoptable in the long run,\u201d McDonner said.",
      "While the effect of music on humans has been studied extensively, its role in animal behavior remains murky.",
      "Several studies suggest that classical music generally has a calming influence on dogs in stressful environments like kennels, shelters and veterinary clinics. But some researchers warn there is not enough data to support the claim.",
      "\u201cWe always want these really simplistic answers. So we want to say that music calms animals, for example, and I think that it\u2019s much more nuanced than that,\u201d said Lori Kogan, a self-described \u201cdog-person\" who chairs the human-animal interaction section of the American Psychological Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to happen before I think that we can unequivocally say that music is a great thing for animals.\"",
      "Kogan, a professor and researcher at Colorado State University, has studied for more than two decades how animals and humans get along. Research involving the effect of music on dogs often produces mixed results, she said, because there are so many variables: the setting; the volume, type and tempo of the music and the breed of the dog and its previous exposure to music.",
      "She suggests a case-by-case approach to introducing music to animals.",
      "\u201cIf you play music for your pet, and they seem to like it and they appear calmer, then I think we can say that that\u2019s a positive thing, that you\u2019re providing some level of enrichment for that pet. ... I would encourage people to give it a try and to see how their pets respond,\u201d she said.",
      "For Agarwal, his firsthand experience at shelters is undeniable evidence that music helps comfort stressed animals, and he plans to grow Wild Tunes into a nationwide program. The volunteers get something out of it, too, he said.",
      "\"You get a really great way to practice your instrument or sing in front of a nonjudgmental audience, which can boost your confidence,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco said in a ruling filed late Monday that the AI system's distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic\u2019s (AI large language models) trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\u201d Alsup wrote.",

      "The watchdog has until Oct. 13 to decide on whether to give Google the label.",
      "It has drawn up three other initial priority measures that it would carry out if it goes ahead.",

      "Waymo's robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta on Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber that began earlier this year in Austin.",
      "Waymo's driverless march into Atlanta comes just days after Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, more than five years after CEO Elon Musk brashly promised the electric automaker would quickly overtake Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving technology. Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Tesla is initially placing a human in the passenger seat of its rival service to take over the vehicle if something goes wrong.",
      "While Tesla is starting with about a dozen supervised robotaxis, Waymo and Uber have dispatched about 100 completely driverless vehicles in Austin less than four months after their partnership began. The expansion into Atlanta keeps the two companies aligned with a road map they laid out last September.",
      "As has been the case in Austin, Waymo's robotaxis in Atlanta will be dispatched through Uber's app. Uber will give customers a choice to request a car operated by a human if they don't want to take a driverless ride. The robotaxis will initially cover a 65-square-mile (168,00-square-kilometers) area within the Atlanta market before expanding to a larger stretch.",
      "Waymo's own ride-hailing app is available in Phoenix, Los Angeles and a steadily expanding swath of the San Francisco Bay Area. Factoring in its partnership with Uber, Waymo is currently providing more than 250,000 paid rides per week \u2014 making it the early frontrunner in the still-nascent robotaxi market.",
      "But competition looms down the road as Musk continues to insist Tesla's robotaxi service will be able to grow quickly and Amazon gears up to bring its Zoox driverless cabs to Las Vegas later this year \u2014 with plans to expand into San Francisco next year. Zoox is also aiming to bring its robotaxi service to Atlanta, although it hasn't set a target date for that yet.",
      "Uber once had ambitions to build robotaxis, but reversed course after a bruising legal battle with Waymo, which alleged the ride-hailing company stole its autonomous technology after poaching one of its engineers. After reaching a $245 million settlement with Waymo, Uber eventually sold its self-driving vehicle division following a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Uber then pivoted to robotaxi partnerships to remain competitive as driverless cabs reshape the ride-hailing market. \u201cBy integrating Waymo\u2019s cutting-edge technology into the Uber platform, we\u2019re continuing to make transportation more convenient, sustainable, and reliable,\u201d said Sarfraz Maredia, who oversees Uber's efforts in autonomous driving.",
      "With 18 different robotaxi partnerships in place around the world, Uber says it is on pace to make about 1.5 million annual driverless trips that either transport passengers or deliver food.",

      "Mamdani's success reflects the ideological realignment of many American Jews since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel that led to Israel's invasion of Gaza. Many Democratic voters, including Jews, have grown dismayed by Israel\u2019s conduct in the war and are deeply critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That is especially true among younger, more progressive voters, many of whom have rejected the once-broadly accepted notion that anti-Israel sentiment is inherently antisemitic.",
      "For others, Mamdani's showing has spurred new fears about safety and the waning influence of Jewish voters in a city where anti-Jewish hate crime has surged. Last year, Jews were the target of more than half of the hate crimes in the city.",
      "\u201cDefinitely people are concerned,\" said Rabbi Shimon Hecht, of Congregation B\u2019nai Jacob in Brooklyn, who said he has heard from congregants in recent days who hope Mamdani will be beaten in the November general election, where he will face Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and possibly Cuomo, if he stays in the race.",
      "\u201cI think like every upsetting election, it\u2019s a wake-up call for people,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cI strongly believe that he will not be elected as our next mayor, but it's going to take a lot of uniting among the Jewish people and others who are concerned about these issues. We have to unify.\"",
      "Veteran New York Democratic political strategist Hank Sheinkopf put it more bluntly, predicting a hasty exodus of religious Jews from the city and a decline in long-standing Jewish influence that would be replicated elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of Jewish New York as we know it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cNew York is a petri dish for national Democratic politics. And what happened here is what will likely happen in cities across the country.\"",
      "Mamdani\u2019s top Democratic rival, the former governor, had called antisemitism and support for Israel \"the most important issue\u201d of the campaign.",
      "Mamdani's backers repeatedly accused Cuomo of trying to weaponize the issue. Many drew parallels to the way Republican President Donald Trump has cast any criticism of Israel's actions as antisemitic, claiming Jews who vote for Democrats \u201chate Israel\" and their own religion.",
      "For some Mamdani supporters, the election results signaled a rejection by voters of one of Cuomo\u2019s arguments: that an upstart socialist with pro-Palestinian views posed a threat to New York\u2019s Jewish community.",
      "Many were focused on issues such as affordability in a notoriously expensive city, or flat-out opposed to Cuomo, who was forced to resign in disgrace amid sexual harassment allegations.",
      "Aiyana Leong Knauer, a 35-year-old Brooklyn bartender who is Jewish and backed Mamdani, said the vote represented \u201cNew Yorkers, many of them Jewish, saying we care more about having an affordable city than sowing division.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of us take really deep offense to our history being weaponized against us,\u201d she said. \u201cJewish people all over the world have well-founded fears for their safety, but Jews in New York are safe overall.\u201d",
      "Others agreed with Mamdani's views on Israel.",
      "Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, an anti-Zionist, progressive group that worked on Mamdani's behalf, said Mamdani \u201cwas actually pretty popular among a lot of Jewish voters.\"",
      "\u201cThat is not in spite of his support for Palestinian rights. That is because of his support for Palestinian rights,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been a massive rupture within the Jewish community and more and more Jews of all generations, but especially younger generations,\u201d she said, now refuse to be tied to what they see as a rogue government committing atrocities against civilians.",
      "Polls show support for Israel has declined since the war began. Overall, a slight majority of Americans now express a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d unfavorable opinion of Israel, according to a March Pew Research Center poll, compared with 42% in 2022. Democrats\u2019 views are particularly negative, with nearly 70% holding an unfavorable opinion versus less than 40% of Republicans.",
      "Mamdani's wasn't the only race where Israel was on voters' minds.",
      "In Brooklyn, City Councilwoman Shahana Hanif, who represents Park Slope and surrounding areas, drew criticism for her Palestinian advocacy. Some said she had failed to respond forcefully to antisemitic incidents in the district.",
      "Yet Hanif, the first Muslim woman elected to the City Council, easily beat her top challenger, Maya Kornberg, who is Jewish, despite an influx of money from wealthy, pro-Israel groups and donors.",
      "That outcome dismayed Ramon Maislen, a developer who launched Brooklyn BridgeBuilders to oppose Hanif's reelection and said antisemitism did not seem to resonate with voters.",
      "\u201cWe were very disappointed with our neighbors' response,\" he said.",
      "While campaigning against Hanif, he said he was routinely screamed at by residents and accused of supporting genocide.",
      "\u201cI think that those of us in the Jewish community that are attuned to that are cognizant that there's been some kind of cultural sea change that\u2019s occurring,\" he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a legitimatization of hatred that isn\u2019t happening in any other liberal or progressive space.\"",
      "Mamdani has repeatedly pledged to fight antisemitism, including during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d where he was grilled on his stance. He was joined on the show by city comptroller and fellow candidate Brad Lander, the city's highest-ranking Jewish official, who had cross-endorsed him. He has also said he would increase funding for anti-hate crime programming by 800%.",
      "But many of his comments have angered Jewish groups and officials, most notably his refusal to disavow the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\" which has been used as a slogan in recent protests. Many Jews see it as a call to violence against Israeli civilians. In a podcast interview, Mamdani said the phrase captured a \u201ca desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights.\"",
      "Given another opportunity to condemn the phrase, Mamdani on Sunday told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that it was not his role to police speech and he pledged to be a mayor who \u201cprotects Jewish New Yorkers and lives up to that commitment through the work that I do.\u201d",
      "Mamdani also supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which aims to pressure governments, schools and other institutions to boycott Israeli products, divest from companies that support the country, and impose sanctions. The Anti-Defamation League calls it antisemitic and part of a broader campaign to \"delegitimize and isolate the State of Israel.\u201d",
      "Mamdani has also said that, as mayor, he would arrest Netanyahu if the Israeli leader tried to enter the city.",
      "The ADL in a statement Thursday warned candidates and their supporters not to use \"language playing into dangerous antisemitic canards that time and time again have been used to incite hatred and violence against Jews.\u201d",
      "In his victory speech, Mamdani alluded to the criticism he'd received and said he would not abandon his beliefs. But he also said he would \"reach further to understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The administration can start planning how it will end birthright citizenship.",
      "The Supreme Court on Friday handed down a highly-anticipated ruling involving President Donald Trump's Day 1 executive order to effectively end birthright citizenship.",
      "But many questions remain about how such an order would be carried out on a practical level.",
      "And while the court's conservative majority limited nationwide injunctions issued by federal judges against the order, the court did not rule on whether the order itself is constitutional.",
      "Still, the decision could lead to a radical reshaping of a legal right to citizenship that's been long guaranteed by the 14th Amendment -- at least in the short term.",
      "Effective immediately, the administration can begin planning for how it would implement an end to birthright citizenship.",
      "Trump's order itself has a 30-day grace period before taking effect, meaning right now there is no change to birthright citizenship and children born everywhere in the country are still U.S. citizens.",
      "Regulations will need to be drafted and specifics of such an order still need to be addressed: for example, will every pregnant woman in America now need to go to the hospital with a passport or birth certificate?",
      "The White House on Friday had no clear answers when pressed for specifics.",
      "Federal district courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and New Hampshire will soon have to revisit nationwide injunctions issued there in light of the court's decision and tailor or narrow them to apply only to the plaintiffs who brought these cases.",
      "The plaintiffs were 22 states, immigrant advocacy groups and a number of pregnant noncitizen women.",
      "Challengers to Trump's executive order will continue to litigate the order on the merits. No court has directly considered the constitutionality of the executive order, though three lower courts have said it would appear to plainly violate the 14th Amendment and there are three longstanding Supreme Court precedents unambiguously upholding birthright citizenship.",
      "But for the remaining 28 states that have not sued, Trump's attempts to end birthright citizenship could go into effect in as soon as 30 days.",
      "Challengers can and will also fight broad implementation in other ways as it moves forward.",
      "On Friday, one group filed a class action lawsuit seeking broad protection of all noncitizen pregnant women, even those who are not plaintiffs.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated plaintiffs might also be able to challenge the administration's citizenship regulations, once issued, under the Administrative Procedures Act.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, though, struggled on Friday to address how exactly administration is planning to implement Trump's order.",
      "Asked who would be tasked with vetting citizenship (for example, whether it would be nurses or doctors as babies are being born) Bondi only responded: \"This is all pending litigation.\"",
      "Another reporter asked Bondi, \"If you have an undocumented baby, would that baby then be an enforcement priority?\"",
      "\"The violent criminals in our country are the priority,\" Bondi deflected.",
      "What's next for nationwide injunctions?",
      "More broadly, the administration will likely seek to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking Trump policies in other cases.",
      "Those hearings and decisions will play out in the coming weeks.",
      "\"These injunctions have blocked our policies from tariffs to military readiness to immigration to foreign affairs, fraud, abuse and many other issues,\" Bondi said on Friday. \"The judges have tried to seize the executive branch's power and they cannot do that. No longer.\"",
      "President Trump said similarly as he celebrated the ruling.",
      "\"So, thanks to this decision, we can now promptly filed to proceed with these numerous policies and those that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, including birthright citizenship, ending sanctuary city funding, suspending refugee resettlement, freezing unnecessary funding, stopping federal taxpayers from paying for transgender surgeries and numerous other priorities of the American people,\" the president said.",

    "story": [
      "Graham said he believes the regime still wants to make a nuclear weapon.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham said it's \"too early to tell\" if Iran has given up its nuclear ambitions following U.S. strikes against key nuclear facilities in the country, but the Trump ally said he believes it's still the regime's \"desire\" to make a nuclear weapon.",
      "On Friday, President Donald Trump seemed to dismiss the potential for Iran to resume its enrichment program, telling reporters, \"The last thing they're thinking about right now is enriched uranium.\"",
      "Pressed by \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl about those comments and whether Iran has given up its \"ambitions to be a nuclear power,\" Graham said, \"Too early to tell. I do agree that the three sites were obliterated.\"",
      "But, the South Carolina Republican argued that while Iran is \"done with that enrichment program,\" the regime is \"not done wanting to destroy Israel or trying to come after us.\"",
      "\"Operation Midnight Hammer was a tremendous military success. It set the program back, I think, a couple years,\" Graham said. \"But the question for the world, does the regime still desire to make a nuclear weapon? The answer is yes. Do they still desire to destroy Israel and come after us? The answer is yes. Until that changes, we've got to keep our -- we're in trouble.\"",
      "Trump has suggested there may be a meeting with the Iranians at some point soon. Graham said he believes Iran must publicly affirm Israel's sovereignty before any such meeting should occur.",
      "\"Here's the requirement to sit down and talk: They have to say, for the first time, the Iranian regime, 'We recognize Israel's right to exist. We don't like the state, we don't like what they do, but we recognize Israel has the right to exist as a people,'\" Graham said. \"If they can't say that, you're never going to get a deal worth a damn. So before you sit down with the Iranians, make them say publicly for the first time, 'Israel has a right to exist,' and they can't say that, that tells you all you need to know about who you're dealing with.\"",
      "Here are more highlights from Graham's interview:",
      "Graham: So what does this bill do? If you're buying products from Russia and you're not helping Ukraine, then there's a 500% tariff on your products coming to the United States. India and China buy 70% of Putin's oil. They keep his war machine going. My bill has 84 co-sponsors. It would allow the President to put tariffs on China and India and other countries, to get them \u2014 stop them from supporting Putin's war machine, to get him to the table for the first time yesterday, the President told me --",
      "Karl: You were playing golf with him.",
      "Graham: Yeah, I was playing golf with him. He says, 'It's time to move, move your bill.' 'There's a waiver in the bill, Mr. President, you're in charge of whether or not it's to be implemented.' But we're going to give President Trump a tool in the toolbox he doesn't have today. After the July break, we're going to pass a bill that would allow the president --",
      "Karl: And he's going to sign it?",
      "Graham: Yeah, I think we're in good shape, but he has a waiver. It's up to him how to impose it, but we're trying to get Putin to the table.",
      "Graham: So the ruling was, a single judge cannot stop policy for the entire country -- that's beyond the mandate of a federal district court judge. You still have judicial review, but it has to go up the chain. A single judge can't stop a program for the entire country. And that's a good thing, because people were going judge shopping. The right would go judge --",
      "Karl: I mean, you were going judge-shopping back in the day.",
      "Graham: Everybody goes judge-shopping!",
      "Karl: I'm old enough to remember when you were all in favor of the injunction against DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) under Obama.",
      "Graham: Totally! I mean -- and I'm here to say, judge-shopping needs to stop. We need to have a system where if you're going to enjoin policy for the nation, it's done at a higher level than a single judge for the left or the right.",
      "Karl: The president went on a tirade against Tillis last night, said he's going to meet with primary challengers, said that he's grandstanding on all of this. What do you make of that? Is it grandstanding?",
      "Graham: I've been on the receiving end of that (laughs).",
      "Karl: Yes, you have.",
      "Graham: He runs hard, and he can forgive. We're trying to do hard things that should be done and have to be done. We're $37 trillion in debt. Medicaid has grown 50% in five years. It's about to take over Medicare. What we've done [in this bill] is limited the growth to 6% for two years, 4% after that, so Medicaid is not cut.",

      "Trump said he ordered the attack on June 21 to strike a uranium enrichment site located in 300 feet deep in a mountain in Fordo in northwestern Iran, an uranium enrichment site in Natanz and the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center following reports that Iranian officials failed to comply with international nuclear regulations.",
      "And as those early damage assessments cast doubt on the extent to which Iran nuclear program was crippled, several of Trump's top aides and allied lawmakers also appeared to scale back the stated goals of the attack.",
      "Here are some of the accounts and characterizations over the last week.",
      "On Sunday morning, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed Trump's statement from Saturday night, just after the strikes, that the sites had been \"obliterated.\"",
      "\"It was clear we devastated the Iranian nuclear program,\" he added.",
      "Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, however, declined to go as far, saying it would take more time to assess the extent of the damage done.",
      "Hegseth acknowledged that damage assessment was ongoing but stuck by the description he and Trump were using.",
      "\"All of our precision munitions struck where we wanted them to strike and had the desired effect, which means especially the primary target here, we believe we achieved destruction of capabilities there,\" he said.",
      "Officials and inspectors from outside Iran have not been able to gain direct access to the bombed sites to make a first-hand assessment.",
      "Trump officials had a more nuanced take after news reports surfaced Tuesday about an initial Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that said the attack set back Iran's nuclear program only by months.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the leaks of the military's report but did not go as far as to claim that the sites were obliterated.",
      "Instead, he insisted that \"very significant, substantial damage was done\" to key components of Iran's nuclear program, \"and we're just learning more about it.\"",
      "At the same time, Rubio provided more details about the attack, including that the bunker-buster bombs were dropped on ventilation shafts leading deep inside Fordo's heavily fortified facility -- buried, officials and experts said, 200 to 300 feet inside a mountain.",
      "He ultimately acknowledged that it was difficult to get a read on damage inflicted to Fordo at this point, but asserted \"the bottom line is real damage was done.\"",
      "That same day, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard claimed in a statement that the three facilities were destroyed.",
      "The director general of the U.N.'s nuclear oversight agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said Wednesday that he believed some of Iran's enriched uranium had been moved from the sites before the attacks.",
      "Trump refuted that analysis.",
      "\"It would have taken two weeks, maybe. But it's very hard to remove that kind of material, very hard and very dangerous. Plus, they knew we were coming, and if they know we're coming, they're not going to be down there,\" he said Wednesday.",
      "Trump reiterated that the sites and the uranium were buried under rubble and inaccessible, adding that trucks seen in satellite images at the plant before the attack -- which some speculated could have been used to move the nuclear material -- were construction vehicles being used to cover the ventilation shaft openings with protective concrete.",
      "According to the two people familiar with the DIA's classified report, the bombing sealed off the entrances to two of the three nuclear sites targeted in the attack but most of the damage was done to structures above ground, leaving the lower structures intact.",
      "The assessment also found that at least some enriched uranium remained \u2013 possibly moved from the nuclear sites ahead of the blasts.",
      "The next day, on Thursday, Hegseth held a news conference where he slammed the news media over reporting but did not make the same assessment on the nuclear materials.",
      "Asked twice during the briefing if he could be more definitive about whether the enriched uranium was moved before the attack, Hegseth said the Pentagon was \"watching every aspect.\"",
      "At that same Thursday briefing, Caine noted it\u2019s not his job to assess the damage, saying, \"We don\u2019t grade our own homework.\"",
      "Hegseth also highlighted what appeared to be a different goal of the mission, arguing the attack had succeeded because it led to stopping the fighting between Iran and Israel \u2014 rather than the facilities' destruction because it destroyed Iran's nuclear program.",
      "\"We got that peace, that ceasefire, that option because of strength, because of [Trump's] willingness to use American military might that no one else on the planet can do with the kind of planners and operators that the chairman just laid out,\" he said.",
      "Then, on Friday, Trump echoed that sentiment.",

    "story": [
      "While a partial Trump win on nationwide injunctions, challenges can continue.",
      "The Supreme Court on Friday granted a partial stay of nationwide injunctions issued against President Donald Trump's executive order to effectively end birthright citizenship, handing Trump a win amid his showdown with federal judges who've blocked parts of his second-term agenda.",
      "The 6-3 opinion came from Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The court's three liberal justices dissented.",
      "The court, however, said it was not deciding whether the executive order from Trump was constitutional, rather focusing on whether a single judge has the authority to issue universal injunctions.",
      "\"Government\u2019s applications for partial stays of the preliminary injunctions are granted, but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue,\" the opinion read.",
      "Trump took a victory lap in a rare appearance in the White House briefing room shortly after the decision came down.",
      "\"Amazing decision, one we're very happy about,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "\"This morning the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch,\" he said.",
      "However, legal challenges will continue to Trump's Day 1 order to deny citizenship to children born on U.S. soil to unlawful immigrants or those on a temporary immigrant status, as the court did not rule on the merits of the cases.",
      "The individual plaintiffs in these cases remain protected under the injunctions issued.",
      "\"Prohibiting enforcement of the Executive Order against the child of an individual pregnant plaintiff will give that plaintiff complete relief: Her child will not be denied citizenship,\" Barrett said. \"Extending the injunction to cover all other similarly situated individuals would not render her relief any more complete.\"",
      "Trump can move forward immediately, though, with developing plans to implement the birthright citizenship order -- which will not take effect for 30 days.",
      "Friday's decision is a boost for Trump in his crusade against nationwide injunctions that have blocked some of the executive actions he's taken so far in his second term.",
      "Supporters of nationwide injunctions say they serve as an essential check to potentially unlawful conduct and prevent widespread harm. Critics say they give too much authority to individual judges and incentivize plaintiffs to try to evade random assignment and file in jurisdictions with judges who may be sympathetic to their point of view.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor read her blistering dissent aloud from the bench, criticizing the court's majority.",
      "\"No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from lawabiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.\"",
      "\"The majority holds that, absent cumbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so is necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief,\" she added. \"That holding renders constitutional guarantees meaningful in name only for any individuals who are not parties to a lawsuit. Because I will not be complicit in so grave an attack on our system of law, I dissent.\"",
      "Sotomayor accused the Trump administration of \"gamesmanship\" and said with this ruling the Supreme Court's majority \"plays along.\"",
      "\"Every conceivable source of law confirms, birthright citizenship is the law of the land,\" she wrote in dissent.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separately to underscore, in his view, the narrowness of the decision, insisting that class-action claims are still available and that the Supreme Court itself can and likely will review lower courts along the way with respect to scope of relief from an alleged illegal government policy.",
      "Kavanaugh also noted that the Administrative Procedures Act remains an avenue for plaintiffs to bring challenges to presidential policies on a nationwide basis.",
      "Reaction to the ruling was largely split along party lines, with Republicans calling it a win for the administration while Democrats expressed serious concern that Trump's actions could go unchecked.",
      "\"The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to limit courts of their long-held authority to block illegal executive actions is an unprecedented and terrifying step toward authoritarianism, a grave danger to our democracy, and a predictable move from this extremist MAGA court,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X. \"By weakening the power of district courts to check the presidency, the Court is not defending the Constitution -- it\u2019s defacing it.\"",

    "summary": "Republicans are aiming to tie Democrats to 33-year-old Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist and the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor.",
    "story": [
      "Mamdani's win vaulted him into the national conversation overnight.",
      "Speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition summit in Washington, D.C., an annual evangelical gathering in the nation's capital, Republican leaders showcased an emerging line of attack against Democrats to energize voters and defend their congressional majorities: the ascent of New York state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic socialist on track to become the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City.",
      "Mamdani upset former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday with a campaign that zeroed in on affordability: He pledged to raise taxes to He pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations, help fund city-owned grocery stores, eliminate bus fares and expand public housing initiatives.",
      "His win vaulted him into the national conversation overnight -- Republicans across Washington using it as a new opportunity to depict Democrats as \"radical socialists\" and out of step with the country.",
      "President Donald Trump posted that Mamdani was a \u201c100% Communist Lunatic\u201d the day after the primary.",
      "In his news conference on Friday, Trump said companies looking to the invest in the U.S. are \u201cworried that somebody like this communist from New York, gets elected. I can't believe that's happening. That's a terrible thing for our country, by the way. He's a communist. We're going to a communistic city? That's so bad for New York, but the rest of the country is revolting against it.\u201d",
      "The National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans' campaign arm, has also been quick to link the national Democratic Party to Mamdani.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents a swing district outside New York City and served with Mamdani in the state legislature in Albany, posted on X that Democrats in New York \"will pay the price for this insanity at the ballot box.\"",
      "\"Look at what we just had happen in New York,\" Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley said Friday, adding, \"This is where the Democrats are going. They are open borders, inflationary spending, weak America.\"",
      "While some progressive Democrats have embraced Mamdani, some of the party's leaders have stopped short of endorsing him. Some moderate Democrats representing New York's suburbs have criticized him and declined to back his campaign.",
      "A critic of Israel's government, Mamdani has faced allegations of antisemitism over past comments and proposals. In response, he has emphasized policies to combat antisemitism, said that he wants to focus on city issues and has said he supports Israel's right to exist as a state with equal rights for all.",
      "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, in a speech at the same conference as Whatley, also criticized Mamdani while seeking to tie him to Democrats.",
      "\"Listen, the progressive left will not stop. They will not stop trying to lead us down a path to socialism, and therefore we can never stop \u2026 Look what happened in New York. They nominated a mayoral candidate who would make Bernie Sanders blush,\" Youngkin said.",
      "\"But it's not just New York. This is the challenge that we continually face and why we have to continually remind ourselves that elections have consequences,\" he said.",
      "Ralph Reed, a Republican operative and chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, told reporters Friday that Mamdani's victory, and a general election win in November, would put him at the center of the Democratic Party as the leader of the country's largest city.",
      "\"The mayor of New York City is one of the most prominent political figures, not only in the United States, but in the world,\" he said. \"I don't care if you're Rudy Giuliani or Ed Koch or, you know, [Michael] Bloomberg, or you know, whoever it is. It's a big deal. I mean, whether the Democrats would want it or not if he won the primary, he's helping to define that party.\"",
      "ABC News has reached out to Mamdani's campaign for comment on the comments made at the conference.",
      "When he was asked by ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott on Wednesday about Republicans seizing on his self-identification as a Democratic socialist to paint all Democrats similarly, Mamdani responded, \"You know, I see that so many New Yorkers, especially the ones we saw [on primary] night, are not actually concerned -- they're excited, by a recognition of the inequality they're facing in their own lives.\"",
      "Some Republicans have launched what some are calling Islamophobic attacks against Mamdani. Born in Uganda, Mamdani, who is a Muslim of Indian descent lived in the United States since he was 7 years old and became a naturalized citizen in 2018.",
      "House Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee wrote on Thursday that he was requesting the Department of Justice open an investigation into Mamdani's citizenship, specifically his naturalization application.",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., in response to Mamdani's victory, posted a digitally-altered image of the Statue of Liberty covered in a burqa.",
      "Several Muslim Democratic members of Congress have strongly pushed back against Ogles' letter, calling on Democratic leaders to denounce the attacks.",
      "Democratic U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Andr\u00e9 Carson of Indiana, and Lateefah Simon of California wrote in a joint statement on Friday, \"These hateful, Islamophobic, and racist tropes have become so entrenched and normalized in our politics\u2026 They directly contribute to the ongoing dehumanization and violence against Muslim Americans.\"",
      "At a press conference on Friday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has stopped short of endorsing Mamdani but plans to meet with him, called Ogles's effort \"disgusting.\"",
      "U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., who has strongly criticized Mamdani over his views and endorsed Cuomo in the mayoral primary, wrote on X on Thursday, \"It is no secret that I have profound disagreements with Zohran Mamdani. But every Democrat \u2014 and every decent person \u2014 should speak out with moral clarity against the despicable Islamophobic attacks that have been directed at him.\"",
      "Other House Democrats also came to Mamdani's defense over the comments.",
      "Reed, who said he was not familiar with Ogles or Greene's posts, suggested other Republicans should focus on criticizing Mamdani's policies and legislative record.",
      "\"I haven't even seen it, but I wouldn't think that would be a dominant message,\" he told reporters. \"There's so much material on this guy.\"",
      "Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who won her seat last November while Trump carried the state of Michigan on the presidential level, downplayed the disagreements inside the party, and argued that Mamdani's victory in New York underscored voters' focus on the economy across the country.",
      "\"People, just like in November, are still really focused on costs and the economy, and their own kitchen table math, and they're looking for a new generation of leadership,\" Slotkin said on Thursday. \"It reinforces that you may disagree on some key issues, but understanding that people are concerned about their family budget, that is a unifying thing for a coalition.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of parents seeking to opt their children out of public school instruction that conflicts with sincerely held religious beliefs.",
    "story": [
      "The court voted 6-3 in favor of parents seeking to opt their children out.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, ruled in favor of parents seeking to opt their children out of public school instruction that conflicts with sincerely held religious beliefs.",
      "The case, brought by a group of Christian, Muslim and Jewish parents from Montgomery County, Maryland, sought a guaranteed exemption from the classroom reading of storybooks with LGBTQ themes, including same-sex marriage and exploration of gender identity.",
      "Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson cast the dissenting votes in the 6-3 decision.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court, said in the decision that refusing to allow parents to opt-out their kids from instruction that \"poses a very real threat of undermining their religious beliefs and practices\" violates the First Amendment protections for religious exercise.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education's \"introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks, along with its decision to withhold opt outs, places an unconstitutional burden on the parents' rights to the free exercise of their religion,\" Alito wrote.",
      "The court found that the parents are also likely to succeed in their lawsuit over free-exercise claims, and have shown they are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuit proceeds.",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor accused the court of inventing a \"constitutional right to avoid exposure to subtle themes contrary to the religious principles that parents wish to instill in their children.\"",
      "She also reproduced in full one of the books at the heart of the dispute -- \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" an illustrated children's book about a gay couple and their niece -- in the appendix of her dissent. Alito accused the book of advancing a \"specific, if subtle, message\" about marriage -- that two people, regardless of their sex, can get married so long as they love each other -- that is \"contrary to the religious principles that the parents in this case wish to instill in their children.\"",
      "\"The majority's myopic attempt to resolve a major constitutional question through close textual analysis of Uncle Bobby's Wedding also reveals its failure to accept and account for a fundamental truth: LGBTQ people exist. They are part of virtually every community and workplace of any appreciable size,\" Sotomayor wrote in her dissent while blasting Alito for his interpretation of the book. \"Eliminating books depicting LGBTQ individuals as happily accepted by their families will not eliminate student exposure to that concept. Nor does the Free Exercise Clause require the government to alter its programs to insulate students from that 'message.'\"",
      "In 2022, after introducing several LGBTQ-themed books into its language arts curriculum, the Montgomery County school board allowed parents to opt out if the content was deemed objectionable as a matter of faith. One year later, officials reversed course and said the opt-out program had become unwieldy and ran counter to values of inclusion.",
      "The parents alleged that use of the books in an elementary school curriculum -- without an opportunity to be excused -- amounts to government-led indoctrination regarding sensitive matters of sexuality. The school board insisted the books merely expose kids to diverse viewpoints and ideas.",
      "Pending the completion of the legal challenge, the school board \"should be ordered to notify them in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,\" Alito wrote.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority signaled during oral arguments in April that it was poised to establish a right of parents to opt out for sensitive subjects, saying it should be common sense.",
      "Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty who argued the case on behalf of the parents seeking the opt-out, called the ruling an \"historic victory for parental rights in Maryland and across America.\"",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents' permission,\" Baxter said in a statement. \"Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents -- not government -- have the final say in how their children are raised.\"",
      "An attorney representing the authors of some of the books involved in the case called the ruling \"a deeply disappointing blow to the right to read under the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"It is a fundamental betrayal of public schools' duty to prepare students to live in a diverse and pluralistic society,\" attorney Elly Brinkley, with U.S. Free Expression Programs, said in a statement. \"By allowing parents to pull their children out of classrooms when they object to particular content, the justices are laying the foundation for a new frontier in the assault on books of all kinds in schools.\"",
      "Brinkley said opt-outs for religious objections \"will chill what is taught in schools and usher in a more narrow orthodoxy as fear of offending any ideology or sensibility takes hold.\"",
      "President Donald Trump called the ruling a \"tremendous victory for parents\" during a White House press briefing Friday.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, during the briefing, thanked the Supreme Court for the decision, saying that restoring parents' rights to decide their child's education \"seems like a basic idea, but it took the Supreme Court to set the record straight.\"",
      "\"Now that ruling allows parents to opt out of dangerous trans ideology and make the decisions for their children that they believe is correct,\" Blanche said.",

      "Hegseth made the announcement in a video posted to X.",
      "\"We are taking the politics out of ship naming,\" Hegseth said. \"We're not renaming the ship to anything political. This is not about political activists, unlike the previous administration. Instead, we're renaming the ship after a United States Navy Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, as it should be.\"",
      "Peterson, Hegseth said, was a chief watertender who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism during an attack on the USS Neosho by Japanese bombers during the Battle of Coral Sea in World War II.",
      "According to the Navy, Peterson kept the ship operational and was credited with saving the lives of 123 of his shipmates before succumbing to his injuries.",
      "Milk was also a Navy veteran, serving nearly four years in the service. He was discharged at the rank of a junior lieutenant after being threatened with a court martial because of his sexual orientation.",
      "Milk was one of the first openly gay men elected to public office in the United States after winning a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. He was assassinated a year later.",
      "Hegseth ordered the Navy to rename the ship during Pride Month, which celebrates the LGBTQ community.",
      "Stuart Milk, the nephew of Harvey Milk and the founder of the Harvey Milk Foundation, told ABC News that his uncle \"would say this is a call to action\" and that sailors he met on the USNS Harvey Milk were \"very proud to serve\" on the ship.",

      "\"We sometimes go two steps forward and one step back,\" Stuart Milk said. \"This is a pretty big step back.\"",
      "But \"the fact of the matter is my uncle's legacy will live well past the 40 years' life of a military ship, but it's also endured quite a bit,\" he added.",
      "Lindsay Church, the executive director of the advocacy group Minority Veterans of America, told ABC News that Hegseth is \"America's culture warrior, and is bringing that particular lens into leading the Department of Defense, rather than focusing on military readiness and what will actually make Americans safer.\"",
      "\"We put that uniform on, we are Americans. When we take the uniform off and continue to serve our country, we are Americans,\" Church said.",
      "There are currently no plans to rename other ships in this class, according to Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson.",

      "While Hegseth said he wants to take the politics out of ship naming, the effort is an inherently political endeavor.",
      "Traditionally, the Navy Secretary -- a political appointee confirmed by Congress -- is in charge of naming ships at the direction of the president.",
      "Of the Navy's 15 most recently named aircraft carriers, 10 have been named for past U.S. presidents and two for members of Congress, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "In the past, Hegseth criticized efforts by the Biden administration to change the name of military bases that honored Confederate generals.",
      "In the case of Fort Bragg in North Carolina, which was named more than a century ago after a Confederate general who lost battles in the Civil War, Hegseth argued that \"legacy matters\" and it breaks a \"generational link\" for people who serve there.",

      "\"In no way is the Fort Bragg renaming comparable to a potential renaming of the USNS Harvey Milk -- which occurred very recently in 2016 under the Obama Administration and was widely viewed as an ideologically-motivated action that countless sailors and veterans found abhorrent,\" Parnell said in a statement.",

      "The home of the world's premier film festival is joining a growing global backlash against overtourism, which recently saw uproar over Jeff Bezos\u2019 and Lauren Sanchez' Venice wedding this weekend, water-gun protests in Spain and a surprise strike at the Louvre Museum.",

Larger ships will be expected to transfer passengers to smaller boats to enter Cannes.",

      "Group and solo travelers are trickling into Afghanistan by plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- By plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles, tourists are beginning to discover Afghanistan, with solo travelers and tour groups gradually venturing into a country that until recently was wracked by war.",
      "And the country\u2019s Taliban government, which seized power more than three years ago but has yet to be formally recognized by any other nation, is more than happy to welcome them.",
      "\u201cThe Afghan people are warm and welcoming and wish to host tourists from other countries and engage with them,\u201d Deputy Minister of Tourism Qudratullah Jamal told The Associated Press in an early June interview. \u201cTourism brings many benefits to a country. We have considered those benefits and aim for our nation to take full advantage of them.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a vital, multi-billion-dollar industry for many countries.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s isolation on the international stage, largely because of the Taliban\u2019s restrictions on women and girls, has left much of its 41 million people mired in poverty. As it struggles to attract foreign investment, the lucrative potential of tourism is far from lost on the government.",
      "\u201cWe are currently earning a considerable amount of revenue from this industry, and we are hopeful it will grow even more in the future,\u201d Jamal said, noting money spent by visitors can reach more layers of society than revenue from other industries. \u201cWe are optimistic this sector will evolve into a large economy, bringing significant benefits. It plays an important role in strengthening our national economy.\u201d",
      "Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week. The government has even set up a training institute for men \u2014 and it is only for men \u2014 seeking jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector.",
      "While visitor numbers are still very much a trickle rather than a flood, they are increasing. Nearly 9,000 foreign tourists visited Afghanistan last year, while nearly 3,000 people visited in the first three months of this year, Jamal said.",
      "Four decades of near-continuous conflict kept nearly all vacationers away from this landlocked country of towering mountains, deep gorges and millennia of history.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021 stunned the world and sent thousands of Afghans fleeing. But with the insurgency over, the bloodshed from frequent bombings and suicide attacks all but ended too.",
      "Attacks still occur, however. An Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains active and gunmen killed six people, including three Spanish tourists, in a May 2024 attack in Bamiyan, one of the country\u2019s main tourist attractions where centuries-old giant Buddhas carved into the cliffs were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.",
      "While Western countries still advise against travel to Afghanistan, a drop in violence from the two decades of U.S.-led military presence is indisputable, as the government is keen to point out.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has gone through many years of war and hardship. Now, we want tourists to come and see the true traditions and customs of Afghans, to understand Afghan life, creativity and resilience,\u201d Jamal said, noting there was \u201ccomprehensive security across Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Critics question the ethics of foreigners visiting Afghanistan for pleasure when its government discriminates so heavily against half the country\u2019s population.",
      "Education beyond primary school level is banned for girls and women and few professions are open to them. Women cannot enter parks, gardens or gyms.",
      "Beauty salons are forbidden. Authorities dictate how women dress and have demanded they cover their faces in public, a decree still flouted by many, particularly in Kabul.",
      "Some visitors say they contemplated the ethics, but ultimately wanted to see the situation for themselves.",
      "French-Peruvian Illary Gomez said she and her British partner, James Liddiard, debated for about a year whether to drive through Afghanistan as part of their U.K.-to-Japan camper van journey.",
      "\u201cSome things didn\u2019t feel morally right,\u201d she said.",
      "But once here, they said they found a warm, hospitable and welcoming people and beautiful landscapes. They didn\u2019t feel their presence was any form of support for the Taliban.",
      "By traveling, \u201cyou put money in the hands of the people, not the government,\u201d Liddiard said.",
      "The treatment of women is particularly sensitive for government officials. Jamal declined to comment on the subject beyond saying male and female visitors were welcome.",
      "\u201cThose who respect our laws and traditions have already come and can continue to come,\u201d he said.",
      "While most restrictions are strictly enforced on Afghan women, they are far more relaxed for foreigners. Although they must still wear a headscarf in public, foreign women are more likely to gain entry into some restricted areas such as parks and are rarely asked to cover their faces in public.",
      "Opening the country to foreign visitors was also a way of building bridges, Jamal said.",
      "\u201cIt is a great way to promote interaction between the people of different countries. It helps build international relations and is also beneficial for trade,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen foreigners come here, Afghans also learn a lot from them. In addition to expanding commerce, tourism also helps foster mutual understanding, cultural exchange and strengthens talents as people learn from one another.\u201d",
      "A foreign traveler seeing the country with his own eyes \u201ccreates closeness, builds connections and fosters trust among people,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cThey will respect each other\u2019s culture and the distance between peoples will diminish.",
      "\u201cSo this is not just economic development; it also brings spiritual and political benefits,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani is the expected Democratic nominee for New York City mayor.",
    "story": [
      "Zohran Mamdani is the expected Democratic nominee for New York City mayor.",
      "NEW YORK -- In choosing Zohran Mamdani as their candidate for mayor, Democrats in America\u2019s most Jewish city have nominated an outspoken critic of Israel, alarming some in New York's Jewish community and signaling a sea change in the priorities of one of the party's most loyal voting groups.",
      "The 33-year-old democratic socialist's surprisingly strong performance against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo makes clear that taking a stance against Israel is no longer disqualifying in a Democratic primary. The state Assembly member has declined to support the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state, refused to denounce the term \u201cglobal intifada\" and supports an organized effort to put economic pressure on Israel through boycotts and other tactics.",
      "Yet he excelled in the city with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel, and with the support of many Jewish voters.",
      "Mamdani's success reflects the ideological realignment of many American Jews since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel that led to Israel's invasion of Gaza. Many Democratic voters, including Jews, have grown dismayed by Israel\u2019s conduct in the war and are deeply critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That is especially true among younger, more progressive voters, many of whom have rejected the once-broadly accepted notion that anti-Israel sentiment is inherently antisemitic.",
      "For others, Mamdani's showing has spurred new fears about safety and the waning influence of Jewish voters in a city where anti-Jewish hate crime has surged. Last year, Jews were the target of more than half of the hate crimes in the city.",
      "\u201cDefinitely people are concerned,\" said Rabbi Shimon Hecht, of Congregation B\u2019nai Jacob in Brooklyn, who said he has heard from congregants in recent days who hope Mamdani will be beaten in the November general election, where he will face Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and possibly Cuomo, if he stays in the race.",
      "\u201cI think like every upsetting election, it\u2019s a wake-up call for people,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cI strongly believe that he will not be elected as our next mayor, but it's going to take a lot of uniting among the Jewish people and others who are concerned about these issues. We have to unify.\"",
      "Veteran New York Democratic political strategist Hank Sheinkopf put it more bluntly, predicting a hasty exodus of religious Jews from the city and a decline in long-standing Jewish influence that would be replicated elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of Jewish New York as we know it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cNew York is a petri dish for national Democratic politics. And what happened here is what will likely happen in cities across the country.\"",
      "Mamdani\u2019s top Democratic rival, the former governor, had called antisemitism and support for Israel \"the most important issue\u201d of the campaign.",
      "Mamdani's backers repeatedly accused Cuomo of trying to weaponize the issue. Many drew parallels to the way Republican President Donald Trump has cast any criticism of Israel's actions as antisemitic, claiming Jews who vote for Democrats \u201chate Israel\" and their own religion.",
      "For some Mamdani supporters, the election results signaled a rejection by voters of one of Cuomo\u2019s arguments: that an upstart socialist with pro-Palestinian views posed a threat to New York\u2019s Jewish community.",
      "Many were focused on issues such as affordability in a notoriously expensive city, or flat-out opposed to Cuomo, who was forced to resign in disgrace amid sexual harassment allegations.",
      "Aiyana Leong Knauer, a 35-year-old Brooklyn bartender who is Jewish and backed Mamdani, said the vote represented \u201cNew Yorkers, many of them Jewish, saying we care more about having an affordable city than sowing division.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of us take really deep offense to our history being weaponized against us,\u201d she said. \u201cJewish people all over the world have well-founded fears for their safety, but Jews in New York are safe overall.\u201d",
      "Others agreed with Mamdani's views on Israel.",
      "Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, an anti-Zionist, progressive group that worked on Mamdani's behalf, said Mamdani \u201cwas actually pretty popular among a lot of Jewish voters.\"",
      "\u201cThat is not in spite of his support for Palestinian rights. That is because of his support for Palestinian rights,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been a massive rupture within the Jewish community and more and more Jews of all generations, but especially younger generations,\u201d she said, now refuse to be tied to what they see as a rogue government committing atrocities against civilians.",
      "Polls show support for Israel has declined since the war began. Overall, a slight majority of Americans now express a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d unfavorable opinion of Israel, according to a March Pew Research Center poll, compared with 42% in 2022. Democrats\u2019 views are particularly negative, with nearly 70% holding an unfavorable opinion versus less than 40% of Republicans.",
      "Mamdani's wasn't the only race where Israel was on voters' minds.",
      "In Brooklyn, City Councilwoman Shahana Hanif, who represents Park Slope and surrounding areas, drew criticism for her Palestinian advocacy. Some said she had failed to respond forcefully to antisemitic incidents in the district.",
      "Yet Hanif, the first Muslim woman elected to the City Council, easily beat her top challenger, Maya Kornberg, who is Jewish, despite an influx of money from wealthy, pro-Israel groups and donors.",
      "That outcome dismayed Ramon Maislen, a developer who launched Brooklyn BridgeBuilders to oppose Hanif's reelection and said antisemitism did not seem to resonate with voters.",
      "\u201cWe were very disappointed with our neighbors' response,\" he said.",
      "While campaigning against Hanif, he said he was routinely screamed at by residents and accused of supporting genocide.",
      "\u201cI think that those of us in the Jewish community that are attuned to that are cognizant that there's been some kind of cultural sea change that\u2019s occurring,\" he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a legitimatization of hatred that isn\u2019t happening in any other liberal or progressive space.\"",
      "Mamdani has repeatedly pledged to fight antisemitism, including during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d where he was grilled on his stance. He was joined on the show by city comptroller and fellow candidate Brad Lander, the city's highest-ranking Jewish official, who had cross-endorsed him. He has also said he would increase funding for anti-hate crime programming by 800%.",
      "But many of his comments have angered Jewish groups and officials, most notably his refusal to disavow the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\" which has been used as a slogan in recent protests. Many Jews see it as a call to violence against Israeli civilians. In a podcast interview, Mamdani said the phrase captured a \u201ca desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights.\"",
      "Given another opportunity to condemn the phrase, Mamdani on Sunday told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that it was not his role to police speech and he pledged to be a mayor who \u201cprotects Jewish New Yorkers and lives up to that commitment through the work that I do.\u201d",
      "Mamdani also supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which aims to pressure governments, schools and other institutions to boycott Israeli products, divest from companies that support the country, and impose sanctions. The Anti-Defamation League calls it antisemitic and part of a broader campaign to \"delegitimize and isolate the State of Israel.\u201d",
      "Mamdani has also said that, as mayor, he would arrest Netanyahu if the Israeli leader tried to enter the city.",
      "The ADL in a statement Thursday warned candidates and their supporters not to use \"language playing into dangerous antisemitic canards that time and time again have been used to incite hatred and violence against Jews.\u201d",
      "In his victory speech, Mamdani alluded to the criticism he'd received and said he would not abandon his beliefs. But he also said he would \"reach further to understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Some Iranians are getting arrested by immigration authorities after living decades in the United States",
      "Mandonna \u201cDonna\u201d Kashanian lived in the United States for 47 years, married a U.S. citizen and raised their daughter. She was gardening in the yard of her New Orleans home when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers handcuffed and took her away, her family said.",
      "Kashanian arrived in 1978 on a student visa and applied for asylum, fearing retaliation for her father's support of the U.S.-backed shah. She lost her bid, but she was allowied to remain with her husband and child if she checked in regularly with immigration officials, her husband and daughter said. She complied, once checking in from South Carolina during Hurricane Katrina. She is now being held at an immigration detention center in Basile, Louisiana, while her family tries to get information.",
      "Other Iranians are also getting arrested by immigration authorities after decades in the United States. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security won't say how many people they've arrested, but U.S. military strikes on Iran have fueled fears that there is more to come.",
      "\u201cSome level of vigilance, of course, makes sense, but what it seems like ICE has done is basically give out an order to round up as many Iranians as you can, whether or not they\u2019re linked to any threat and then arrest them and deport them, which is very concerning,\u201d said Ryan Costello, policy director of the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group.",
      "Homeland Security did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on Kashanian's case but have been touting arrests of Iranians. The department announced the arrests of at least 11 Iranians on immigration violations during the weekend of the U.S. missile strikes. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said, without elaborating, that it arrested seven Iranians at a Los Angeles-area address that \u201chas been repeatedly used to harbor illegal entrants linked to terrorism.\"",
      "The department \"has been full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and violent extremists that illegally entered this country, came in through Biden\u2019s fraudulent parole programs or otherwise,\u201d spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said of the 11 arrests. She didn't offer any evidence of terrorist or extremist ties. Her comment on parole programs referred to President Joe Biden's expanded legal pathways to entry, which his successor, Donald Trump, shut down.",
      "Russell Milne, Kashanian\u2019s husband, said his wife is not a threat. Her appeal for asylum was complicated because of \u201cevents in her early life,\" he explained. A court found an earlier marriage of hers to be fraudulent.",
      "But over four decades, Kashanian, 64, built a life in Louisiana. The couple met when she was bartending as a student in the late 1980s. They married and had a daughter. She volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, filmed Persian cooking tutorials on YouTube and was a grandmother figure to the children next door.",
      "The fear of deportation always hung over the family, Milne said, but he said his wife did everything that was being asked of her.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s meeting her obligations,\" Milne said. \"She\u2019s retirement age. She\u2019s not a threat. Who picks up a grandmother?\u201d",
      "While Iranians have been crossing the border illegally for years, especially since 2021, they have faced little risk of being deported to their home countries due to severed diplomatic relations with the U.S. That seems to no longer be the case.",
      "The Trump administration has deported hundreds of people, including Iranians, to countries other than their own in an attempt to circumvent diplomatic hurdles with governments that won\u2019t take their people back. During Trump\u2019s second term, countries including El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama have taken back noncitizens from the U.S.",
      "The administration has asked the Supreme Court to clear the way for several deportations to South Sudan, a war-ravaged country with which it has no ties, after the justices allowed deportations to countries other than those noncitizens came from.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol arrested Iranians 1,700 times at the Mexican border from October 2021 through November 2024, according to the most recent public data available. The Homeland Security Department reported that about 600 Iranians overstayed visas as business or exchange visitors, tourists and students in the 12-month period through September 2023, the most recent data reports.",
      "Iran was one of 12 countries subject to a U.S. travel ban that took effect this month. Some fear ICE's growing deportation arrests will be another blow.",
      "In Oregon, an Iranian man was detained by immigration agents this past week while driving to the gym. He was picked up roughly two weeks before he was scheduled for a check-in at ICE offices in Portland, according to court documents filed by his attorney, Michael Purcell.",
      "The man, identified in court filings as S.F., has lived in the U.S. for over 20 years, and his wife and two children are U.S. citizens.",
      "S.F. applied for asylum in the U.S. in the early 2000s, but his application was denied in 2002. His appeal failed but the government did not deport him and he continued to live in the country for decades, according to court documents.",
      "Due to \u201cchanged conditions\u201d in Iran, S.F. would face \u201ca vastly increased danger of persecution\u201d if he were to be deported, Purcell wrote in his petition. \u201cThese circumstances relate to the recent bombing by the United States of Iranian nuclear facilities, thus creating a de facto state of war between the United States and Iran.\u201d",
      "S.F.\u2019s long residency in the U.S., his conversion to Christianity and the fact that his wife and children are U.S. citizens \u201csharply increase the possibility of his imprisonment in Iran, or torture or execution,\u201d he said.",
      "Similarly, Kashanian's daughter said she is worried what will happen to her mother.",
      "\u201cShe tried to do everything right,\u201d Kaitlynn Milne said.",

      "Pride celebrations are typically a daylong mix of jubilant street parties and political protest, but organizers said this year\u2019s iterations will take a more defiant stance than recent years.",
      "The festivities come days after the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark June 26, 2015, ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that recognized same-sex marriage nationwide.",
      "But Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, have sought to roll back LGBTQ+ friendly policies.",

      "The theme for the Manhattan event is, appropriately, \u201cRise Up: Pride in Protest.\" San Francisco\u2019s Pride theme is \u201cQueer Joy is Resistance\u201d while Seattle\u2019s is simply \u201cLouder.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not a time to be quiet,\u201d Patti Hearn, Seattle Pride\u2019s executive director, said in a statement ahead of the event. \u201cWe will stand up. We will speak up. We will get loud.\u201d",
      "Among the other headwinds faced by gay rights groups this year is the loss of corporate sponsorship.",
      "American companies have pulled back support of Pride events, reflecting a broader walking back of diversity and inclusion efforts amid shifting public sentiment.",
      "NYC Pride said earlier this month that about 20% of its corporate sponsors dropped or reduced support, including PepsiCo and Nissan. Organizers of San Francisco Pride said they lost the support of five major corporate donors, including Comcast and Anheuser-Busch.",

      "The Florida immigration detention site dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d is being met by opposition from a range of groups concerned with its impacts on local Native American tribes, the Everglades ecosystem and human rights for migrants",
      "A coalition of groups, ranging from environmental activists to Native Americans advocating for their ancestral homelands, converged outside an airstrip in the Florida Everglades Saturday to protest the imminent construction of an immigrant detention center.",
      "Hundreds of protesters lined part of U.S. Highway 41 that slices through the marshy Everglades \u2014 also known as Tamiami Trail \u2014 as dump trucks hauling materials lumbered into the airfield. Cars passing by honked in support as protesters waved signs calling for the protection of the expansive preserve that is home to a few Native tribes and several endangered animal species.",
      "Christopher McVoy, an ecologist, said he saw a steady stream of trucks entering the site while he protested for hours. Environmental degradation was a big reason why he came out Saturday. But as a South Florida city commissioner, he said concerns over immigration raids in his city also fueled his opposition.",
      "\u201cPeople I know are in tears, and I wasn't far from it,\u201d he said.",
      "Florida officials have forged ahead over the past week in constructing the compound dubbed as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d within the Everglades' humid swamplands.",
      "The government fast-tracked the project under emergency powers from an executive order issued by Gov. Ron DeSantis that addresses what he views as a crisis of illegal immigration. That order lets the state sidestep certain purchasing laws and is why construction has continued despite objections from Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and local activists.",
      "The facility will have temporary structures like heavy-duty tents and trailers to house detained immigrants. The state estimates that by early July, it will have 5,000 immigration detention beds in operation.",
      "The compound's proponents have noted its location in the Florida wetlands \u2014 teeming with massive reptiles like alligators and invasive Burmese pythons \u2014 make it an ideal spot for immigration detention.",
      "\u201cClearly, from a security perspective, if someone escapes, you know, there\u2019s a lot of alligators,\u201d DeSantis said Wednesday. \u201cNo one\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Under DeSantis, Florida has made an aggressive push for immigration enforcement and has been supportive of the federal government's broader crackdown on illegal immigration. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has backed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d which DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said will be partially funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "But Native American leaders in the region have seen the construction as an encroachment onto their sacred homelands, which prompted Saturday's protest. In Big Cypress National Preserve, where the airstrip is located, 15 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages, as well as ceremonial and burial grounds and other gathering sites, remain.",
      "Others have raised human rights concerns over what they condemn as the inhumane housing of immigrants. Worries about environmental impacts have also been at the forefront, as groups such as the Center for Biological Diversity and the Friends of the Everglades filed a lawsuit Friday to halt the detention center plans.",
      "\u201cThe Everglades is a vast, interconnected system of waterways and wetlands, and what happens in one area can have damaging impacts downstream,\" Friends of the Everglades executive director Eve Samples said. \u201cSo it's really important that we have a clear sense of any wetland impacts happening in the site.\u201d",
      "Bryan Griffin, a DeSantis spokesperson, said Friday in response to the litigation that the facility was a \u201cnecessary staging operation for mass deportations located at a preexisting airport that will have no impact on the surrounding environment.\u201d",
      "Until the site undergoes a comprehensive environmental review and public comment is sought, the environmental groups say construction should pause. The facility's speedy establishment is \u201cdamning evidence\u201d that state and federal agencies hope it will be \u201ctoo late\u201d to reverse their actions if they are ordered by a court to do so, said Elise Bennett, a Center for Biological Diversity senior attorney working on the case.",
      "The potential environmental hazards also bleed into other aspects of Everglades life, including a robust tourism industry where hikers walk trails and explore the marshes on airboats, said Floridians for Public Lands founder Jessica Namath, who attended the protest. To place an immigration detention center there makes the area unwelcoming to visitors and feeds into the misconception that the space is in \u201cthe middle of nowhere,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEverybody out here sees the exhaust fumes, sees the oil slicks on the road, you know, they hear the sound and the noise pollution. You can imagine what it looks like at nighttime, and we're in an international dark sky area,\u201d Namath said. \u201cIt's very frustrating because, again, there's such disconnect for politicians.\u201d",

      "President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to attend the funeral of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman on Saturday",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris will join the mourners Saturday at the funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was killed in a pair of attacks that authorities have called an assassination and that also left her husband dead and a state senator and his wife seriously wounded.",
      "Biden also paid his respects Friday as Hortman, her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert, lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda in St. Paul, a few hours after the man charged with killing them while disguised as a police officer June 14 made a brief court appearance in a suicide prevention suit.",
      "The couple\u2019s private funeral, at the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis, is set for 10:30 a.m. Saturday. It will be livestreamed on the Department of Public Safety\u2019s YouTube channel.",
      "Neither Biden nor Harris is expected to speak. Harris expressed her condolences earlier this week to Hortman\u2019s adult children, and spoke with Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, who extended an invitation on behalf of the Hortman family, her office said.",
      "Hortman, a Democrat, was the first woman and one of fewer than 20 Minnesotans to lay in state at the Capitol. It was the first time a couple has been accorded the honor, and the first for a dog. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. The Hortmans' caskets and the dog's urn were arranged in the center of the rotunda, under the Capitol dome, with law enforcement officers keeping watch as thousands of people filed by. Many fought back tears as they left.",
      "Among the first to pay their respects were Walz, who has called Hortman his closest political ally, and his wife, Gwen. Biden, a Catholic, visited later in the afternoon, walking up to the velvet rope in front of the caskets, making the sign of the cross and spending a few moments by himself in silence. He then took a knee briefly, got up, made the sign of the cross again and walked off to greet people waiting in the wings of the rotunda.",
      "Lisa Greene, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park like Hortman did, but in a different House district, said she came to the Capitol because she had so much respect for the former speaker.",
      "\u201cShe was just amazing. Amazing woman. And I was just so proud that she represented the city that I lived in,\u201d Greene said in a voice choked with emotion. \u201cShe was such a leader. She could bring people together. She was so accessible. I mean, she was friendly, you could talk to her.\"",
      "But, she went on to say admiringly, Hortman was also \u201ca boss.\"",
      "\u201cShe just knew what she was doing and she could just make things happen,\u201d she said.",
      "The man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin, made a short court appearance Friday for what the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson, has called \u201ca political assassination.\u201d",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history.",
      "An unshaven Boelter was brought in wearing just a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers. Federal defender Manny Atwal asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing until Thursday. He agreed. She said Boelter has been sleep deprived while on suicide watch in the Sherburne County Jail, and that it has been difficult to communicate with him as a result.",
      "\u201cYour honor, I haven't really slept in about 12 to 14 days,\" Boelter told the judge. And he denied being suicidal. \"I\u2019ve never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.\u201d",
      "Atwal told the court that Boelter had been in what's known as a \u201cGumby suit,\u201d without undergarments, ever since his transfer to the jail after his first court appearance on June 16. She said the lights are on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slam frequently, the inmate in the next cell spreads feces on the walls and the smell drifts to Boelter's cell.",
      "The attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity and let him communicate better.",
      "Boelter did not enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. According to the federal complaint, police video shows Boelter outside the Hortmans\u2019 home and captures the sound of gunfire. And it says security video shows Boelter approaching the front doors of two other lawmakers\u2019 homes.",
      "His lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson said last week that no decision has been made. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. Boelter also faces separate murder and attempted murder charges in state court that could carry life without parole.",
      "Friends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.",

      "More than four years after a Florida condominium collapse killed 98 people, federal investigators have yet to make a final determination of the cause",
      "More than four years after a Florida condominium collapse killed 98 people, federal investigators have yet to make a final determination of the cause \u2014 but they do have some leading theories.",
      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology, the agency handling the probe, said this week it hopes to conclude the investigation in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe intend for our investigation of this failure to have a lasting impact, save future lives and ensure this never happens again,\u201d NIST investigator Judith Mitrani-Reiser said in the agency's latest report.",
      "Most residents were asleep in the 12-story Champlain Towers South when the beachfront condo building in Surfside, Florida, collapsed into a huge pile of rubble at 1:22 a.m. on June 24, 2021. As the investigation continued, a Miami judge approved a more than $1 billion settlement for personal injury and wrongful death claims from the disaster.",
      "Meanwhile, a new luxury condominium is going up at the Champlain Towers site, a few miles north of Miami.",
      "NIST has zeroed in on what it calls three \u201chigher-likelihood\u201d scenarios, all related to construction flaws that date to the beginning of the 40-year-old structure.",
      "\u201cThese conditions existed from the time construction was complete, 40 years before the partial collapse,\" said Glen Bell, co-lead investigator on NIST\u2019s National Construction Safety Team.",
      "One possibility is the failure of a connection between a building column and the pool deck slab that never met building code standards. Another is that steel reinforcement \u201cwas not placed where it should have been,\u201d which meant the column and pool deck were far too weak.",
      "And a third theory is that work done later around the pool \u2014 when heavy planters, sand and pavers were added \u2014 increased the weight load on a deck \u201cthat was already functionally and structurally inadequate.\u201d",
      "The NIST report also notes that support columns in the building's basement parking garage had been exposed to frequent flooding, which causes corrosion in steel reinforcements and concrete deterioration.",
      "Investigators did not find evidence of voids in the ground under the building, known as \u201ckarst.\u201d Using satellite data, the NIST team found there was no sinking or settling underneath Champlain Towers, which would indicate existence of karst.",
      "In addition, investigators found the limestone upon which the condo was built was \u201csufficient to carry the building loads\" and that testing of the concrete supporting Champlain Towers had \u201cadequate material strength.\u201d",
      "One challenge for investigators was the lack of any available records from the original building construction and not many from its earlier years.",
      "After Surfside, state legislators enacted a law in 2022 requiring condo associations to have sufficient reserves to cover major repairs. Some residents were caught off guard by hefty fees imposed to cover years of deferred maintenance expenses required to bring their buildings into compliance with the law's standards.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis this week signed new legislation allowing some condo associations to fund their reserves through a loan or line of credit. It also gives residents more flexibility to pause payments into reserve funds while they prioritize needed repairs. It extends the deadline for condo associations to complete structural integrity studies and exempts some smaller buildings from those studies.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time to make the change,\u201d state Sen. Ed Hooper said. \u201cElderly people are losing their condos because they could not afford to make the increase in their monthly HOA fees. That\u2019s just wrong.\u201d",
      "It's a luxury condo building, dubbed the Delmore, with 37 \u201cmansions in the sky\u201d and a starting price of $15 million. The site was purchased at auction by Dubai-based DAMAC International for $120 million.",
      "According to the company, there will be amenities such as a see-through swimming pool, an indoor pool, an outdoor kitchen, a fitness center and a meditation garden.",
      "The new condo is expected to be completed by 2029.",
      "A design for a memorial to the 98 victims and that honors their families was approved earlier this year by Surfside officials and a family committee. But the city's planning and zoning board objected to its appearance and recommended that alternatives be considered.",
      "The existing proposal envisions a tall \u201cwall of water\u201d and exhibition of materials from the collapsed building. Surfside officials say they want to keep the project on track but will consider additional input, especially from the family committee.",
      "\u201cI understand the urgency. But this memorial is going to be here long beyond anyone in this room,\" said planning board chair Lindsay Lecour at an April city commission meeting.",

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Like clockwork, Carla Johnson sends out letters every spring asking for donations to help pay for the annual Fourth of July fireworks show that draws tens of thousands of people to New Mexico's largest lake.",
      "And she has no reservations about doling out verbal reminders when she sees her patrons around town. There's too much at stake to be shy about fundraising when donations collected by Friends of Elephant Butte Lake State Park are what make the tradition possible.",
      "But even Johnson\u2019s ardent efforts as the group's fundraiser might not cut it next year if the U.S. and China remain locked in a trade war.",
      "With nearly all of the aerial shells, paper rockets and sparkly fountains that fuel America's Fourth of July celebrations being imported from China, volunteer groups like Johnson's and cities big and small have been closely watching the negotiations.",
      "A 90-day pause on what had been massive tariffs brought some temporary relief, but industry experts acknowledge that the tiff has lit a fuse of uncertainty as the price tag for future fireworks displays could skyrocket if an agreement isn\u2019t reached.",
      "There were similar concerns in 2019 as trade talks between the U.S. and China dragged on. Industry groups had called on officials then to exempt fireworks from escalating tariffs.",
      "The American Pyrotechnics Association and the National Fireworks Association reignited the lobbying effort this spring, noting in letters to President Donald Trump that fireworks play a crucial role in American celebrations. The groups say the industry is made up mostly of family-owned companies that are often locked into long-term contracts that leave them unable to raise prices to offset cost surges brought on by higher tariffs.",
      "And there are few options for sourcing the more than 300 million pounds (136 million kilograms) of fireworks needed to feed demands. China produces 99% of consumer fireworks and 90% of professional display fireworks used in the U.S., according to the APA.",
      "\u201cI think overall it\u2019s the uncertainty,\u201d said Julie Heckman, the APA's executive director. \u201cYeah, we have a 90-day pause, but are the negotiations with China going to go well? Or is it going to go sky-high again? You know, triple digits. It\u2019s very hard for a small business to plan.\"",
      "Fireworks have their roots in China. To ward off evil spirits, people would throw bamboo stalks into a fire, causing them to pop as the air inside the hollow pockets heated up. These early firecrackers evolved into more sophisticated fireworks after the Chinese developed gunpowder in the 9th century.",
      "By the 15th century, Europe was using fireworks for religious festivals and entertainment. In 1777, they were used in Philadelphia and Boston for what were the first organized Independence Day celebrations.",
      "Now, fireworks are synonymous with the summer holiday and with ringing in the new year. Shows have become elaborately choreographed displays that are often synced to live music. In Nashville, the Music City's award-winning symphony orchestra puts its own spin on the festivities.",
      "In New York City, organizers of the Macy's show will fire off 80,000 shells, with some reaching heights of 1,000 feet (304 meters). The National Park Service promises a spectacular show on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.",
      "At Elephant Butte in southern New Mexico, they're going old school and will light the fireworks by hand. Charlie Warren, vice president of the Friends of Elephant Butte Lake State Park, said it's like spectators are getting two shows at once as the colors reflect on the water below and the loud booms reverberate off the lake.",
      "Johnson, who also serves as the group's treasurer, gets emotional describing the experience.",
      "\u201cOh man, in my heart and sometimes out loud, I\u2019m singing the Star-Spangled Banner. I\u2019ll sing it out loud to the top of my lungs when I watch that show,\" she said. \u201cIt makes you proud to be in this country, and we\u2019re celebrating our freedom, and I\u2019m going to start crying now. Don\u2019t get me started.\u201d",
      "Organizers in Nashville ordered fireworks for that show over a year ago so they weren't affected by the tariffs. It was the same in one of New Mexico's largest cities, where Rio Rancho officials planned to spend a little more to go bigger and higher this year.",
      "In Oklahoma, Big Blast Fireworks supplies nonprofit groups so they can fundraise by setting up fireworks stands. The company received its first container from China in January before the tariffs hit. The second container arrived in February and was subject to a 10% tariff. The third container was put on hold to avoid the highest tariffs, meaning inventory could be tight later this year if nothing changes.",
      "\u201cAs a small business, we are passionate about watching our price points and intentional about passing along as much savings on to customers as possible,\" said Melissa Torkleson, a managing partner at Big Blast.",
      "With some orders on hold, industry experts say Chinese manufacturers throttled back production as warehouses filled up. The backup in the supply chain also has resulted in competition for shipping space aboard ocean vessels, and Heckman, the APA's director, said it will take much more than flipping a light switch to ease either situation.",
      "If the trade war drags on, she said, there are ways that show organizers can adjust and spectators might not notice. A minute or two could be shaved from a show or certain types of fireworks could be substituted with less expensive options.",
      "As for this year, Warren said the price tag for the Elephant Butte show was unchanged and he and Johnson can't wait to see spectators lining the shoreline, on the surrounding hillsides and on boats bobbing on the lake. The mission every year is to make sure \u201cthat the T's are all crossed,\" Warren said.",
      "\"Because this community would not be happy if this show didn\u2019t come off,\u201d he said.",

      "Child safety advocates are warning about the dangers of heatstroke from leaving kids in hot cars",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A record heat wave that spread across the East Coast of the United States during the first week of summer has child advocates warning parents and caretakers about the risks of heatstroke to children left inside hot vehicles.",
      "So far this year, nine children have died after being left unattended in vehicles in California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, New Jersey and North Carolina, according to Kids and Car Safety, which collects data on hot car deaths. Five died in June.",
      "And last year, 39 children in the U.S. died after being left in hot cars.",
      "Human-caused climate change keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists say. But the temperature outside doesn't have to be super hot for a child left in a vehicle to be affected by the heat, said Kathy Wall, director of Safe Kids Palm Beach County.",
      "\u201cInside, the vehicle can heat up 20 degrees in just 20 minutes,\u201d Wall said. \u201cSo if you imagine it\u2019s an 80 degree day, which in South Florida is a cool day, it could be over 100 degrees within 10 minutes inside the car.\"",
      "Hot car deaths can happen any time of year, and since 1998, every state but Alaska has reported a hot car death, according to the National Safety Council. In both 2018 and 2019, a record 53 children died after being left in hot cars.",
      "About 80% of the heat rise in vehicles happens in the first 30 minutes of a child being left inside, when maximum temperatures can exceed 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), according to data compiled by Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist at San Jose State University.",
      "\u201cChildren sweat a lot less than adults do and their internal temperature can increase three to five times faster than an adult. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s just as important to make sure that your child isn\u2019t left in the vehicle, especially during these rising temperatures,\" said Capt. Karen Derogatis of Palm Beach County Fire Rescue.",
      "While it\u2019s easy to place blame for leaving a child in a vehicle, even people trained to know the dangers have made that tragic mistake, Wall said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a socioeconomic group, it\u2019s not a cultural group,\u201d she said. \u201cThis sadly has happened to doctors, it\u2019s happened to dentists, it happened to school teachers, it\u2019s happened to child care workers. Nobody is exempt from this.\u201d",
      "Distraction often leads to forgetting about a child in the backseat, which is why it is important to create routines and reminders, she said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds crazy, but sometimes people get out of routines or are distracted, especially in today\u2019s world. There\u2019s lots going on in the news, lots going with families,\u201d she said.",
      "A parent who normally doesn't drop a child off at a day care facility might become distracted and forget that the child is in the vehicle, she said.",
      "She encourages parents and caregivers to establish routines.",
      "\u201cWe have an acronym, ACT,\" Wall said.",
      "A stands for avoiding leaving a child unattended in a vehicle.",
      "C stands for creating a reminder that works best for you. Authorities suggest leaving a personal item such as a purse or briefcase in the backseat so you'll have to open the back door before locking the vehicle.",
      "T is to take action right away. \u201cIf you see a child in a car, don\u2019t try to figure out how long they\u2019ve been in the car. Call 911 immediately,\" Wall said.",
      "Some newer cars offer warnings for drivers to check the backseat for passengers.",
      "Double checking the vehicle is key, said Derogatis, the fire captain.",
      "\"If you make it a common habit, just like you would look in their rear view mirror to see if somebody\u2019s behind you, or if you look at your side view mirror to see if you want to switch lanes, make it habit to look in your rearview mirror, whether you have a child or an animal or anything, just to ensure that they are as safe as possible,\u201d she said.",

      "A T-shirt worn by Beyonc\u00e9 during a Juneteenth performance on her \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d tour has sparked a discussion over how Americans frame their history and caused a wave of criticism for the Houston-born superstar.",
      "The T-shirt worn during a concert in Paris featured images of the Buffalo Soldiers, who belonged to Black U.S. Army units active during the late 1800s and early 1900s. On the back was a lengthy description of the soldiers that included \u201ctheir antagonists were the enemies of peace, order and settlement: warring Indians, bandits, cattle thieves, murderous gunmen, bootleggers, trespassers, and Mexican revolutionaries.\u201d",
      "Images of the shirt and videos of the performance are also featured on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s website.",
      "As she prepares to return to the U.S. for performances in her hometown this weekend, fans and Indigenous influencers took to social media to criticize Beyonc\u00e9 for wearing a shirt that frames Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries as anything but the victims of American imperialism and for promoting anti-Indigenous language.",
      "A spokesperson for Beyonc\u00e9 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Buffalo Soldiers served in six military units created after the Civil War in 1866. They were comprised of formerly enslaved men, freemen, and Black Civil War soldiers and fought in hundreds of conflicts \u2014 including in the Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II \u2014 until they were disbanded in 1951.",
      "As the quote on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s shirt notes, they also fought numerous battles against Indigenous peoples as part of the U.S. Army's campaign of violence and land theft during the country's westward expansion.",
      "Some historians say the moniker \u201cBuffalo Soldiers\u201d was bestowed by the tribes who admired the bravery and tenacity of the fighters, but that might be more legend than fact. \u201cAt the end of the day, we really don\u2019t have that kind of information,\u201d said Cale Carter, director of exhibitions at the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Houston.",
      "Carter and other museum staff said that, only in the past few years, the museum made broader efforts to include more of the complexities of the battles the Buffalo Soldiers fought against Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries and the role they played in the subjugation of Indigenous peoples. They, much like many other museums across the country, are hoping to add more nuance to the framing of American history and be more respectful of the ways they have caused harm to Indigenous communities.",
      "\u201cWe romanticize the Western frontier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe early stories that talked about the Buffalo Soldiers were impacted by a lot of those factors. So you really didn\u2019t see a changing in that narrative until recently.\u201d",
      "There has often been a lack of diverse voices discussing how the history of the Buffalo Soldiers is framed, said Michelle Tovar, the museum's director of education. The current political climate has put enormous pressure on schools, including those in Texas, to avoid honest discussions about American history, she said.",
      "\u201cRight now, in this area, we are getting pushback from a lot of school districts in which we can\u2019t go and teach this history,\" Tovar said. \"We are a museum where we can at least be a hub, where we can invite the community regardless of what districts say, invite them to learn it and do what we can do the outreach to continue to teach honest history.\u201d",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's recent album \u201cAct II: Cowboy Carter\u201d has played on a kind of American iconography, which many see as her way of subverting the country music genre's adjacency to whiteness and reclaiming the cowboy aesthetic for Black Americans. Last year, she became the first Black woman ever to top Billboard's country music chart, and \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d won her the top prize at the 2025 Grammy Awards, album of the year.",
      "\u201cThe Buffalo Soldiers play this major role in the Black ownership of the American West,\u201d said Tad Stoermer, a historian and professor at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIn my view, (Beyonc\u00e9 is) well aware of the role that these images play. This is the \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 tour for crying out loud. The entire tour, the entire album, the entire piece is situated in this layered narrative.\u201d",
      "But Stoermer also points out that the Buffalo Soldiers have been framed in the American story in a way that also plays into the myths of American nationalism.",
      "As Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of Buffalo Soldiers imagery implies, Black Americans also use their story to claim agency over their role in the creation of the country, said Alaina E. Roberts, a historian, author and professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studies the intersection of Black and Native American life from the Civil War to present day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the category in which she thought maybe she was coming into this conversation, but the Buffalo Soldiers are even a step above that because they were literally involved in not just the settlement of the West but of genocide in a sense,\u201d she said.",
      "Several Native influencers, performers, and academics took to social media this week to criticize Beyonc\u00e9 or decry the shirt's language as anti-Indigenous. \u201cDo you think Beyonc\u00e9 will apologize (or acknowledge) the shirt?\u201d indigenous.tv, an Indigenous news and culture Instagram account with more than 130,000 followers, asked in a post Thursday.",
      "Many of her critics, as well as fans, agree. A flood of social media posts called out the pop star for the historic framing on the shirt.",
      "\u201cThe Buffalo Soldiers are an interesting historical moment to look at. But we have to be honest about what they did, especially in their operations against Indigenous Americans and Mexicans,\u201d said Chisom Okorafor, who posts on TikTok under the handle @confirmedsomaya.",
      "Okorafor said there is no \u201cprogressive\u201d way to reclaim America's history of empire building in the West, and that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of Western symbolism sends a problematic message: \u201cThat Black people, too, can engage in American nationalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack people, too, can profit from the atrocities of (the) American empire,\u201d she said. \"It is a message that tells you to abandon immigrants, Indigenous people, and people who live outside of the United States. It is a message that tells you not only is it a virtue to have been born in this country, but the longer your line extends in this country, the more virtuous you are.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral campaign has piqued the interest of South Asians and Muslims in New York City and beyond",
      "The success of Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic primary for mayor is euphoric for Hari Kondabolu, a stand-up comedian who's been friends with the candidate for 15 years.",
      "Mamdani stunned the political establishment when he declared victory in the primary on Tuesday, a ranked choice election in which his strongest competition, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, conceded defeat.",
      "When he launched his campaign, the unabashed democratic socialist ranked near the bottom of the pack. Now, the 33-year-old state assemblyman has a chance to be New York City's first Asian American and Muslim mayor. Mamdani's family came to the United States when he was 7, and he became a citizen in 2018. He was born to Indian parents in Kampala, Uganda.",
      "For Kondabolu, this moment is not just exciting, but emotional.",
      "\u201cI think so many of us have had those experiences in New York of being brown and in a city that has always been really diverse and feels like ours. But after 9/11, like you start to question it like, is this our city too,\u201d Kondabolu said. \u201cAnd 25 years later ... it\u2019s surreal, like this is the same city but it\u2019s not because we\u2019ve elected this person.\u201d",
      "Mamdani's campaign has piqued the interest of many Indian, Pakistani and other South Asian Americans, as well as Muslims \u2014 even those who may not agree with Mamdani on every issue. Despite that opposition, some still see his rise as a sign of hope in a city where racism and xenophobia erupted following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",
      "Many of New York City's over 300,000 South Asian residents have been inspired by Mamdani\u2019s extraordinary trajectory.",
      "\u201cMy mom was texting her friends to vote for him. I\u2019ve never seen my mother do that before,\u201d Kondabolu said. \u201cSo the idea that it\u2019s gotten our whole family activated in this way \u2014 this is, like, personal.\u201d",
      "Snigdha Sur, founder and CEO of The Juggernaut, an online publication reporting on South Asians, has been fascinated by the response from some people in India and the diaspora.",
      "\u201cSo many global South Asians ... they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this guy is my mayor and I don\u2019t live in New York City,\u2019\u201d Sur said.",
      "At the same time, some are also concerned or angered by Mamdani's past remarks about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who he publicly called a \u201cwar criminal.\u201d",
      "In Michigan, Thasin Sardar has been following Mamdani\u2019s ascent online. When he first heard him, he struck him as \u201cgenuine\u201d and he felt \u201can instant connection,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs a Muslim American, this victory puts my trust back in the people,\u201d said Sardar, who was born and raised in India. \u201cI am happy that there are people who value the candidate and his policies more than his personal religious beliefs and didn\u2019t vote him down because of the color of his skin, or the fact that he was an immigrant with an uncommon name.\u201d",
      "New York voter Zainab Shabbir said family members in California, and beyond, have also excitedly taken note.",
      "\u201cMy family in California, they were very much like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s so nice to see a South Asian Muslim candidate be a mayor of a major city,\u2019\u201d she said. A brother told her Mamdani\u2019s rise is a great example for his kids, she said.",
      "But the 34-year-old \u2014 who donated, voted and canvassed for Mamdani \u2014 said it was his vision for New York City that was the draw for her. She and her husband briefly chatted with Mamdani at a fundraiser and she found him to be \u201cvery friendly and genuine.\u201d",
      "She suspects that for some who aren\u2019t very politically active, Mamdani\u2019s political ascent could make a difference.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Muslim communities like my parents\u2019 generation who are focused a lot more on the politics back home and less on the politics here in America,\u201d said Shabbir. \u201cSeeing people like Zohran Mamdani be in office, it\u2019ll really change that perspective in a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Supporters and pundits agree that Mamdani's campaign has demonstrated social media savvy and authenticity. He visited multiple mosques. In videos, he speaks in Hindi or gives a touch of Bollywood. Other South Asian American politicians such as Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna praised that.",
      "\u201cI love that he didn\u2019t run away from his heritage. I mean, he did video clips with Amitabh Bachchan and Hindi movies,\u201d Khanna said, referencing the Indian actor. \u201cHe shows that one can embrace their roots and their heritage and yet succeed in American politics.\u201d",
      "But his triumph also reflects \u201cthe urgency of the economic message, the challenge that people are facing in terms of rent, in terms of the cost of living, and how speaking to that is so powerful,\u201d the progressive California Democrat added.",
      "Tanzeela Rahman, a daughter of Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh, said she grew up \u201cvery low income\u201d in New York.",
      "\u201cI felt seen by him in a way politicians have not seen me ever,\u201d the 29-year-old financial systems analyst said. \u201cI think very few people in government understand \u2026 how hard it is to survive in New York City.\u201d",
      "She found Mamdani to be \u201cunabashedly Muslim\u201d and also \u201ca voice, who, literally, to me sounds like a New Yorker who\u2019s stepping in and saying, hey, let\u2019s reclaim our power,\u201d she said.",
      "While Mamdani has been speaking to the working class, he had a somewhat privileged upbringing. His mother is filmmaker Mira Nair and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University.",
      "He lived in Queens but attended The Bronx High School of Science. Even as a teen, he cared about social justice, Kondabolu, the comedian, recalled.",
      "His campaign messaging on issues such as affordable housing and free bus rides might not resonate with South Asian households in New York City who have income levels above the median. But, the irony is that his campaign and \u201cgreat kind of soundbites\u201d earned support from that demographic, too, according to Sur.",
      "\u201cIt was, I think, a surprise that he did so well among the wealthiest, including his own community,\u201d Sur said.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s outspoken support for Palestinian causes and criticism of Israel and its military campaign in Gaza resonated with pro-Palestinian residents, including Muslims, but caused tension in the mayor\u2019s race. Some of his positions and remarks on the charged issue have drawn recriminations from opponents and some Jewish groups, though he\u2019s also been endorsed by some Jewish politicians and activists.",
      "Mamdani's success immediately elicited strong anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric from some high-profile conservatives on social media, including conservative media personality Charlie Kirk who posted that \u201clegal immigration can ruin your country.\u201d In response, Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost, the youngest member of Congress, tweeted \u201cFor years they sold people the lie of \u2018we have no problem if you come the right way!\u2019\u201d",
      "His supporters aren't concerned that racism and Islamophobia will distract from Mamdani's campaign. Those feelings clearly weren't \u201cenough for him to lose\u201d the primary, Kondabolu said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a new generation that wants their voice heard and that generation came out in full force, not just by voting, but by, like, getting all these other people to be emotionally invested in this candidate,\u201d Kondabolu said. \u201cThat\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d",

      "At first, the school district allowed parents to opt their children out of the lessons for religious and other reasons, but the district later reversed course, saying it became disruptive. The move prompted protests and eventually a lawsuit.",

      "A California Energy Commission official is recommending a pause on Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to penalize oil companies if their profits climb too high",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California should pause Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to penalize oil companies if their profits climb too high, a top energy regulator said Friday while unveiling proposals aimed at addressing high gas prices.",
      "The Democratic governor signed a law in 2023 giving the California Energy Commission the authority to penalize oil companies for excess profits, declaring the state had \u201cfinally beat big oil.\u201d More than two years later, the commission hasn't imposed a single penalty or determined what counts as an excessive profit.",
      "Now, Siva Gunda, the energy commission's vice-chair, says the state should pause the effort in favor of pursuing other policies to lower prices and maintain a steady oil supply \u2014 all while pushing to phase out reliance on fossil fuels over the next two decades.",
      "\u201cTogether, we will evolve California\u2019s strategy to successfully phase out petroleum-based fuels by 2045 while protecting communities, workers, and consumers, and foster market conditions that support the industry\u2019s ability to operate safely, reliably, and successfully to meet demand through the transition,\u201d Gunda wrote in a letter to Newsom.",
      "Gunda's recommended pause of the penalty would have to be agreed upon by the full commission. Newsom has pitched the penalty as a way to rein in profits by oil companies, but critics said it would only raise prices.",
      "California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.61 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.",
      "The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance, Gunda said. That proposal came out of a law Newsom signed last year after convening a special session aimed at preventing gas price spikes.",
      "Gunda's recommendations come months after Newsom in April directed energy regulators to work with refiners on plans to ensure the state maintains a reliable fuel supply as it transitions away from fossil fuels.",

Phillips 66 announced plans to shut down its Los Angeles-area refinery, and Valero said it would cease operations at its Benicia refinery. The two refineries combined account for more than 17% of the state's refining capacity, according to the energy commission.",

      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed on Friday a bipartisan budget that boosts pay for first responders and increases spending on social services, capping a quarrelsome session of the Republican-led Legislature that brought the state to the brink of a government shutdown.",
      "The first-term Democrat broke her veto record, sparred with Republicans over agency leadership nominations and got on board with bipartisan proposals that ruffled the feathers of some members of her party. The session unfolded while Hobbs\u2019 2026 bid to hold the reins of the battleground state loomed large.",
      "Hobbs began the session with an uphill climb, confronting expanded Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Arizona is one of eight states where the governor\u2019s office and legislature are controlled by opposing parties.",
      "Hobbs' office chose to negotiate on just a handful of issues this session, including water policy, funding for some of Arizona's most vulnerable residents and renovations to a stadium used by the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
      "The Legislature sent the governor a $17.6 billion budget after GOP lawmakers traded barbs with each other and Hobbs' office. The Senate approved one version, but it lacked votes in the House, leaving lawmakers in that chamber to introduce a measure meant to keep state operations running while negotiations continued.",
      "On Wednesday, Hobbs vetoed the proposal favored by House Republicans and the continuation measure, calling them partisan and reckless.",
      "House Speaker Steve Montenegro introduced amendments to the budget proposal Thursday, and the chamber passed it that night, clearing the way for the Senate to sign off.",
      "\u201cOur principles haven\u2019t changed. We\u2019ve led responsibly in a divided government, fought to preserve conservative priorities, and made this budget better than it would have been without us,\u201d Montenegro said in a statement Friday.",

The act requires detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crime. Hobbs' stance drew praise from GOP Senate President Warren Petersen, while members of her own party criticized the measure.",
      "She signed an executive order in February to create a task force that would oversee expanded operations at the border, but she later vetoed a measure that would have required local and state officials to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Priya Sundareshan, a Democrat, said her caucus pushed Hobbs to limit spending on border support, saying it had \u201cdrawn a hard line\u201d and planned to withhold votes on the state budget until the border funding was reduced.",
      "Democratic Senate Assistant Minority Leader Sen. Catherine Miranda, who voted against the budget, said last week that she could not support a budget that has language that opens the door to immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cAnd while I know that Gov. Hobbs has promised she will not use the Local Border Support Fund to enforce immigrant laws, the language included in a bill has as much impact as the actual policy implementation,\u201d Miranda said.",
      "Progressive lobbyist Marilyn Rodriguez said she would have liked to see Hobbs take a less hawkish posture on border security.",
      "Despite some frustrations, House Democratic Leader Oscar De Los Santos said the budget delivers on priorities that include public education, Medicaid and expanded health care for certain patients.",
      "\u201cWe also make big investments to bring down the cost of childcare and make college tuition free for Arizona's students from working families,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Hobbs is no stranger to the veto pen, which she has wielded to knock down what she considers proposals that are out of touch with the state\u2019s purple electorate. This year, she vetoed about 170 bills, including an attempt to speed up the counting of ballots.",
      "She\u2019s repeatedly accused state Sen. Jake Hoffman, who chairs the Legislature\u2019s Freedom Caucus, for politicizing the confirmations of her agency head nominees.",
      "Her fight with Republicans over funding for a state agency that provides services for some of Arizona\u2019s most vulnerable residents led to a moratorium on bill signing, and she has criticized Republicans for hitting the breaks on a proposal that could have led to increased regulation of groundwater pumping in rural areas of the drought-stricken state.",
      "Hobbs has said she'd take action on the water front in the absence of a legislative deal, which could set up another round of sparring with Republican lawmakers as she prepares to seek another term.",
      "With no Democratic challenger, Hobbs is expected to face either Karrin Taylor Robson or U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, who are both endorsed by the president.",

      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs has signed legislation that provides public funding to renovate Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed legislation Friday that funds up to $500 million in renovations to Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
      "The bill, which won bipartisan support in both of the state's GOP-controlled chambers, will use sales tax revenue from the stadium and nearby buildings for infrastructure upgrades over the next 30 years, including improvements to air conditioning systems and the stadium\u2019s retractable roof.",
      "The team said it will also contribute $250 million for the renovations at the stadium, which is located in downtown Phoenix and is surrounded by small businesses and restaurants that see a boost of activity during the baseball season.",
      "The legislation is one of a handful of bipartisan deals that Hobbs, a Democrat, prioritized negotiating during the session. She says the funding is a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, will provide good-paying jobs and ensure the Diamondbacks do not leave Phoenix.",
      "Attendance at games has increased since the team's 2023 run to the World Series, where the Diamondbacks lost to the Texas Rangers. This season they are averaging 31,420 fans per game \u2014 the highest in two decades.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to let Arizona lose the Diamondbacks,\u201d Hobbs said Friday on the social platform X.",
      "Derrick Hall, president and CEO of the Diamondbacks, praised the governor and said the team will now turn its attention to extending its lease with Maricopa County.",
      "The bill cleared the Legislature June 23 after months of debate that included the question of whether the Diamondbacks could potentially leave unless a public funding deal was reached.",
      "Other MLB teams have threatened to leave host cities if they did not get public financing.",
      "The Oakland A's, for example, complained for years about the Oakland Coliseum and an inability to gain government assistance for a new ballpark. Now the team is bound for Las Vegas, where a groundbreaking ceremony was held this month for a $1.75 billion ballpark that is expected to be completed in time for the 2028 season. Nevada and Clark County approved up to $380 million in public funds for the project.",
      "And last year voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected an attempt to extend a sales tax that would have helped fund a ballpark for the Kansas City Royals and stadium renovations for the Kansas City Chiefs. Lawmakers in Kansas are trying to lure the teams with government subsidies, and Missouri is trying to keep them with its own financial incentives.",
      "The Diamondbacks have spent nearly three decades in their downtown ballpark, which is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District. In 2017, the team sued the district over funding for repairs and sought to remove a contractual clause preventing the team from looking into other stadium options.",
      "A perennial problem has been the park's air conditioning system and its ability to keep it cool in triple-digit summer heat, Hall said. Fans of country music star Morgan Wallen bemoaned the heat at a concert there last July, despite the retractable roof being closed. Concession stands ran out of water, and some people simply left.",
      "Chase Field was one of the first MLB stadiums to have a retractable roof. Now seven out of the 30 teams play under one, including the Brewers, Blue Jays, Rangers, Marlins, Astros and Mariners. Chase Field also has a small swimming pool in right field, one of its most recognizable features.",
      "The funding from the Legislature will not mean upgrades to the pool or to stadium suites, the latter of which was a sticking point for Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. She got on board after the bill was updated to prevent funds from being used for suites and a cap was placed on how much money the city would contribute for a land deal should the Diamondbacks break from the Stadium District, according to Gallego chief of staff Seth Scott.",
      "Hobbs is running for reelection, and while it's too early to say whether the Diamondbacks funding will be part of her campaign messaging, it's another bipartisan win, her communications director Michael Beyer said.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Mitzi Epstein, who voted against the funding, said Hobbs' support for the bill was wrong and hurtful for Arizonans. She said she was disappointed that amendments to create public benefits such as free streaming of games failed.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "Attorneys claim Harbaugh, who was Michigan's coach, and others knew that Matt Weiss was seen viewing private information on a computer in December 2022 but still allowed him to continue working as co-offensive coordinator in a national playoff game roughly a week later.",
      "Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel and other officials were also added to the lawsuit in federal court in Detroit.",
      "\u201cThe university's delay in taking meaningful protective action until after a high-stakes game sends a clear message: Student welfare was secondary,\u201d said Parker Stinar, who is the lead lawyer in a class-action lawsuit arising from a criminal investigation of Weiss.",
      "Messages seeking comment from Manuel and Harbaugh, who is currently the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, were not immediately returned Friday.",
      "Separately, Weiss has been charged with identity theft and unauthorized computer access from 2015 to 2023. The indictment says he got access to the social media, email and cloud storage accounts of more than 2,000 college athletes, as well as more than 1,300 students or alumni from schools across the U.S., to find private images, primarily of women. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "\u201cHad Harbaugh implemented basic oversight of his staff, plaintiffs and the class would have been protected against predators such as Weiss,\u201d the updated lawsuit states. \u201cInstead, Weiss was a highly compensated asset that was promoted by and within the football program, from which position he was able to, and did, target female student athletes.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says a staff member saw Weiss viewing private information at Schembechler Hall, headquarters for the football team, around Dec. 21, 2022, and reported it before Michigan played Texas Christian University in a playoff game days later on Dec. 31.",
      "Weiss was fired a few weeks later in January 2023 during an investigation of his computer use.",
      "Earlier this year, after charges were filed, Harbaugh told reporters that he didn't know anything about Weiss' troubles until after the playoff game. He said the allegations were \"shocking.\"",
      "Weiss worked for Harbaugh's brother, John, on the coaching staff of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens before joining the Michigan team in 2021.",
      "The lawsuit says Weiss\u2019 university computer had encryption software that had to be disabled by an external vendor as part of the investigation. Authorities disclosed in April that thousands of intimate photos and videos were found on his electronic devices and cloud storage accounts.",

      "Traffic backed up for 12 miles (about 19 kilometers) along the West Virginia Turnpike about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Charleston, the state capital. Traffic was not rerouted, and many motorists along the mountainous route had no choice but to remain in their vehicles overnight.",

      "\"I feel good about the movie,\" he said. \"And I'm excited about that. And I think we've done something that's different.\"",
      "Among those differences: \"My Superman is not indestructible,\" Gunn said. \"We see him bleed, immediately. At times, I've thought, 'He's too strong.' You don't want him to be able to punch a planet in half or, for that matter, go around a planet a billion times and make time go backwards, you know? I wanted a Superman who was a little bit more down-to-Earth.\"",
      "And few things are more down-to-Earth than a dog. \"The dog is the whole reason \u2013 [it] was the start of the movie for me, a thousand percent,\" Gunn said. \"I adopted a dog. His name is Ozu. And he didn't want to be touched, he had never known human beings. He chewed up all our furniture. He was, you know, chasing the cat, and just being the worst dog you can imagine. And I thought, 'Wow. What if this terrible dog had super powers? I'd really be screwed!'\"",
      "The first Superman feature film came in 1951 with George Reeves, who later played the role on TV. In this century, Superman has been played by Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill. But in the last 75 years, only one big screen Superman has fully captured the audience's imagination: Christopher Reeve.",
      "Trained in the theater, Reeve was a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York \u2013 as is the new Superman, David Corenswet. He is 31 \u2013 seven years older than Reeve was when he made his debut in 1978. \"I don't think there's any way or reason to try to sort of live up to Christopher Reeve,\" Corenswet said. \"I just feel grateful to get to play that character that he embodied and put into the public consciousness in such a positive and strong way.\"",
      "We met Corenswet at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia. It's Corenswet's hometown, where he still lives, and it's at the Arden where he landed his first paid gig, when he was nine years old: \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller.",
      "Like his Superman, Corenswet is immediately disarming, as well as vulnerable, as in a scene with Superman's girlfriend, reporter Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan).",
      "\"He is definitively different from everybody else on Earth,\" Corenswet said. \"He is not human. He's an alien, and he has these powers that nobody else has. And at the same time, he wants desperately to be a part of humanity. So ultimately, the dramatic stakes of Superman as a character is that he is lonely and he doesn't want to be.\"",
      "He also has a sense of humor about those red shorts. \"Without the trunks, the uniform can look very military,\" Corenswet said. \"So he puts the red underwear on, a) so that everybody can see him, against the blue sky you can see the red trunks, b) so that everybody knows he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's not trying to look cool.",
      "\"Now, that doesn't in any way undermine how badass and cool he is when he's up in the sky fighting the bad guys. But once he touches down, he wants to be the one that people can laugh or make fun of, because he can take it.\"",
      "Superman has been saving the world for nearly nine decades. Created by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster, he first appeared in a comic in 1938.",
      "Asked if Superman represents the signature American movie character, critic and filmmaker Elvis Mitchell said, \"I think he's bigger than that. Spider-Man is tortured. You know, he has to support himself and his aunt, and he's responsible for the death of his uncle. And Batman's responsible for the death of everybody in his line of sight. They're all sufferers.",
      "\"But Superman, he stands tall, and there's a pride of authorship, literally, in the character. 'Cause he's creating his own narrative as his alter ego. People want to see that. They want to believe that you can create your own narrative in a way that is benevolent, even if you have all the power in the world. It's wrong of you to turn away from people who need your help.\"",
      "Asked what he wants audiences around the world to take away from his Superman, Gunn said, \"I think, just culturally, being able to place a little bit more importance on being a good human being. I think we're surrounded by a lot of meanness. I think Superman is surrounded by a lot of meanness in the movie. But he stands against that grain. And that's what makes him rebellious.",
      "\"And in a way, I think today, in today's world, Superman's the edgier, more rebellious character because he's the one who's standing up for the values that most people are not,\" he said.",
      "Corenswet is embracing the challenge, fully aware that success could mean Superman defines his career. He said, \"When you take a role that's gonna be this visible and this iconic, even just visually iconic, and it's your face and the underwear, yeah, I wanted to be prepared for the possibility that it wouldn't lead to a bunch of other things, that this would be the thing.",
      "\"And I felt really lucky that when I asked myself that question the answer came back, somebody's gotta play this part, and if you're the person to play it and you give up everything else to do it, it would be worth doing.\"",

      "A charge of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin was dismissed at trial last year on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Separately, \"Rust\" armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March 2024.

      "Attorney Marc Agnifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began his four-hour presentation Friday in a New York courtroom.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",
      "He said prosecutors had \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes to combine it with recreational drug use and call it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Agnifilo said of Combs: \"He sits there innocent. Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "The lawyer argued prosecutors had invaded Combs' most intimate personal affairs, telling jurors: \"Where's the crime scene? It's your sex life.\"",
      "Agnifilo also argued there's another factor at play in the allegations that women have lobbed against Combs: the prospect of draining him of his wealth through lawsuits.",
      "\"This isn't about crime. It's about money. This is about money,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said Agnifilo had spent \"a whole lot of energy\" trying to distract from Combs' \"inexcusable behavior.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" Comey told jurors, \"this trial was about how in Sean Combs' world, 'no' was never an option.\"",
      "In his closing argument, Agnifilo reiterated that the defense \"owns\" the fact that Combs was violent but argued that behavior does not justify the grave charges against him.",
      "Combs and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine\u00a0had a \"loving, beautiful relationship,\" albeit a \"complicated\" one, Agnifilo said. \"If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,\" Agnifilo said. \"They were deeply in love with each other.\"",
      "In her rebuttal, Comey said, \"Being a domestic abuser is not a defense to sex trafficking.\"",
      "Jurors are expected to begin deliberating on Monday.",
      "Combs' family, including six of his children and his mother, were in the audience for the defense's closing, which took place a day after the prosecution made its closing arguments Thursday \u2014 after calling on 34 witnesses over the course of seven weeks. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Ventura Fine, and rapper\u00a0Kid Cudi, were among those who testified.",
      "The trial of Combs, 55, began on May 12. Prosecutors allege he relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in \u2014 or attempted to engage in \u2014 \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "Combs has denied the allegations against him and\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Combs has been present at the trial but told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian earlier this week that he decided not to testify.",
      "\"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it,\" he said.",
      "The defense\u00a0rested\u00a0on Tuesday after presenting its case for less than 30 minutes. It didn't call any witnesses.",

      "In federal prosecutors' closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said to the jury that Combs used \"power, violence and fear\" to rule a criminal enterprise, which allegedly facilitated brutal sex crimes. Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",

      "Schifrin's son, Ryan Schifrin, confirmed the death to CBS News in a statement, saying his father \"succumbed to complications from pneumonia.\"",
      "\"His family was at his side, and he passed peacefully,\" Schifrin said. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to be there for him. We are still trying to process this loss, and are very moved by all the love and support we have received.\"",

The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",

      "Schifrin's composition of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme",
      "But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television's \"Mission: Impossible,\" which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \"only the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\" by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song, but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \"So I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin's music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin's music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\"I remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\" Giacchino told NPR. \"And I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, 'Just have fun with it.' And I did.\"",
      "\"Mission: Impossible\" won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996's first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand's Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Schifrin's background and his other prolific work",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band.",
      "Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie's quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \"Gillespiana.\"",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\" while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour\" and its two sequels, \"Bringing Down The House,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" \"After the Sunset\" and the horror film \"Abominable.\"",
      "Writing the arrangements for \"Dirty Harry,\" Schifrin decided that the main character wasn't in fact Clint Eastwood's hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\"You would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\" he told the AP. \"I wrote a theme for Scorpio.\"",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin said at the time. \"It is mission accomplished.\"",
      "Among Schifrin's conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California's Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \"Christmas in Vienna\" in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \"Letters from Argentina,\" nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event's 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \"Songs of the Aztecs.\" The work premiered at Mexico's Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site's Aztec temple.",
      "\"I found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \"But the real answer is that there's something magic about it. ... There's something magic in the art of music anyway.\"",

      "Her sixth album, \"Princess of Power,\" comes after the artist \u2014 born Marina Diamandis \u2014 recovered from chronic fatigue syndrome while rebuilding her relationship with music and her identity.",
      "MARINA has scored billions of streams without ever having a top 10 single in the U.K. or U.S., yet her influence runs deep among a generation of artists including Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish. \"I think artists who are very commercially successful, like they'll have these peaks and troughs and mine's kind of like been like steadily going up,\" MARINA said.",
      "Although she admitted it's \"somewhat frustrating\" when music doesn't reach mainstream success, her dedicated fanbase never fails to find it.",
      "\"I always want people to choose to love my music. I don't want to shove it in anyone's face,\" she said.",
      "The origins of MARINA's journey",
      "The daughter of a Welsh mother and Greek father, MARINA moved from her hometown of Abergavenny, Wales, to London at 19. She was initially embarrassed to sing in public \u2014 but music felt like an \"innate calling.\"",
      "She overcame her stage fright \"painfully\" by going to open mic nights alone.",
      "\"I was like, if I'm bad, I need no one I know to see me be bad, which you can't do anymore, 'cause everyone's filming everything,\" she said, laughing.",
      "She launched her career with her 2010 debut \"The Family Jewels,\" then going by Marina and the Diamonds, followed by 2012's \"Electra Heart,\" which reached No. 1 on British charts.\u00a0But by 2016, success felt suffocating.",
      "\"And I just suddenly felt really trapped,\" she said. \"I felt like my identity was glued to my artist's identity. I just suddenly, like wanted out.\"",
      "Discovering health issues",
      "That same year, MARINA began experiencing mysterious symptoms that would later be diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome.",
      "\"The main symptom actually was buzzing all over,\" she explained. \"And it always started in my feet then it would basically go all the way up my body \u2026 like my face would basically be throbbing. Like my whole body would feel like it was ringing.\"",
      "It took six years to understand the condition was connected to her nervous system. Breathwork ultimately provided relief.",
      "\"I have had to basically change my whole life, like inside out,\" she said.",
      "While MARINA stepped back from her career, her early music found new life on TikTok.",
      "\"It is strange because I was so used to like pushing to make things happen in my career. And then suddenly this whole thing, you get three platinum records by doing nothing,\" she said.",
      "Now living in Los Angeles, MARINA approaches each album with detailed planning, usually in a journal. But this time, she made an album map for \"Princess of Power\" which includes a color palette, themes and the kind of energy she wanted the music to have: cosmic, love rush, euphoric, dazzling, bright light and powerful.",
      "\"This album was different because I think I'm at the point where I'm not writing so much to like heal myself,\" she said. \"I was like, I have this platform, and I want to make sure that whatever I'm putting out into the world has a certain type of energy that feels positive to me \u2026 because that's what I really needed two years ago when I started writing this.\"",
      "\"You don't get to do this many times in your life, you know, as an artist,\" she continued. \"So, I was like, this is the time I'm gonna do this. Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Performing these new songs allows MARINA to embody the transformation she's undergone.",
      "\"It's almost like making it public means I can suddenly step into it,\" she said. \"It's almost like I can finally say to people, 'This is who I am actually.' Like the person you knew four years ago has gone.\"",
      "That transformation represents more than recovery, it's a reclamation of her power.",

    "story": [
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" has died, his wife said in a statement posted to social media. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

Two former girlfriends, including\u00a0Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura\u00a0and a woman using the pseudonym \"Jane\" took the stand and told the jury they did not want to participate in so-called \"freak offs,\" described as drug fueled sexual encounters with male escorts they said Combs would direct.",

      "The other four counts are sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "\"I think they've proved that prostitutes were moved from one state to another and that Diddy was involved,\" Schoenstein said.",
      "Schoenstein said the other counts are more debatable.",
      "\"Sex trafficking by force, and that's going to be more of an assessment of what the relationships between Diddy and Cassie and what Diddy and Jane were like and what the jury thinks of all that,\" Schoenstein said.",

      "The trial is in its seventh week.\u00a0A juror was dismissed as the prosecution neared the end of its case over questions about where that juror actually lived. And rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, stopped by the trial to observe the proceedings briefly at one point.",

    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-us-funding-gavi-vaccine-alliance-travesty-experts-warn/",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:32:21 -0400",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is hiring Lyn Redwood, a nurse and the former head of a group critics have denounced as anti-vaccine, to work in its vaccine safety office, multiple CDC officials tell CBS News.",
      "Redwood was the president of the group now called Children's Health Defense, which lists as its founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now oversees the CDC as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Health Defense has sued to curb vaccine requirements, petitioned federal agencies to revoke vaccine authorizations and spread misinformation about vaccines. Kennedy was listed as the group's founder and chairman before becoming the nation's top health official in the second Trump administration.",
      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",
      "Redwood is expected to be hired as a special government employee, the CDC officials said, a status often afforded to advisers and other temporary experts brought on for specific projects or committees.",
      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",
      "Redwood said she had worked with one of the heads of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office in the past over her concerns about mercury in vaccines.",
      "\"I was so naive. I really thought that they would take immediate action, and that they would stop these exposures,\" she said.",

    "summary": "He's the son of an immigrant family who fled Tehran and the Iranian revolution. He's also the chief executive officer of Uber. He talks about the road to high-tech success, and about unsettling times for a nation of immigrants.",
    "story": [
      "It's rare to sit down with a CEO and the CEO's mother. The proud mom is Lili Khosrowshahi; her son, Dara, is behind the wheel at Uber as its chief executive. \"I actually say he works for Uber,\" said Lili. \"Sometimes I say he drives, he's a driver.\"",
      "They sat down with us to share their family's immigration story. In 1978, the Khosrowshahis fled Tehran and the Iranian revolution. \"We were forced to leave Iran \u2013 it wasn't our decision,\" Lili said. \"It was done in a day.\"",
      "Dara's father ran a family business which made them wealthy, but also, they say, a target. \"You don't sit around saying, 'Well, let's plan as a family for a revolution,' right? It just never occurs to you,\" Dara said. \"We lost everything.\"",
      "\"We came from a much better life to a smaller life,\" said Lili. \"At the time, coffee was 15 cents, and I wouldn't even buy a cup of coffee. In fact, I don't pay for Starbucks coffee to this day.\"",
      "\"Mama, Starbucks is a customer of Uber Eats. You gotta talk it up!\" Dara interjected. \"I love Starbucks, personally!\"",
      "\"I'll let you pay,\" said Mom.",
      "It's that easy-going, yet strategic tone that Khosrowshahi brought to Uber. Launched in 2009, the company transformed how millions get around. When Khosrowshahi took charge in 2017, Uber was infamous for a toxic work culture and a growth-at-all-costs approach.",
      "When he took over, his job was described as \"one of the worst clean-up jobs in the history of American capitalism.\"",
      "\"Well, I think it was a little over-dramatized,\" said Khosrowshahi. \"But it was true that I had to come in and change the culture of the company. And I do think that the company, in hindsight, was too aggressive in certain ways. And I think now we get it right more than we get it wrong.\"",
      "Still, Uber is defending itself in lawsuits over its billing practices and passenger safety.",
      "Then, there's the company's relationship with President Donald Trump. Eight years ago, Khosrowshahi was CEO of Expedia \u2013 and condemned Mr. Trump's so-called Muslim ban. Today, he's one of many CEOs now engaging with President Trump.",
      "\"I do think that, as a CEO of a U.S. company, you want the country to succeed,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And so, that means supporting whatever administration is in power. You're gonna have your disagreements. You're gonna have your agreements. We have to navigate through a period of a strong economy, but at the same time, significant uncertainty.\"",
      "I asked, \"Isn't a lot of that uncertainty caused by this president?\"",
      "\"Uncertainty comes with change,\" he replied. \"And I think the president ran on a mandate for change. As CEOs, as companies, you know, we have to adjust to that environment that we see.\"",
      "And Uber is adjusting. Last month it announced new, cheaper ride options. Route Share matches riders with other passengers along pre-set commutes.",
      "\"This feels kind of like a glorified carpool?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, what is old is new again,\" said Khosrowshahi.",
      "\"We have heard from a lot of riders that Uber rides have gotten a lot more expensive over the past few years, more than the rate of inflation \u2013 what's happening here?\"",
      "\"Well, I think it is about inflation,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And the average Uber ride is now a little over $20. Our drivers need to make a living, and so really the demand for drivers and pay has gone up, and that translates into the ultimate price of the Uber ride.\"",
      "Concerns over driver pay and benefits persist \u2026 even as Khosrowshahi's own compensation has surged, to about $40 million a year.",
      "Asked what people should make of that, Khosrowshahi said, \"We as a society, I think as a country, clearly, we've done unbelievably well economically. But I do think that the inequality that you see as it relates to the top end compensation, like someone who's lucky enough like me, and the middle class, et cetera, that is too big a chasm, in my opinion.\"",
      "Too big of a gap? \"Yeah. I do think it's too big of a gap. Now, I don't have a solution for it.\"",
      "It's a gap that may be getting even bigger.",
      "This past week, Uber expanded its robotaxi service to Atlanta, launching rides in self-driving Waymos.",
      "Khosrowshahi said, \"Everyone wants on-demand transportation, food, et cetera. So, we see actually AV [Autonomous Vehicle] and human driving can grow for the next five to 10 years.\"",
      "\"You don't think human driver numbers will decrease?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not in the next five to 10 years,\" he replied. \"Then, we will need to adjust as a society.\"",
      "For now, robotaxis are neither cheaper nor faster than a human driver. But Khosrowshahi says they are as safe as can be. \"Certainly the statistics bear it out,\" he said.",
      "Khosrowshahi is focused on the road ahead, but his past is never far behind. When he was a teen, his father returned to Iran for what he thought would be a short visit \u2026 but the government wouldn't let him leave.",
      "Lili said, \"For the six years that your father was away, you never even mentioned his name. And I told you that Daddy was free to come, and you started crying like crazy. I mean, you couldn't stop crying. So, you know, you had learned to just hide your feelings. But as immigrants, we all learned to hide our feelings.\"",
      "Emotional, Dara requested a break from the interview. \"I don't remember the particular moment,\" he said. \"but I remember the time. And I think, you know, Mom's totally right. You adjust to the situation to your best.\"",
      "\"Adjust\" \u2026 Dara Khosrowshahi keeps coming back to that word, in work and in life.",
      "I asked, \"You have said, 'We came at a time that was welcoming to immigrants.' Is that still the case right now?\"",
      "\"I think, you know, we're going through a transition now as a nation,\" he replied. \"There's a reset going on in terms of making sure that immigration here is proper, is legal. It's difficult for a lot of people. But my hope is that we remain the kind of country that attracts the best and the brightest who want to build a life here. And  hopefully, I can help others live the same dream that I have.\"",

      "The higher minimum wages come as the federal baseline rate remains at $7.25 an hour, where it's been parked since 2009. As the cost of living has crept higher in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have boosted their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are continually encouraged to sock away money in a 401(k) or other retirement plan to ensure a comfortable, if not cushy, life in their later years. Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds.",
      "About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found.",
      "The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings\u00a0to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings.",
      "\"Deeply unequal\"",
      "\"Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,\" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"Nearly half of private sector workers \u2014 56 million people \u2014 lack access to workplace retirement plans. When we include gig, cash and many public-sector workers, the number grows to a staggering 83 million. That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis.\"",
      "About 70% of all U.S. retirement assets are held in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, including 401(k)s and pensions, as well as in government-sponsored plans, the Congressional Research Service found in a 2023\u00a0analysis. The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.",
      "While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month.",
      "\"To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,\" Pew noted in its analysis. \"Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks.\"",
      "Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans.",
      "Creaking Social Security system",
      "While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted.",
      "\"What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,\" she said.",
      "Ghilarducci added, \"Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving.\"",
      "The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary \u2014 or even only \u2014 source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast.",
      "At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income.",
      "Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security.",
      "\"The Pew report is a wake-up call,\" Ghilarducci said. \"If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it \u2014 workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages.\"",

    "summary": "Economists warned that a barrage of new U.S. tariffs could trigger a renewed bout of inflation. So why aren't prices surging?",
    "story": [
      "Despite concerns earlier this year that President Trump's tariffs would cause a renewed bout of inflation, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have remained relatively stable.",
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.3% in May, modestly above the central bank's 2% annual target. The May Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, cooler than economists expected.",
      "The muted inflation data reflects short-term steps taken by some companies to offset the tariff impact, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing the cost of some tariffs to cushion consumers from price hikes, and leveraging loopholes to delay or lower duty payments, economists say.",
      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "summary": "New federal data showed that inflation edged up in May, but U.S. prices show only modest impact from U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, inched higher in May, the latest sign that inflation remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target.",
      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, according to the PCE data. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, up from a rate of 2.5% the previous month.",
      "While inflation ticked higher, prices across the U.S. haven't yet shown a major impact from the Trump administration's tariffs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned earlier this week that inflation could reignite this summer as the import duties are passed through to consumers.",
      "Consumers also pared their spending last month, marking their first reduction since January, while incomes also dropped, the Commerce Department\u00a0said\u00a0on Friday. The pullback in spending, which dropped 0.1% last month, comes after Americans opened their wallets earlier in the year to buy goods before the tariffs took effect, economists said.",
      "\"While the spending numbers fell slightly and came in below expectations, we would not read too much into these numbers as this weakness is probably primarily just payback from the jump in spending earlier this year as consumers tried to buy goods ahead of the tariffs,\" Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. fixed income and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Incomes dropped after a one-time adjustment to Social Security benefits had boosted payments in March and April. Social Security payments were raised for some retirees who had worked for state and local governments due to the Social Security Fairness Act.",
      "Modest impact from tariffs",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Trump's broad-based tariffs are still having only a modest effect on prices. The cost of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month's 0.1%.",
      "Economists point to several reasons why Trump's tariffs have yet to accelerate the pace of inflation, as many analysts had expected. Like American consumers, companies imported billions of dollars of goods in the spring before the duties kicked in, and many items currently on store shelves were imported without paying higher levies.",
      "Some businesses are also absorbing higher import costs, cushioning consumers from price hikes.",
      "\"For the moment, there is nothing of consequence to worry about on the inflation side of this report,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told clients in a research note. \"There is, however, an unexpected drop in consumer spending, the first since the pandemic. That is something to think about. The Fed will make note of this report.\"",

      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to tie the knot in Italy this week, even as local frustrations mount over the multi-million dollar event.",
      "Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background.",
      "Where and when is the wedding?",
      "Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony expected to take place Friday, according to local media reports.",
      "The duo were sighted earlier this week as they arrived via taxi-boat at the Aman Hotel, a five-star hotel on the Grand Canal in Venice.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "Details on the wedding location of have remained under wraps, but Italian papers and Venetian locals predict it will take place Friday on San Giorgio Maggiore. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s.",
      "The reception is expected to be held on Saturday at Arsenale, a sprawling brick complex and former shipyard that was used from the 12th century until World War I. It's best known today as one of the main venues for the Biennale cultural festivals, which include exhibitions on art, architecture, film, dance, music and theater.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "The event has put a spotlight on the uber-weathly, with local protestors pushing back against the event's extravagance.",
      "\"Venice is not just a pretty picture, a pretty postcard to please the needs and wants of the elite or of mass tourists, but it is an alive city, made of people who want to actually live there,\" Stella Faye, a university researcher from Venice,\u00a0told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "According to a new Oxfam report, the world's richest 1% have increased their wealth by more than $33.9 trillion since 2015. The report also found that a group of 3,000 billionaires, which includes Bezos, have increased their wealth by $6.5 trillion in real terms since 2015. That's equivalent to 14.6% of global GDP.",
      "Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion).",
      "Who is attending?",
      "Bezos and Sanchez invited some 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports.",
      "The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests including Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brady, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Mick Jagger, Katy Perry, the Kardashian sisters, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, The Associated Press reported.",
      "According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport.",
      "Who is Lauren Sanchez?",
      "Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023.",
      "Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight, which included \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the\u00a0idea for a female-led flight to Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021.",
      "Sanchez's bachelorette party in Paris last month included Perry, Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Eva Longoria, according to AFP.",
      "What are the wedding protests about?",
      "Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs.",
      "This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protesters gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",
      "Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: \"IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\" Local police folded up the banner and took it away.",
      "Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated.",
      "\"We will always respect the right to speak out, but we reject every form of intolerance and prejudice,\" Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said in Thursday's edition of Italian newspaper Il Foglio Quotidiano. \"No one in Venice can claim the right of deciding who can enter, who can love, who can celebrate.\"",
      "In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding.",
      "Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista. But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Federal Communications Commission's multi-billion-dollar mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities.",
      "The high court ruled that neither Congress nor the FCC violated the Constitution with its chosen scheme for administering the Universal Service Fund, which is supported by contributions from communications carriers and funds programs designed to improve access to telecommunications services.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in dissent.",
      "\"For nearly three decades, the work of Congress and the Commission in establishing universal-service programs has led to a more fully connected country. And it has done so while leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "With its decision, the high court passed on an opportunity to revive a long-dormant legal concept known as the nondelegation doctrine, which some conservative justices have in recent years expressed support for revisiting.",
      "Rooted in the separation of powers, the doctrine restricts Congress from delegating its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. A conservative nonprofit called Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, arguing that Congress' delegation of power to the FCC and the FCC's delegation to a private corporation that sets carriers' contribution rates was unlawful.",
      "But the Supreme Court rejected the group's challenge and found that the Universal Service Fund does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.",
      "Established by the FCC after Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund aims to ensure communications systems are available nationwide. Carriers pay into the fund and the contributions are used to subsidize phone and internet services to low-income customers, rural and high-cost areas and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers.",
      "The FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company in 1997 to administer the fund and determine the amount carriers have to pay into it. The not-for-profit corporation also disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "Fees are set based on a percentage of a carriers' revenue, and telecommunications companies pass on their share to consumers. The program collects nearly $10 billion annually, according to the administrator.",
      "More than 12,000 schools and libraries, and more than 9,000 rural health care providers have benefited from initiatives backed by the Universal Service Fund, and more than 8 million low-oncome households have been served.",

      "The plaintiffs argued that the fund is unlawful because Congress unconstitutionally delegated its authority to the FCC, which in turn transferred power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with Consumers' Research and found that the combination of Congress' delegation to the FCC, and the commission's subdelegation to the fund administrator violates the Constitution.",

      "President Trump said at a White House event Thursday that Washington and Beijing had signed an agreement on trade, adding that he expects to have a deal with India soon. But Beijing and the White House later referred to the development as an agreement on the framework for a deal.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg TV the deal was signed earlier this week. Neither Lutnick nor Mr. Trump provided any details about the accord.",
      "\"We just signed with China the other day,\" the president said.",
      "Lutnick said the deal was \"signed and sealed\" two days earlier.",
      "Rare earth minerals apparently at center stage",
      "It was unclear if the latest accord was different from the one Mr. Trump announced two weeks earlier that he said would make it easier for American industries to obtain much-needed magnets and rare earth minerals. That pact cleared the way for the trade talks to continue, while the U.S. agreed to stop trying to revoke visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said Friday that the two sides had \"further confirmed the details of the framework.\" But its statement didn't explicitly mention U.S. access to rare earths, minerals essential for hi-tech products such as defense equipment, electric vehicles and hard drives. China dominates world production of those minerals.",
      "\"China will approve the export applications of controlled items that meet the conditions in accordance with the law. The United States will cancel a series of restrictive measures taken against China accordingly. It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway,\" the ministry said.",
      "The agreement follows initial talks in Geneva in early May that led both sides to postpone massive tariff hikes that were threatening to freeze much trade between the two countries. Later talks in London set a framework for negotiations and the deal mentioned by Mr. Trump appeared to formalize that agreement.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Thursday that the Trump administration and China had \"agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement.\"",
      "That clarification came after the Trump announcement of a \"deal\" at the White House event, at which he urged Republican lawmakers to approve the mammoth tax and budget bill before Congress.",
      "China hasn't announced any new agreements, but said earlier this week that it was speeding up approvals of exports of rare earths. Beijing's limits on rare earths exports have been a key point of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Beijing was accelerating review of export license applications for rare earths and had approved \"a certain number of compliant applications.\"",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington after China imposed permit requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Fentanyl another key in the trade talks",
      "China also has taken steps recently on the fentanyl issue, announcing last week that it would designate two more substances as precursor chemicals for fentanyl, making them subject to production, transport and export regulations. Mr. Trump has demanded that Beijing do more to stop the flow of such precursor ingredients to Mexican drug cartels, which use them to make fentanyl for sale in the U.S. He imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese imports over the fentanyl issue, the biggest part of current 30% across-the-board taxes on Chinese goods.",
      "The agreement struck in May in Geneva called for both sides to scale back punitive tariff hikes imposed as Mr. Trump escalated his trade war and sharply raised import duties. Some higher tariffs, such as those imposed by Washington related to the trade in fentanyl and duties on aluminum and steel, remain in place.",

      "The rapidly shifting policies are taking a toll on both of the world's two largest economies.",
      "The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, partly because imports surged as companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before Mr. Trump could impose tariffs on them.",

      "Still, Wall Street is awaiting more news on Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a 90-day pause on his so-called reciprocal tariffs slated to end on July 9. And Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last week that tariffs are likely to drive up inflation later this year, slowing economic growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why experts say the market is rebounding.",
      "Easing concerns about tariffs",
      "Since April, the markets have whipsawed in response to the Trump administration's on-again, off-again tariff policies.",
      "While uncertainty around the impact of the levies remains, analysts say investor concern has faded as trade negotiations have entered a quieter phase after the Trump administration\u00a0struck a deal with China earlier this month.",
      "\"We've gone into a period where we haven't had a lot of disruptive noise coming either out of Washington or among our trading partners,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"I think that's helped to sort of cool anxieties, at least for the time being.\"",
      "The next benchmark will be July 9, when the president's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs comes to an end. If the U.S. slips back into a more intense trade situation, the markets could show more volatility, Kenwell said.",
      "So far, data suggests a resilient economy, although some Wall Street economists have warned the economy may soon face headwinds.",
      "A\u00a0report from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute released Thursday predicts that the brunt of the tariffs impact will hit in the third quarter. The analysis also warns the tariffs could leave the U.S. with \"historically high and potentially debilitating levies.\"",
      "Optimism about tech stocks",
      "Technology stocks, dominated by the so-called \"magnificent 7\" \u2014 consisting of Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and other tech giants\u2014 have been integral in driving the market rebound, analysts say.",
      "Tech has become the best performing sector so far in the second quarter, a period which spans April through June. Financial companies such as banks and insurance firms have also been performing well, he added. According to Kenwell, those two sectors alone represent over 40% of the S&P 500.",
      "Chip company Nvidia closed at a record high on Thursday, allowing the company to retake its crown as the world's most valuable company. The tech giant's stock has soared almost 62% since the market's 2025 bottom on April 8.",
      "AI-powered companies have gained momentum in recent weeks, with Micron Technology, which sells computer memory and data storage, beating earnings expectations for the latest quarter, Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli pointed out.",
      "Investors have gravitated towards tech stocks, Luschini said, given their high free cash flow and potential for strong earnings growth.",
      "\"I think investors are looking at them as sort of a bastion of safety,\" he said.",
      "Signs of a potential rate cut",
      "Investors have been buoyed by forecasts for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.",
      "At the Fed's June meeting, the central bank said it would\u00a0hold rates steady but pencilled in two cuts for the remainder of the year. A rate cut could come as soon as the next meeting, July 29-30, but it's more likely it will happen during the September meeting, experts say.",
      "\"I think investors are kind of looking through the next several months to a period in which we're likely to see more accommodative monetary policy,\" said Luschini.",

      "Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.",
      "Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. \"It's hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,\" she said.",
      "In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn't worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.",
      "Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor's note. \"There's too much abuse in the system,\" she said. She added that she doesn't worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.",
      "\"That's their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,\" she said.",
      "President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.",
      "Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid \"for people who rightly deserve\" coverage, \"not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.\"",
      "Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.",
      "Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.",
      "A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.",
      "According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill \u2014 about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.",
      "The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. \"That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,\" he said.",
      "Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.",
      "Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at the Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.",
      "\"We're making it easy\" for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.",
      "\"We're a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,\" Carlton said. \"We're asking folks to engage in their communities. That's a fundamentally good thing to do that's part of getting benefits.\"",
      "Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months \u2014 and potentially as frequently as every month.",
      "\"This is not a conversation America should be in,\" said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. \"Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you're kicked off.\"",
      "The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)",
      "But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.",
      "Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.",
      "The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.",
      "But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled \u2014 that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas \u2014 do not receive SSI, according to KFF.",
      "\"It's hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough\" to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. \"Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.\"",
      "He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.",
      "Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.",
      "In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.",
      "Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.",
      "Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a \"modification\" from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.",
      "Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.",
      "Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings \u2014 that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job \u2014 explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.",
      "\"Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,\" he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. \"People struggle with the documentation process.\"",
      "Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs.",
      "Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. \"It will be messy,\" he said.",
      "Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don't, though he surmises it's a small portion of the population. \"People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.\"",

      "The U.S. economy shrank faster than previously thought during the first three months of 2025, with growth contracting for the first time in three years.",
      "The country's gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 0.5% from January through March, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its third and final GDP report\u00a0for the period. The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",
      "\"What we're witnessing is an economy temporarily buffered from the tariff shock by smart logistics maneuvers, proactive pricing strategies and some foreign exporter concessions,\" Daco said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",
      "Second-quarter rebound?",
      "The category of real final sales to private domestic purchasers includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics called the decline in that figure \"troubling,\u2033 though he doesn't expect to make a significant change to his near-term economic forecast.",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to the authors for comment, but did not hear back from Bartz or Wallace Johnson. Graeber declined to comment.",
      "Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots.",
      "At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.",

The case was brought by a group of well-known authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman and writer Jacqueline Woodson, who alleged Meta was \"liable for massive copyright infringement\" when it used copies of their books to train Meta's generative AI system Llama.",

    "summary": "Older, wealthier Americans would see the biggest lifetime benefit from the Republican budget bill, while younger generations could see losses, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican\u00a0budget package\u00a0aims to make President Donald Trump's tax cuts permanent while offering a host of new financial breaks. Yet the \"big, beautiful bill,\" as the legislation is dubbed, could also effectively transfer wealth from younger generations to older Americans over their lifetimes, a recent study finds.",
      "Long-term, the primary beneficiaries of the GOP bill would be older, wealthier Americans, while younger, middle- to low-income people would see fewer benefits, according to the analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies the fiscal issues.",
      "The group's projection assesses the impact of proposed tax cuts under the bill, as well as reductions in federal programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, better known as food stamps. Penn Wharton also factors in the long-term fiscal impact of the debt the U.S. would likely have to issue to pay for the bill's tax cuts, the group said.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay\"",
      "Younger Americans would bear the brunt of the nation's spiraling debt, Kent Smetters, director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay \u2014 nothing is for free. In this case, that's the future generations,\" he said. \"We have finally reached this inflection point where under any reasonable estimation, younger people are going to be worse off in the future\" if the current version of the bill is passed.",
      "For example, the bill would cost an infant born into a low-income family $14,100 over their lifetime. This loss stems from factors including reduced social safety net benefits and lower wages resulting from slower economic growth driven by increased national debt and deficits.",
      "On the other hand, a high-income 70-year-old stands to gain $120,000 over his remaining years due to the proposed legislation's tax cuts and other benefits, the analysis found.",
      "The House narrowly passed the legislation in May. Senate lawmakers are pressing to vote on the measure by the end of the week.",
      "The White House took issue with Penn Wharton's analysis.",
      "\"So-called 'experts' panning the One, Big, Beautiful Bill without a smidge of humility should remember that they made these same exact gloomy predictions about President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2013 tax cuts that helped usher in historic job, wage, investment and economic growth along with the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Biggest winners",
      "Like Penn Wharton, other researchers have said the Republican bill is likely to benefit wealthy Americans at the expense of people lower down the ladder.",
      "The measure would likely reduce the financial resources available to the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to a report published earlier this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. White House officials have previously questioned the CBO's scoring of the bill.",
      "But the highest-earning 10% of households would see a gain of $12,000 per year in resources, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000, the CBO projected. Its analysis is based on the bill's tax breaks, as well as reductions for federal programs and reductions in state funds for safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "In considering the impact of higher U.S. debt on future generations, the cost would come in the form of lower wages and higher costs, such as more expensive mortgages, Smetters said.",
      "Already, the U.S. is spending more than $1 trillion a year to service its debt \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. That's more than the nation currently spends on defense,\u00a0data\u00a0from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Clock ticking",
      "Taking on more debt to pay for the GOP bill could make it tougher for the federal government to pay for programs like Social Security as more of its budget is eaten up by interest payments. Higher debt would also likely result in higher interest rates, as well as slowing economic growth, the Yale Budget Lab projects.",
      "Elements of the bill are still under debate on Capitol Hill, with congressional Republicans racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the package to President Trump for his signature. The last scheduled day in session for both the House and Senate before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving little time to reach a deal.",
      "Some Republicans are at loggerheads over certain provisions, such as the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, with House lawmakers pushing for a bigger deduction than in the Senate.",
      "If the bill moves ahead, the long-term combination of benefit reductions and swelling federal debt could outweigh the benefits of tax cuts for younger Americans, the Penn Wharton analysis said.",
      "\"Sometimes people say, 'If I'm in 40th-60th [percentile of income], I won't get SNAP or Medicaid,' but actually there is a chance that you could still,\" Smetters said. \"There is a chance anybody could be unemployed or be on food stamps.\"",

      "It's the latest big food company making that pledge. Last week, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027. General Mills also said it plans to remove artificial dyes from its U.S. cereals and from all foods served in K-12 schools by the middle of 2026.",
      "The move has broad support. About two-thirds of Americans favor restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove ingredients like added sugar or dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll. Both California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.",
      "On Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill requiring foods made with artificial dyes or additives to contain a new safety label starting in 2027. The label would say they contain ingredients \"not recommended for human consumption\" in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the U.K.",
      "The federal government is also stepping up its scrutiny of artificial colors. In January, days before President Trump took office, U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation's food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of its potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Nestle has pledged to remove artificial dyes before. Early in 2015, the company said it would remove artificial flavors and colors from its products by the end of that year. But the promise didn't hold.",

      "The settlement was first\u00a0announced in December 2022. At the time, it marked the FTC's largest ever refund in a gaming industry case. The agency said at the time that Epic deceived consumers into making in-game purchases they would otherwise not have made.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is debating President Trump's massive tax bill Sunday ahead of Monday's session when the chamber will effort to pass the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second term agenda.",
      "The House narrowly passed the bill last month, and Senate Republicans have since been working to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber. The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are moving quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed.",
      "The Senate has been working through the weekend as the GOP nears a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the deadline. Known as \"One Big, Beautiful Bill,\" the legislation includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Sunday that the legislation would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "Senate Republicans voted to advance the legislation late Saturday, with all but two Republicans voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts. The vote on the motion to proceed stayed open for more than three hours as holdouts sought assurances from GOP leaders and even some tweaks were made to the bill before Republicans ultimately received enough votes to move forward.",
      "Senate Democrats further delayed the legislation's path forward by forcing the bill to be read in its entirety, starting late Saturday. After nearly 16 hours, the Senate clerks concluded their reading of the bill on the floor, starting the clock on debate. Each side now has 10 hours for debate, of which Democrats are expected to use all of their time to rail against the legislation.",
      "Senate Republicans have been pursuing the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. With only a simple majority required to advance the legislation, rather than the 60-votes needed to move forward with most legislation, Senate Democrats have few mechanisms to combat the bill's progress.",
      "Following debate, the Senate is set to begin a \"vote-a-rama,\" in which senators could offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. That process was originally expected to begin in the early morning hours on Monday, but Senate leadership said late Sunday that once debate concludes, the Senate would not reconvene until 9 a.m. ET Monday. Democrats are expected to use the opportunity to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose support from three Republicans \u2014 which would still require a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. And although a number of senators who had expressed opposition to the measure ultimately decided to advance it Saturday, how they will vote on the measure in a final vote remains unclear.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Saturday that \"it's time to get this legislation across the finish line,\" adding that \"53 members will never agree on every detail of legislation.\" But he urged that Republicans are \"united in our commitment to what we're doing in this bill.\"",
      "Vance was on hand to break a possible tie vote Saturday, though his vote ultimately wasn't needed. Still, the vice president met with GOP holdouts in the majority leader's office Saturday as the White House has put pressure on lawmakers to get the bill across the finish line.",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, warned Sunday that the legislation would be a \"political albatross\" for Republicans, while suggesting that the bill could even lose support among the GOP, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\"",
      "\"I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their conviction,\" Warner said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced Sunday that he won't seek reelection in 2026, hours after President Trump threatened to back a primary challenge against him when he refused to support his massive spending and tax bill which he dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"It's not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking re-election,\" Tillis said in a statement Sunday. He noted that he hasn't \"been excited about running for another term,\" citing the choice between \"spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington\" or spending time with his family.",
      "The North Carolina Republican was first elected to the Senate in 2014, and speculation has swirled for weeks around whether he would seek another term. The announcement came hours after Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social criticizing Tillis for his opposition to some of the provisions within the massive tax legislation making its way through the Senate, while the president said he would be meeting with possible primary opponents to run against Tillis, \"looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina.\"",
      "Tillis had said earlier Sunday that he could not support the legislation, which is the centerpiece of the president's second-term agenda, due to Medicaid cuts \"that would be devastating to North Carolina.\"",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor Sunday night, Tillis said, \"Republicans are about to make a mistake on health care and betraying a promise. It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made in the Oval Office or in the Cabinet Room when I was there with Finance, where he said we can go after waste, fraud and abuse on any programs.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters after his comments, he also took issue with the way the bill is being moved forward, saying, \"If you've got to surprise or jam your conference to get something done, you're a pretty sh***y legislator.\"",
      "The senator also outlined his thoughts about Washington in recent years in his earlier statement Sunday: \"It's become increasingly evident that leaders who are willing to embrace bipartisanship, compromise, and demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an endangered species.\"",
      "In an apparent nod to former Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Tillis said \"Democrats recently lost two such leaders who were dedicated to making the Senate more of a functional and productive legislative body.\" He added that \"their presence in the Senate chamber has been sorely missed every day since\" they opted not to seek reelection.",
      "\"It underscores the greatest form of hypocrisy in American politics,\" Tillis continued. \"When people see independent thinking on the other side, they cheer. But when those very same people see independent thinking coming from their side, they scorn, ostracize, and even censure them.\"",
      "The announcement will open up a key seat in North Carolina, which has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race, with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008.",
      "National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"has won North Carolina three times, and the state's been represented by two Republican Senators for over a decade.\"",
      "\"That streak will continue in 2026 when North Carolinians elect a conservative leader committed to advancing an agenda of opportunity, prosperity, and security,\" Scott said.",

      "Iran's nuclear capabilities suffered \"severe damage\" in last week's U.S. airstrikes but not \"total damage,\" said the man in charge of the world's global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. \"One cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.\"",
      "\"It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all,\" IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again.\"",
      "The U.S. launched three strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 21, following more than a week of Israeli attacks, which President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "But Grossi's comments appeared to support an early assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which suggested the strikes had only set back Iran's nuclear program by months. The Trump administration has slammed the DIA's assessment as \"low confidence,\" and Hegseth and other officials on Thursday went after the media for reporting on a \"leaked\" report.",
      "At a briefing Thursday, reporters questioned Hegseth repeatedly on whether Iran had moved its stocks of enriched uranium before the Israeli and U.S. strikes began. The defense secretary responded that he was \"not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be \u2014 moved or otherwise.\"",
      "Grossi on Sunday said Iran did not share that they had any plans to move the enriched uranium, but at the same time \"there was no physical time\" for Iran to share that information.",
      "The IAEA director general also conceded that it's \"logical to presume that when [Iran] announce[s] that they are going to be taking protective measures\" that moving the enriched uranium \"could be part of it.\" But he also emphasized that \"this is why it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brennan pushed Grossi that since it's unclear if the uranium had been moved and all the centrifuges cannot be accounted for, there's an open question that Iran could still \"sprint towards a bomb\u2026if they wanted to.\" Grossi said he didn't want to be an \"alarmist,\" but \"we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened.\"",
      "\"Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there,\" Grossi said. \"The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily.\"",
      "Grossi confirmed that his IAEA inspectors were never able to verify Iran's claims that its nuclear program was only for peaceful ends and that it was not trying to develop a weapon.",
      "\"We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending,\" Grossi said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that there were calls in Iran for the arrest and execution of Grossi.",
      "When asked about alleged threats against nuclear inspectors, Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation\" that Iran is not threatening nuclear inspectors, including Grossi.",
      "Nuclear inspectors \"are in Iran,\" Iravani said. He said they are in a \"safe condition,\" but \"they cannot have access to our site.\"",
      "Iravani also said that since Iran is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nuclear \"enrichment is our right, and an inalienable right, and we want to implement this right.\"",

      "According to FBI data and Justice Department officials who spoke with CBS News, the Tree of Life tragedy didn't slow the targeting of religious institutions, but was an early warning of the recent wave of planned attacks.",
      "FBI crime reports reviewed by CBS News show assaults or attacks against people at churches, synagogues, temples and mosques surged nearly 100% between 2021 and 2023.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon referenced a growing stack on her desk of criminal cases that allege the targeting of religious centers.",
      "\"I think it's a form of terrorism, because attacks on churches are meant to terrorize people,\" Dhillon said. \"And they're meant to deter people from going there. And so it makes everyone feel unsafe.\"",
      "On June 18, Justice Department prosecutors secured a 25-year prison term in the case of Rui Zhang of Virginia. Zhang was convicted of targeting a Haymarket, Virginia, church for an attack. Prosecutors alleged Zhang had written a manifesto, and that he was inside a Sunday service at the church with a semiautomatic handgun, two magazines of ammunition, and two knives. He allegedly had additional ammunition, knives, and a canister of bear spray in his nearby car.",
      "In April, the Justice Department also secured a conviction of an Arizona man of targeting a series of churches. According to investigators, Zimnako Saleh \"traveled to four Christian churches in Arizona, California, and Colorado, wearing black backpacks. At two of those churches, Salah planted those backpacks, placing congregants in fear that they contained bombs.",
      "At the other two churches, Salah was confronted by security before he got the chance to plant those backpacks. Photos of backpacks and movements from the day of the attempted attack inside the churches were included in charging documents.",
      "Dhillon said civil rights investigators have marshalled a more focused effort to combat the targeting of houses of worship.",
      "\"We want to shut that threat down by making sure that no one is feeling like churches, houses of worship, people of faith are soft targets in the United States,\" Dhillon said. \"That is why it's a priority.\"",
      "The increasing wave of threats against religious centers is \u2013 at least partly \u2013 driven by emerging white nationalism or the targeting of minority groups or churches that are welcoming to LGBTQ communities, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a liberal-leaning nonprofit organization which focuses on civil rights issues and combating hate crimes.",
      "\"About one in 10 of the attacks that we documented in the first six months of 2024 were also focused on 'welcoming' religious communities,\" said R.G. Cravens, an SPLC researcher.",
      "\"We have seen an uptick in synagogues being targeted for similar things like vandalism, graffiti and harassment\u00a0 since the October 7th (attacks) in Israel,\" Cravens added. \"And those come in a lot of forms that often do indicate the hard right white nationalist and white supremacist groups are involved.\"",
      "Dhillon directed CBS News to several other recent cases under investigation by the Justice Department. In February, Kevin Colantonio, 36, of Rhode Island pleaded guilty to a federal criminal charge for setting multiple fires around the exterior of a predominantly black church in North Providence.",
      "The federal criminal cases yield the possibility of lengthy prison terms. Zhang's prison term runs through the year 2050.",
      "Dhillon said the Justice Department's new leadership has an urgency in tackling these cases, pointing to hate crime charges filed against a man who allegedly used Molotov cocktails to attack peaceful marchers in Boulder, Colorado, on June 1.",
      "\"We were all over it. And we filed what has been described to me as the fastest hate crime criminal complaint in recent history,\" Dhillon said. \"It is important for the community being targeted to feel and see that the United States is taking these crimes with the utmost seriousness.\"",
      "The Justice Department is preparing for an August court hearing in the case of Elias Rodriguez, who is accused of targeting and murdering two Israeli embassy officials in Washington, D.C. last month.",
      "Rodriguez allegedly shot and killed the victims \u2014 a couple about to become engaged, according to Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the U.S. \u2014 as they were leaving the museum, which is located in the heart of the U.S. capital. According to police and video from the scene, he shouted \"free, free Palestine\" as he was being taken into custody.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Justice Department announced that the case was being investigated as a potential hate crime.\u00a0 Rodriguez is being held in pretrial detention.",

      "\"This is the most outrageous action, I think, this crowd has taken on education,\" Warner told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"We have great public universities in Virginia. We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the Governor. Jim Ryan had done a very good job; just completed a major capital campaign.\"",

      "When asked if the threat was explicit, Warner said, \"It was that explicit.\"",
      "Warner described the pressure as personal rather than policy-driven.",
      "\"You're shocked it's coming- personal attacks are coming out of this administration?\" he asked. \"This federal D.O.E. and Department of Justice should get their nose out of University of Virginia. They are doing damage to our flagship university. And if they can do it here, they'll do it elsewhere.\"",
      "In his resignation letter, Ryan warned of the potential risks of resisting the administration's demands.\u00a0 \"Hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld,\" Ryan wrote.",
      "His resignation came amid an investigation that targeted DEI efforts across multiple universities, with UVA's president coming under intense scrutiny from the Department of Education and Department of Justice, according to CBS News reporting.",
      "Warner acknowledged the difficult choice Ryan faced.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I understand that, with so many things at stake, that the idea, and I think Jim Ryan laid it out, that he was going to make his personal job more important than these cuts. But, boy, that shouldn't have been the choice.\"",
      "Warner also warned that other public universities could face similar scrutiny.",
      "The DOJ is also probing the University of California system's hiring practices, investigating whether efforts to boost faculty diversity violate federal anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\"They want to take on public universities the way they have now taken on the Ivies,\" Warner said. \"This is going to hurt our universities. Chase away world-class talent. And frankly, if we don't have some level of academic freedom, then what kind of country are we?\"",
      "Most prominent among the Ivy League schools targeted by the Trump administration has been Harvard University.\u00a0 In June, the Trump administration moved to block new international students from enrolling at Harvard, accusing the university of failing to report disciplinary records and calling it \"no longer a trustworthy steward\" of international programs. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order and later extended it, describing the administration's actions as\u00a0 unconstitutional retaliation.",
      "The administration also revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, froze research funding, and pressed the university on DEI policies and campus protests. Harvard has sued, calling the actions politically motivated and a threat to academic freedom.",

A moment when each of us can recommit to engaging in politics and life the way Mark and Melissa did \u2013 fiercely, enthusiastically, heartily, but without ever losing sight of our common humanity,\" Walz said. \"But let's not do it because of the way Mark and Melissa died. Let's do it because of the way they lived, and the way they led. With joy and passion. With respect and empathy. With purpose and humility.\"",

      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Because it takes 16 million Americans off of health care coverage with cuts to Medicaid and cuts to the Obamacare marketplace.",
      "That will move us as a nation back to the same percentage of uninsured we had before Obamacare. And it's not like these people are not going to get sick. They're going to show up at the emergency room. Rural hospitals are going to shut down. That has been evidenced across the nation.",
      "It also goes after food assistance. Do we \u2013 are we really in such a place that we're cutting, in my state, a couple hundred thousand people off of school lunches, school breakfasts? They even cut food banks. It's cruel. They have also ended up, at the end of the day, cutting 20,000-plus clean energy jobs.",
      "And for what? This was to make sure that the highest, most wealthy Americans can get an extra tax break. And, as you just saw on your Chyron there, it adds $4.5 trillion to the debt. I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this. And we will see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their convictions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of the Republicans are arguing, well, we have to deal with these entitlements, and the work requirements and things that may lead to some of the lack of qualifications you talk about, they're not that burdensome. It's volunteer work or part-time work. So are you overstating it?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No, it's 16 million Americans off of health care.",
      "Medicaid cuts, they're \u2013 these numbers, they're not my numbers. They're all independent sources. And what \u2013 the thing that I don't think people have realized, people say, well, I'm Medicaid, I'm not poor, I maybe buying my health insurance through the marketplace. Your rates will go up $800 or $900 a month.",
      "And that will trickle through the whole rest of the health care market, because, if you suddenly take people out of the system, they show up at the emergency room in uncompensated care, the only way those costs get passed on is higher health insurance to all of us who have traditional coverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if this is so against their own interests, why haven't you been able to peel more Republicans away?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I think we will see. Even as recently as just an hour ago, some of the special Medicaid provisions for certain states, I think, were disallowed because of the so-called Byrd rule.",
      "And it's not over until it's over. I will give you \u2013 I will grant that President Trump has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner. At the other end, this bill will come back and bite them. This is going to do so much damage in terms of not only health care, food assistance, the whole notion that we are moving towards cleaner and energy jobs, all on the chopping block, adding $4 trillion into the debt.",

      "And let's just be clear. You can actually set back the major program where they were trying to create potentially \u2013 and there had been no decision made by the ayatollah to actually move towards weaponization, but where they could have a weaponized system with a dozen-plus missiles that are nuclear \u2013 nuclear-armed.",
      "But what they don't know is, they didn't \u2013 and this was appropriate. I don't \u2013 I'm not criticizing administration. They didn't go after the enriched uranium that was Isfahan, at that base, because it's buried so deeply. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They just hit it with Tomahawks, not the bunker-busters.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: So, the fact that they can have still enriched uranium, they may have some ability to still cascade that means they could still move forward on something that might be not delivered by a missile, but a bomb in a trunk of a car.",

      "But coming back to what you just said, there had been no decision by the supreme leader to make a weapon. Secretary of State Rubio on this program last Sunday told me it was irrelevant, the answer to that question, because Iran had everything it needed to make and build a weapon.",
      "So, based on what you know, was there an emergency? Was there a reason the U.S. had to act in the moment it did?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: We were on the verge of what could have been a much greater war in terms of Iran and Israel spreading to the whole region.",
      "Was there the imminent emergency that would trigger \u2013 because lots of presidents have looked at taking this action. I think that's very debatable. If, at the end of the day, we end up where this peace holds and Iran doesn't strike back, hallelujah.",
      "But what we don't know, for example, is Iran going to try to hit us on cyber, with this administration cutting literally half of our cybersecurity personnel in this country? So do \u2013 I just want to make sure that we do this in a measured way. The military did great. We have set them back.",

      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And the only way we can get resolution on that Margaret \u2013 and Secretary Rubio acknowledged this in the brief \u2013 is if we have boots on the ground with inspectors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: That means we have got to go to diplomacy.",

      "I think these numbers, it's all about waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid. What I'm voting for is a border security measure, $80 billion, $12 billion to reimburse states like mine. I'm voting for $150 billion that will go to our Department of Defense at a time when we saw, with Iran, it is desperately needed.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Not to get into the weeds on the economics, but the dynamic scoring is not taken into account here by the Congressional Budget Office.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, first of all, I respect the IAEA. Their job is to inspect, not to be an intelligence agency, so they don't really have the clear intelligence analysis that I would attribute to our intelligence community like the CIA.",

Russia didn't come to their \u2013 to their aid. China basically ran back for cover. Iran is on its own and psychologically is very damaged. The deterrence is real. The damage is real.",

We have to take it seriously that there could be sleeper cells in the United States that could go after people like Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, you know \u2013 you know, myself and others that were involved in that decision-making, and including the president of the United States. We know he's been targeted.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look now at some of the changes to America's public health policies under the Trump administration, we're joined by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on the board at Pfizer and is now the chairman of the board at Illumina.",
      "Good morning. Good to see you.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Dr. Gottlieb, you worked in the first Trump administration. This second Trump administration seems very different in its approach to public health on a lot of fronts. One of them was really laid bare this week with this newly remade Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.",
      "Secretary Kennedy had dismissed about 17 members of the existing board and put in some members of his own choice. And, in a video, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said federal immunization policy is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"no longer a credible process\" and it's being politicized at the expense of children.",
      "That's a pretty stunning statement. Do you agree with the Academy of Pediatrics?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, you're right. I worked in the first Trump administration. I was fortunate to do that and proud to serve in that administration. I think we did a lot of important things on public health. We presided over the first cell and gene therapy approvals.",
      "The president tried to expand access to those treatments through the right to try legislation that he championed. He supported the FDA on an effort to try to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids, record number of generic approvals, and a lot of other accomplishments.",
      "I think a lot of people on my side of the political aisle feel that a lot of these policies that Secretary Kennedy is championing are \u2013 are going to be contained to vaccines and not bleed into a broader public health doctrine.",
      "I think that's not right. I think there's a lot of people now who don't think these things are particularly political, or shouldn't be, and don't think these decisions should be politically decided who are going to find, when they go to the doctor's office, that vaccines that they may want to protect their lives or the lives of their families aren't going to be available.",
      "This does look like a political process right now. The secretary is going after issues that have long been bugaboos of him and his anti-vax group, Children's Health Defense. I don't think that's unmistakable \u2013 mistakable at this point. And I think that he would probably acknowledge that, that he's taking on issues that he's championed for the last 20 years to restrict access to certain vaccines.",
      "That's going to grow. The list is growing, and it's going to start to be very tangible for people, and go well beyond just the COVID vaccine, which is, I think, what most people think about when they perceive this administration's or the secretary's efforts to try to restrict access to vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the specific things from this meeting was advice to avoid flu vaccines containing an ingredient called thimerosal.",
      "Right around the same time as the meeting, the CDC removed information from its website that debunked claims that this ingredient was linked to autism. Secretary Kennedy says it's \u2013 it's journalists who are obscuring the truth.",
      "What do people need to know about the flu vaccine and this ingredient?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, so this is an old ingredient. It's a preservative used in multidose vials of flu vaccine primarily. Only a very small percentage of flu vaccine vials still contain it.",
      "What it is, is an ingredient that's added to multidose vials, because those vials, you're going to go in and out of with different needles as you administer the vaccine to different patients. So they're not single dose injections. They're multidose vials that \u2013 primarily used in some busy clinics, almost exclusively in adults right now.",
      "Back in the early 2000s, I was at FDA when we reformulated the vaccine, so we compelled manufacturers to reformulate the vaccines to take this preservative out, not because we thought it was unsafe, but because there was a lot of consternation among anti-vax groups that they thought that there was a link between this ingredient and autism.",
      "The ingredient does contain small amounts of ethylmercury, not methylmercury, ethylmercury, which is the same kind of mercury found in fish, in very small \u2013 very small amounts. And so we compelled the manufacturers to reformulate the vast majority of vaccines. Still, 4 percent of flu vaccines that get administered, mostly to adults, are from these multidose vials.",
      "And this has long been a bugaboo of the secretary and his group, the Children's Health Defense Fund. In fact, the only presentation at the ACIP meeting was from the head of that group. And you're right that there was a countering analysis from the CDC officials asserting that there's no link between thimerosal and autism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That \u2013 that analysis was taken down from the website. The secretary put out a statement that said that it wasn't \u2013 it didn't go through proper review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, Dr. Gottlieb, and talk more with you on the other side of this. These are complicated issues I want to dig into with you.",
      "So we hope all of you will stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb.",
      "Dr. Gottlieb, just to pick back up, we were talking about the meeting that took place this past week with the newly reconstituted advisory committee on immunization. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, you know him, he's a doctor, he has oversight and chairs the Health Committee, he called for the meeting to be canceled because he said there's no CDC director in place, and when it comes to these appointees, he said, \"many of them do not have significant experience studying microbiology, epidemiology, or immunology.\" And they may have preconceived bias against mRNA vaccines.",
      "It's \u2013 I'm not a doctor, but it seems to me that experience in immunology would be important if you're advising on immunizations. His counsel was ignored here. Is there any check on Secretary Kennedy at this point? Is there a need to get a CDC director in place quickly?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D., (Former FBA Commissioner): Yes, well, the CDC director had a confirmation hearing this week, and hopefully she'll be in place soon. I think he's quite strong and a good pick for that job.",
      "The board, this ACIP board, isn't fully constituted. There's only seven members on the board. At its peak membership it has about 15. And you're right, a lot of the people who have been appointed don't have deep experience or any experience, quite frankly, in vaccine science. They are people who have been ideologically aligned with Secretary Kennedy in the past and worked with him, many of them, not all of them. And I think that that isn't something that even the secretary would probably dispute at this time.",
      "And it did lead to some awkward moments at that meeting. For example, you know, one member had to have explained to him the difference between an antibody prophylaxis and a vaccine. So, there were evidence in that discussion where the CDC directors had to provide some, quite frankly, remedial assistance to help brief these members on the basis of vaccine science. So, it did show.",
      "Hopefully, once they fully constitute that board, you're going to get more balance on it. I think some people are skeptical. I remain hopeful that there will be some good members that get seated eventually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, one of the things about the American health system is that question of continued innovation. Earlier this month, the FDA approved a twice-yearly injection of an HIV prevention drug called Lenacapavir. How significant is an innovation like that. And given the environment you're talking about, will these new advisers get in the way of being able to get those kind of things to market?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, this shouldn't come before ACIP. So, this is a therapeutic. It's a long-acting antiviral that provides six months of protection against HIV and was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection in a population that was high risk of contracting HIV. So, it was a change in the formulation of an antiviral that allows it to be administered just twice a year and provides sustained exposure to the benefits of that antiviral.",
      "We're seeing a lot of innovation like this. There was also news this week from a small biotech company that I don't have any involvement with that they had developed a pill that could provide sustained protection against flu. So, it's an antiviral, but it is formulated in a way where it could be administered once ahead of flu season to provide protection across the entire season, and also look to be very effective. So, we're seeing a lot of innovations like this.",
      "What I'm worried about is innovation in vaccine science. I work on the venture capital side, where we make investments in \u2013 in new companies. And there has been a pullback of biotech start-ups that have been looking to develop new vaccines. For example, vaccines for Epstein-Barr virus, which we know is linked to certain \"b\"-cell lymphomas and maybe is linked to multiple sclerosis. That \u2013 that's a new area of science, the potential to vaccinate children against that, much like we vaccinate kids against HPV right now and prevent cervical cancer and other types of cancers. Maybe in the future we may be vaccinating for EBV. But there's been a lot of pullback to that kind of investment. And so I think we're going to see less innovation in vaccine science as a result of the environment we're in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Secretary Kennedy was asked this week about the declarations in some states to start removing fluoride from water. Oklahoma made some moves in that direction. He said, \"You're going to see probably slightly more cavities, but there's a direct inverse correlation between the amount of fluoride in your water and your loss of IQ.\" What should parents be thinking about when they hear things like that?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this has been a long-standing issue. Another issue that Secretary Kennedy has championed over his career, this perceived \u2013 this perception that there's a link between fluoride in water and some neurotoxic effects of that. That's been studied thoroughly. It's been, I think, fully debunked. There's very small amounts of fluoride in water. And at the levels that it's put into the water supply, it's been demonstrated to be safe.",
      "The CDC has data showing that there's a 25 percent reduction in dental caries (ph) as a result of fluoride that's added routinely to the water supply. It's not just a question of increased dental cavities, but also oral health more generally, which we know is correlated to systemic health.",

Friday, we spoke with the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, and we asked him just that.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI (IAEA Director General): It's clear that what happened in particular in \u2013 in Fordow, in Natanz, Isfahan, where Iran used to have and still has to some degree capabilities in terms of treatment, conversion, and enrichment of uranium have been destroyed to an important degree. Some is still standing. So, there is, of course, an important setback in terms of those \u2013 of those capabilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was roughly 400 kilograms, which is just under 900 pounds, of highly enriched uranium before the attacks.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know these are in small canisters and relatively easy to move. Do you have any idea where that was moved and if it was moved before the attack?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: We presume, and I think it's \u2013 it's logical to presume, that when they announced that they are going to be taking protective measures, this could be part of it. But as I said, we don't know where this material could be, or if part of it could have been, you know, under the attack during those 12 days. So, some could have been destroyed as part of the attack, but some could have been moved.",
      "So, there has to be, at some point, a clarification. If we don't get that clarification, this will continue to be hanging, you know, over our heads as \u2013 as a potential problem. So, this is why I say, it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If we don't know where the highly enriched uranium is, and cannot account for all the centrifuges, is there still a risk that they could rushing towards a bomb?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: We don't want to be alarmists here. And I don't want to \u2013 to \u2013 to be part of a, you know, a messaging that would be spreading, as I say, alarm. But we need to be in a position to assert and to confirm what is there and \u2013 and where is it and \u2013 and \u2013 and what happened.",
      "Iran had a very vast, ambitious program. Part of it may still be there. And if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So, you cannot dis-invent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So, I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations are not \u2013 you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily.",

But our inspection work was \u2013 was constant. In particular, in this sensitive area of the number of centrifuges and the amount of material, we had perfect view. We didn't have view on other things that we wanted to have. But on this one, it was \u2013 it was complete. It was comprehensive. And \u2013 and, of course, at the moment, there is \u2013 there is nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran wasn't keeping its stockpile of enriched uranium secret. What do you think it was intended for? And did you see anything that suggested that they were looking to weaponize?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: They have all of these capabilities, but for the agency they \u2013 first of all, they didn't have nuclear weapons, OK? This needs to be said. The IAEA does not judge intentions. The IAEA looks at the activities of a country and reports it to the world. So, it is countries that \u2013 that say, well, this is of concern on a (ph).",
      "What we were concerning \u2013 what I was concerned about is that there were other things that were not clear. For example, we have found traces of uranium in \u2013 in \u2013 in some places in Iran which were not the normal, declared facilities. And we were asking for years, why did we find these traces of enriched uranium in place \"x,\" \"y,\" or zed (ph). And we were simply not getting credible answers.",

And there were many, I can assure you, there were many that they \u2013 that we're seeing (ph) in your report, you must say that they have nuclear weapons, or they are very close to have nuclear weapons.

They have to rebuild electrical and water supplies. The CIA and the national intelligence director say the facilities were destroyed, and it would take years to rebuild. Israel says the military program is set back many years.",

Or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there. It is clear that there have been severe damage, but is not total damage, first of all.",

It is a very clear law of our parliament that they have suspended our cooperation with IAEA because the agency has not implemented their rights, their responsibility. Due to this, it is conditional law. And as long as this condition has not been set, so are the cooperation with IAEA will be suspended.",

Are the IAEA personnel, are the inspectors already inside Iran safe and can they go back to their work of inspecting your sites?",

So, we are in the negotiation, we are ready for the negotiation. But after this aggression, it is not proper condition for a new round of the negotiation. And there is no request for negotiation and meeting with the president.",

And while the supreme leader issued a statement saying Iran had dealt the U.S. a slap in the face, after that, President Trump said he had actually stopped Israel from going further and had stopped Israel from an attempt to kill your supreme leader. Why not take the offer of a diplomatic lifeline? Because he seems to be offering one.",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: Oh, it is a very gross violation of international law that they're treating the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran or any heads of our state. They have impunity from any attacks. So, we should understand that what is the principle and condition for any negotiation. Negotiation is \u2013 has its \u2013 the principles, and it is a give and take process. So we should engage in the negotiation and discuss with this order (ph) maybe we reach to a conclusion or not.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look now at some of the changes to America's public health policies under the Trump administration, we're joined by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on the board at Pfizer and is now the Chairman of the Board at Illumina. Good morning. Good to see you.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Dr. Gottlieb, you worked in the first Trump administration. This second Trump administration seems very different in its approach to public health on a lot of fronts. One of them was really laid bare this week with this newly remade Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. Secretary Kennedy had dismissed about 17 members of the existing board and put in some members of his own choice. And in a video, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said federal immunization policy is, quote, 'no longer a credible process' and it's being politicized at the expense of children. That's a pretty stunning statement. Do you agree with the Academy of Pediatrics?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, you're right. I worked in the first Trump administration. I was fortunate to do that and proud to serve in that administration. I think we did a lot of important things on public health. We presided over the first cell and gene therapy approvals. The president tried to expand access to those treatments through the Right to Try legislation that he championed. He supported the FDA on an effort to try to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids, record number of generic approvals, and a lot of other accomplishments. I think a lot of people on my side of the political aisle feel that a lot of these policies that Secretary Kennedy is championing are- are going to be contained to vaccines and not bleed into a broader public health doctrine. I think that's not right. I think there's a lot of people now who don't think these things are particularly political, or shouldn't be, and don't think these decisions should be politically decided, who are going to find when they go to the doctor's office that vaccines that they may want to protect their lives or the lives of their families aren't going to be available. This does look like a political process right now. The secretary is going after issues that have long been bugaboos of him and his anti-vax group, Children's Health Defense. I don't think that's mistakable at this point. I think that he would probably acknowledge that. That he's taking on issues that he's championed for the last 20 years to restrict access to certain vaccines. That's going to grow. The list is growing, and it's going to start to be very tangible for people and go well beyond just the COVID vaccine, which is, I think, what most people think about when they perceive this administration's, or the secretary's efforts, to try to restrict access to vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the specific things from this meeting was advice to avoid flu vaccines containing an ingredient called thimerosal. Right around the same time as the meeting, the CDC removed information from its website that debunked claims that this ingredient was linked to autism. Secretary Kennedy says it's- it's journalists who are obscuring the truth. What do people need to know about the flu vaccine and this ingredient?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so this is an old ingredient. It's a preservative used in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine, primarily. Only a very small percentage of flu vaccine vials still contain it. What it is is an ingredient that's added to multi-dose vials because those vials you're going to go in and out of with different needles as you administer the vaccine to different patients. So they're not single dose injections. They're multi-dose vials that primarily used in some busy clinics, almost exclusively in adults right now. Back in the early 2000s, I was at FDA when we reformulated the vaccine, so we compelled manufacturers to reformulate the vaccines to take this preservative out. Not because we thought it was unsafe, but because there was a lot of consternation among anti-vax groups that they thought that there was a link between this ingredient and autism. The ingredient does contain small amounts of ethylmercury, not methylmercury, ethylmercury, which is the same kind of mercury found in fish, in very small- very small amounts. And so we compelled the manufacturers to reformulate the vast majority of vaccines, still four percent of flu vaccines that get administered, mostly to adults, are from these multi-dose vials. This has long been a bugaboo of the secretary and his group, the Children's Health Defense Fund. In fact, the only presentation at the ACIP meeting was from the head of that group. And you're right that there was a countering analysis from the CDC officials asserting that there's no link between thimerosal and autism. That- that analysis was taken down from the website. The secretary put out a statement that said that it wasn't- it didn't go through proper review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, Dr. Gottlieb, and talk more with you on the other side of this. These are complicated issues I want to dig into with you. So we hope all of you will stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Dr. Gottlieb, just to pick back up, we were talking about the meeting that took place this past week with the newly reconstituted Advisory Committee on Immunization. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, you know him, he's a doctor. He has oversight and chairs the Health Committee. He called for the meeting to be canceled because he said there's no CDC director in place. And when it comes to these appointees, he said many of them 'do not have significant experience studying microbiology, epidemiology or immunology' and they may have 'preconceived bias' against mRNA vaccines. It's- I'm not a doctor, but it seems to me that experience in immunology would be important if you're advising on immunizations. His counsel was ignored here. Is there any check on Secretary Kennedy, at this point? Is there a need to get a CDC director in place quickly?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, well, the CDC director had a confirmation hearing this week, and hopefully she'll be in place soon. I think she's quite strong and a good pick for that job. The board, this ACIP board, isn't fully constituted. There's only seven members on the board. At its peak membership, it has about 15. And you're right, a lot of the people who have been appointed don't have deep experience, or any experience, quite frankly, in vaccine science. They are people who have been ideologically aligned with Secretary Kennedy in the past and worked with him, many of them, not all of them. And I think that that isn't something that even the secretary would probably dispute at this time, and it did lead to some awkward moments at that meeting. For example, you know, one member had to have explained to him the difference between an antibody prophylaxis and a vaccine. So there were evidence in that discussion where the CDC directors had to provide some, quite frankly, remedial assistance to help brief these members on the basis of vaccine science. So it did show, hopefully, once they fully constitute that board, you're going to get more balance on it. I think some people are skeptical. I remain hopeful that there will be some good members that get seated eventually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, one of the things about the American health system is that question of continued innovation. Earlier this month, the FDA approved a twice yearly injection of an HIV prevention drug called lenacapavir. How significant is an innovation like that, and given the environment you're talking about, will these new advisors get in the way of being able to get those kind of things to market?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, this shouldn't come before ACIP. So this is a therapeutic. It's a long acting antiviral that provides six months of protection against HIV and was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection in a population that was high risk of contracting HIV. So it's a change in the formulation of an antiviral that allows it to be administered just twice a year and provide sustained exposure to the benefits of that antiviral. We're seeing a lot of innovation like this. There was also news this week from a small biotech company that I don't have any involvement with, that they had developed a pill that could provide sustained protection against flu. So it's an antiviral, but it is formulated in a way where it- it could be administered once ahead of flu season, to provide protection across the entire season, and also look to be very effective. So we're seeing a lot of innovations like this. What I'm worried about is innovation in vaccine science. I work on the venture capital side, where we make investments in- in new companies, and there has been a pullback of biotech startups that have been looking to develop new vaccines, for example, vaccines for Epstein-Barr Virus, which we know is linked to certain B-cell lymphomas, and maybe is linked to multiple sclerosis. That- that's a new area of science, the potential to vaccinate children against that, much like we vaccinate kids against HPV right now and prevent cervical cancer and other types of cancers. Maybe in the future, we may be vaccinating for EBV, but there's been a lot of pullback to that kind of investment. So I think we're going to see less innovation in vaccine science as a result of the environment we're in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Secretary Kennedy was asked this week about the declarations in some states to start removing fluoride from water. Oklahoma made some moves that direction. He said you're going to see 'probably slightly more cavities,' but 'there's a direct inverse correlation between the amount of fluoride in your water and your loss of IQ.' What should parents be thinking about when they hear things like that?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this has been a long standing issue, another issue that Secretary Kennedy has championed over his career, this perceived- perception that there's a link between fluoride and water and some neurotoxic effects of that. That's been studied thoroughly. It's been, I think, fully debunked. There's very small amounts of fluoride in water, and at the levels that it's put into the water supply, it's been demonstrated to be safe. CDC's- has data showing that there's a 25% reduction in dental caries as a result of fluoride that's added routinely to the water supply. It's not just a question of increased dental cavities, but also oral health more generally, which we know is correlated to systemic health.",

      "REP. MCCAUL: No, I'm going to vote for it for this reason. I think these numbers, it's all about waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid. What I'm voting for is a border security measure, $80 billion,\u00a0 $12 billion to reimburse states like mine. I'm voting for $150 billion that will go to our Department of Defense at a time when we saw with Iran, is desperately needed. The world is on fire, Eastern Europe, Indo-Pacific.

      "REP. MCCAUL: No-no. It's about- it's about- it's great for the country, and I've outlined the three top points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to help me understand then- you have such narrow margins in the house, and you look at these projections from like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, they say it violates the House instructions by $500 billion or more, what the Senate just put together here, and that deficits could rise more than $3 trillion. How do you get that through when you have fellow conservatives who are fiscal hawks and saying, I can't get with this, like Chip Roy?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Not to get into the weeds on the economics, but the dynamic scoring is not taken into account here by the Congressional Budget Office. That means that when you cut taxes, you actually get increased revenues to the Treasury. And that's something we saw under President Kennedy, under President Reagan, and under President Bush.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chip Roy and some of these other fiscal conservatives are going to come along for the ride?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, I think at the end of the day, I think they're going to vote for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do. Let's talk about some of the threats that you mentioned there, at home and abroad. You've been briefed on the actions against Iran. The IAEA director told us here that Iran has capabilities and could be up and running within a matter of months. Do you think it is an overstatement by the White House or a mistake to declare mission accomplished?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, first of all, I respect the IAEA. Their job is to inspect not to be an intelligence agency, so they don't really have the clear intelligence analysis that I would attribute to our intelligence community like the CIA. We met with Director Ratcliffe. It was not just his decision. These are career and intelligence officers that have been at the CIA for over 30 years that made this assessment that it was severely damaged and sets a program back a matter of years. In any event, the world and the Middle East is safer today than it was seven days ago, a week ago. That is highlighted by the fact that the proxies didn't light up. Russia didn't come to their- to their aid. China basically ran back for cover. Iran is on its own and psychologically, is very damaged. The deterrence is real. The damage is real. This is a masterful military operation, the likes of which I haven't seen since my father's war, World War Two.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the homeland front, do you then dismiss these concerns about threats? You have the National Terrorism Advisory System that says there's a heightened threat environment in the US. After the strikes, there were federal agents that arrested 11 foreign nationals from Iran, including one who had ties to Hezbollah. Have you seen specific evidence of any kind of threat here in the United States, or is it, as you say, just done and over with?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No, I have. We picked up 11 Iranians, one a sniper, one IRGC, another one, a known suspected terrorist, just within the last couple of days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were they planning to do anything, or did they just happen to have those alliances from the past?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: You know, I don't know all the details, but I will tell you the FBI briefed me in a defensive briefing after Soleimani was killed. I was a part of that--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: -- back in 2020--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that I was under indictment in Iran and that I was on that top target list. So, you know, look- is it imminent? I don't know. We have to take it seriously that there could be sleeper cells in the United States, that could go after people like Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, you know- you know- myself and others that were involved in that decision making and including the president of the United States. We know he's been targeted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to detention of migrants here in the United States, it's a high 59,000 detainees, according to ICE. 47% of them, though, lack a criminal record, fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes. Doesn't that show that the numbers- these aren't the worst of the worst.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Yeah, I was a federal prosecutor for many years. Counterterrorism. You have to prioritize, right? I would prioritize the aggravated felons that my Mayorkas let in, in defiance of federal law. It was shall detain. He said, may detain and let them out into the streets. I would, I would prioritize that first.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you would prefer that Homeland Security prioritize them and not run up the numbers the way they are in this--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: I think they're running the numbers up because 15 to 20 million people came under the- under the Biden administration, and they're trying to get some sanity involved in the United States. And I think deterrence is the key here. And Margaret, it is working. You know, the apprehension rate at the border, and Texas is the biggest one, has gone down to almost zero. I mean, the border is just about secure, catch and release is over, and the threats are going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike McCaul, Congressman, thank you very much for your insights today.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Thanks, Margaret, thanks for having me.",

    "summary": "Sen. Mark Warner suggested that the bill, which is nearing a final vote in the Senate, could lose support from Republicans, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said Sunday that President Trump's tax bill that's nearing a final vote in the Senate will be a \"political albatross\" for Republicans, citing the cuts to social safety nets and its projected effect on the national debt.",
      "\"I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their conviction,\" Warner said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Senate is working through the weekend as the GOP makes a push to pass the legislation, known as the \"big, beautiful bill,\" ahead of a July 4 deadline to get the bill to the president's desk. The House narrowly approved the bill last month, but the Senate has been putting its imprint on the massive package that extends Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts and would fund border security, defense and energy production priorities, costs which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the legislation  would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "In addition to the increase to the national debt, Warner criticized the bill for the toll he warned it would take on rural hospitals, access to health insurance, food assistance and clean energy jobs.",
      "The Senate is expected to begin a marathon overnight session Sunday as the bill nears final passage. It would then return to the House for signoff on the upper chamber's changes, before it can go to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "Senate Republicans are working to pass the legislation under the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. The process means Senate Democrats have few mechanisms to combat the bill, which they largely oppose, apart from delaying a vote. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer forced the bill to be read on the floor in its entirety late Saturday, which has pushed back debate on the bill by more than 12 hours.",
      "When asked why Democrats are expected to widely oppose the bill when there are provisions within it that they may see as favorable, such as an expansion of the Child Tax Credit and a provision limiting taxes on tips, Warner said \"you can put as much lipstick on this pig as you want.\"",
      "The Virginia Democrat suggested that the bill could even lose support from Republicans, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\" He added that while Mr. Trump \"has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner,\" the bill \"will come back and bite them.\"",
      "All but two Republicans voted to advance the measure Saturday in a key test vote. But the GOP win came after hours of hand-wringing over whether a handful of Republicans would prevent the legislation from moving forward. The vote remained open for more than three hours Saturday night as holdouts met with Senate GOP leaders to seek assurances on the bill. And Vice President JD Vance was on hand to break a possible tie vote, though his vote ultimately wasn't needed. He joined a meeting with GOP holdouts in the majority leader's office Saturday night.",
      "Vance's presence at the Capitol came as the White House put pressure on Republicans in Congress to get the legislation to the president's desk. In a Truth Social post Saturday night, Mr. Trump indicated he would work to support primary challenges to one of the bill's opponents, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who is up for reelection in 2026.",
      "GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" said Republicans in the House \"know their jobs are at risk\" if they oppose the measure, citing pressure from the president and the American people themselves. He said \"our base back home will not reelect us to office if we vote no on this.\"",
      "\"Everyone in the House, they know the peril they're in if they vote no on this thing,\" McCaul said.",
      "The Texas Republicans said he plans to support the measure when it returns to the House due to its funding for border security and defense, along with the tax cut extensions. And he predicted that it will see support even among fiscal hawks who have expressed opposition to the legislation.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think they're going to vote for it,\" McCaul said.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 29, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. He is the Vice Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Good morning.",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been, probably, sleep-deprived with all of what is happening, but I want to ask you about what's going on in Capitol Hill. Republicans are going to pass this along party lines. It's expected, right? But, it includes things in here that Democrats, including you, had supported, right? The no taxes on tips provision, more money for Border Patrol, expansion of the Child Care Tax Credit upwards of $2,000. Why vote against it, when there are popular provisions within it, and doesn't that just allow the President to say, oh, you want to raise taxes?",
      "SEN. WARNER: You can put as much lipstick on this pig as you want. This will- this will be a political albatross for the Republicans --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Why? --",
      "SEN. WARNER: \u00a0-- because it takes 16 million Americans off of health care coverage with cuts to Medicaid, and cuts to the Obamacare marketplace. That will move us, as a nation, back to the same percentage of uninsured we had before- before Obamacare. And, it's not like these people are not going to get sick. They're going to show up at the emergency room. Rural hospitals are going to shut down. That has been evidenced across the nation. It also goes after food assistance. So we are really in such a place that we're cutting, in my state, a couple hundred thousand people off of school lunches, school breakfasts. They even cut food banks. It's- it's cruel. They have also ended up, at the end of the day, cutting 20,000-plus clean energy jobs. And for what? This was to make sure that the highest, most wealthy Americans can get an extra tax-break. And, as you just saw on your chyron, there, it adds $4.5 trillion to the debt. I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their convictions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of the Republicans are arguing, well, we have to deal with these entitlements and the work requirements and things that may lead to some of the lack of qualifications you talk about. They're not that burdensome. It's volunteer work or part-time work. So, are you overstating it?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No. It's 16 million Americans off of health care. You know, Medicaid cuts- these numbers, they're not my numbers. They're all independent sources. And what- the thing that I don't think people have realized is people say, well, Medicaid, I'm not poor. I, maybe, buy my health insurance through the marketplace. Your rates will go up $800 or $900 a month. And that will trickle through the whole rest of the healthcare market, because if you suddenly take people out of the system, they show up at the emergency room in uncompensated care. The only way those costs get passed on, is higher health insurance to all of us who have traditional coverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if this is so against their own interest, why haven't you been able to peel more Republicans away?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I think we'll see. Even as recently as just an hour ago, some of the special Medicaid provisions for certain states, I think, were disallowed because of the so-called Byrd Rule. It's not over until it's over. I will give you- I will grant that President Trump has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner. At the other end, this bill will come back and bite them. This is going to do so much damage in terms of, not only health care, food assistance, you know, the whole notion that we are moving towards cleaner energy jobs, all on the chopping block, adding $4 trillion to the debt.\u00a0Tell me, at the end of the day, how that is good for America? I don't think you can make the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Education is another front in this fight with the President. And I want to ask you about what's happening in Virginia. We saw the University of Virginia's President, James Ryan, resign on Friday. This was extraordinary. This was a pressure campaign from the Trump administration over diversity, or so-called DEI programs. In the letter, and I want to read this, Ryan wrote that if he had tried to fight back, hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld. But, he resigned to avoid this. Is that now the playbook for other university presidents: walk away, don't have the fight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: This is the most outrageous action, I think, this crowd has taken on education. We have great public universities in Virginia. We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the Governor. Jim Ryan had done a very good job; just completed a major capital campaign. For him to be threatened, and, literally, there was indication that they received the letter that if he didn't resign on a day last week, by five o'clock, all these cuts would take place. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- It was that explicit? --",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- It was that explicit. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is- but that sounds personal. That doesn't sound specific to policy or changes. Like, how does the next university president get in line and get the money?",
      "SEN. WARNER: You're shocked it's coming- personal attacks are coming out of this administration? This is, you know- I thought the Republicans were about states' rights. I thought the Republicans were about, let's transfer more power in the States. This federal D.O.E. and Department of Justice should get their nose out of University of Virginia. They are doing damage to our flagship university. And if they can do it here, they'll do it elsewhere. At the end of the day, I understand that, with so many things at stake, that the idea, and I think Jim Ryan laid it out, that he was going to make his personal- personal job more important than these cuts. But, boy, that shouldn't have been the choice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and we know that the universe that the administration is looking at more universities, and the assistant A.G., Harmeet Dhillon, indicated that publicly, and University of California is next to the crosshairs, so we're going to be watching that carefully --",
      "SEN. WARNER: They all want to make them like Harvard. They want to take on public universities, the way they have now taken on the Ivys. End of the day, this is going to hurt our\u00a0universities, chase away what world-class talent. And, frankly, if we don't have some level of academic freedom, then what kind of country are we?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your oversight role on intelligence. You were briefed on what's going on with Iran. You said you fear the American people are being given a false sense of comfort with these declarations of mission accomplished. Do you believe U.S. intelligence knows how much of a capability Iran maintains now?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I don't think we have final assessments. Let me- first of all, we don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Secondly, the military performed an extraordinary mission, and I think they affected a great deal of damage to Iran's facilities. But, the idea that the President of the United States, with no data, two hours after the strike, is suddenly hitting the standard of saying total obliteration. That leads us to think that they are out of the game, and we don't know that yet. And, let's just be clear, you can actually set back the major program where they were trying to create, potentially, and there'd been no decision made by the Ayatollah to actually move towards weaponization, but where they could have a weaponized system with a dozen-plus missiles that are nuclear warned. But what they don't know is they didn't, and this was appropriate, I'm not criticizing the administration; they didn't go after the enriched uranium that was Isfahan, at that base, because it's buried so deeply --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- They just hit it with Tomahawks, not the bunker-busters --",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- So, the fact that they can have, still, enriched uranium, they may have some ability to still cascade that- means they could\u00a0still move forward on something, that might be not delivered by a missile, but a bomb in a trunk of a car. And all I don't want is the American people, or, for that matter, our allies in the region, to rely on a term that was set by the President before he had any facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Point taken there on the specifics of the rudimentary bomb. But, coming back to what you just said, there had been no decision by the Supreme Leader to make a weapon. Secretary of State Rubio, on this program, last Sunday, told me it was irrelevant, the answer to that question, because Iran had everything it needed to make and build a weapon. So, based on what you know, was there an emergency? Was there a reason the US had to act in the moment it did?",
      "SEN. WARNER:\u00a0 We were on the verge of what could have been a much greater war, in terms of Iran and Israel spreading to the whole region. Was there the imminent emergency that would trigger? Because lots of presidents have looked at taking this action, I think that's- that's very debatable. If, at the end of the day, we end up where this peace holds, and Iran doesn't strike back, Hallelujah. But, what we don't know, for example, is Iran going to try to hit us on cyber with this administration cutting, literally, half of our cyber-security personnel in this country? So, I just want to make sure that we- we do this in a measured way. The military did great. We have set them back. But let's not pretend that they don't have any capabilities. And the only way we can get resolution on that, Margaret, and Secretary Rubio acknowledged this in the brief, is if we have boots on the ground with inspectors. That means we've got to go to diplomacy. If America and Iran start negotiating this week, face-to-face, that would be good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we were- we will talk to the man who directs those boots on the grounds, potentially, the inspectors later on in the program from the IAEA. Thank you very much, Senator. We're going to have to leave it there. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the nearly two-year war in the Gaza Strip.

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Republicans released the latest version of President Trump's massive spending and tax bill late Friday as the GOP eyes an ambitious July 4 deadline to approve the centerpiece legislation of the president's second-term agenda.",
      "After the House narrowly approved the legislation that addresses the president's tax, defense, border and energy priorities last month, Senate Republicans have been putting their imprint on the bill. But GOP leaders are seeking a middle ground to appease the upper chamber without alienating House Republicans, who will have to approve the Senate's changes before the bill can head to the president's desk for his signature. The Senate voted Saturday to advance the measure, overcoming a key hurdle as the upper chamber works toward final passage.",
      "At the center of the bill is an extension to Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, slated to sunset at year's end, seeking to make the cuts permanent in what has been a key priority for Senate Republicans. It also includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs.",
      "But along with different dynamics in the Senate, Republicans have also been contending with input from the Senate's rulekeeper, known as the parliamentarian. She has been weighing in on the bill's components to determine whether they may fly under the reconciliation process, which allows the GOP to move forward with the bill without any support from across the aisle.",
      "Here's what's in the Senate's updated version of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" some of which remains in flux:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in the Senate in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $25 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "However, Alaska and Hawaii would receive temporary exemptions from the cost-sharing requirement. Both states would receive a two-year reprieve if the Department of Agriculture determines they are \"actively implementing a corrective action plan.\"",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18-64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could also receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill, as Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, outlining that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct up to $25,000 for tip wages and $12,500 for overtime. But the provisions would expire in 2028. The Senate bill would reduce the deductions for individuals making over $150,000, while the House bill does not include income limits.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",
      "Asylum fee",
      "The legislation also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and other fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "AI moratorium",
      "A revised proposal on a 10-year moratorium on state regulations on artificial intelligence also made it into the Senate bill. The updated provision provides federal aid to states as long as they do not regulate AI. According to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, the parliamentarian determined that the provision is in compliance \"as long as the conditions only apply to the new $500 million provided by the reconciliation bill.\"",

      "William F. Buckley (1925-2008), founder of the National Review and host of the TV debate show \"Firing Line,\" was a leading political commentator who catalyzed America's conservative movement with his support of such figures as Joseph McCarthy, Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan.",
      "In his new biography, \"Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America\" (published by Random House), historian Sam Tanenhaus (author of books on Whittaker Chambers and Louis Armstrong) writes about the life and influence of Buckley, whose drive to push America to the right would alter the Republican Party and lead to the rise of Donald Trump.",

      "Connecticut Yanquis",
      "William F. Buckley, Jr., the intellectual leader of the modern conservative movement, rightly saw himself less as founder than heir. Everything he learned, and all he became, began at home.",
      "It started with his father, William F. Buckley, Sr., a lawyer, real estate investor, and oil speculator who grew up in the brush country, the scrubland frontier, of Duval County in South Texas. He was thirty-five and had made his first fortune when, on a visit to New Orleans, he met twenty-two-year-old Aloise Steiner, the eldest of three sisters of Swiss and German background\u2014\"the very essence of old New Orleans charm,\" said one of the many men smitten by her. She had a year or two of college, played Mozart on the piano, and told captivating if not always quite credible stories\u2014for instance, of the fourteen marriage proposals she claimed to have turned down before W.F. Buckley began courting her in the spring of 1917.",
      "The physical attraction was immediate, almost electric. Many years later the couple's children remembered the \"frisson\" that connected their parents. The couple also shared a deep and abiding Catholic faith. After the wedding ceremony at the Steiner family's parish church, Mater Dolorosa on South Carrollton Avenue, on December 29, 1917, the Buckleys began their married life in Mexico. W.F. Buckley had been living there since 1908. He had apartments and law offices in Mexico City as well as in Tampico\u2014the oil boomtown on the Gulf where, after building a prosperous law practice writing oil leases, he had gone into real estate and then into oil, borrowing substantial sums to sink five wells on the banks of the Panuco River.",
      "Oil speculation was always a high-risk venture, but especially in Mexico. It was in the throes of the twentieth century's first great revolution, its ten-year-long \"bloody fiesta,\"\u2009which ended in 1920 with the rout of the right-wing faction Buckley had supported and the election of a new president he despised. It was a stinging defeat, and he would never get over it. Yet he also could say, and often did\u2014to his children most emphatically\u2014that although he had lost, he had done so on his terms, without giving an inch to the opposition. Other oilmen, including some far wealthier and more powerful than he, had submitted to the new order and made lucrative deals with each fresh regime. W.F. Buckley refused to do it. He left Mexico\u2014in fact was expelled by order of its government\u2014with debts totaling one million dollars. In later years he showed his children a treasured souvenir from those times, an architect's sketch of the grand palacio, with private chapel, which W.F. Buckley had planned to build on substantial property he had purchased in Coyoacan.",
      "Bankrupt at age forty, Buckley would have to start all over. He had a family to support, his wife and three small children, now living with his mother and two sisters in Austin, Texas. But there was a new opportunity. In fact, having to put Mexico behind him might be for the best. The oil fields in its Golden Lane were nearly tapped out. The great new oil patch was in Venezuela. Once again there were large profits to be made but also many hazards\u2014in this case \"hostile Indian tribes,\" as well as malaria and fatal \"liver and intestinal disorders.\" Visitors were advised to stay no longer than a few weeks.",
      "For W.F. Buckley admonitions were a goad. He went to Venezuela, stayed a full six months, and came back in 1924 with leasing rights to three million acres surrounding Lake Maracaibo, spreading east and west, a complexly organized checker-board whose squares \"in practically every instance adjoin properties that are being actively developed by major American oil companies,\" it was reported at the time. The concession was \"rated among the most valuable in Venezuela.\"",
      "Buckley, now based in New York, formed a new company, Pantepec (named for a river in Mexico), and with the sponsorship of the Wall Street broker Edward A. Pierce floated stock shares and secured investments from two California majors: Union Oil and California Petroleum. Matching wits against some of the finest legal minds in the United States, W.F. Buckley worked out the terms for an innovative \"farm-out.\" In return for gaining temporary control of a third of the holdings, the two behemoths would cover the costs of exploration and drilling and reap most of the profits once oil was struck. W.F. Buckley would be allotted a tiny fraction of those profits, and he now had funds to send teams of engineers and geologists to explore the remaining two million acres.",
      "Remade as a Wall Street speculator, W.F. Buckley bought a suite of offices on lower Park Avenue and furnished them sumptuously, the better to impress investors. He also bought an apartment building nearby where he stayed alone during the week. Jazz Age Manhattan, with its speakeasies and fleshpots and lurking criminal element, was no place for his wife and growing family. They lived on his third shrewd purchase, a large estate in the rural northwest corner of Connecticut.",
      "On Fridays, the work week finished, W.F. Buckley walked a few blocks uptown from his office to Grand Central and rode the train home to his family, three full hours through exurban New York\u2014Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess counties\u2014all the way to Amenia, where a Buick sat idling with the Black \"houseboy,\" James Cole of New Orleans, behind the wheel in a chauffeur's cap. Together they drove three miles along a country road and, if daylight remained, enjoyed the vista\u2014the wooded Litchfield Hills and the dipping valley, the bright quilt of dairy farms\u2014and then crossed the Connecticut state line at Sharon, a picturesque village of fifteen hundred, incorporated in 1739 and named for the fertile Biblical plain. A favorite weekend and summer getaway for wealthy New Yorkers, Sharon was famous for its narrow elongated green, originally grazing land, which gracefully stretched for more than a mile from its north end\u2014with storefronts and wooden walkways where in summer elms arched overhead, the branches on either side touching to form a canopy\u2014to South Main Street. There, near the town hall and the Hotchkiss Library, stood what is still today Sharon's chief landmark: a granite-and-brownstone clock tower, forty feet high with a pyramid roof, built in the 1880s by the same firm that designed Theodore Roosevelt's Sagamore Hill estate on Oyster Bay, Long Island.",
      "On either side of South Main, set back from the street, were large and imposing manor houses. The Buckleys lived in one of them, Number 32, called the Ansel Sterling House after its first owner, a lawyer and judge twice elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1820s. Sterling had purchased the property in 1808 and then torn down the original brick, replacing it with a Georgian frame structure. Over time the ten-acre property had tripled to thirty acres, beautiful and lush, with thick stands of oaks and sugar maples, outbuildings including barn, stables, and icehouse, and horse trails that wound through the rolling pastures and up into the gentle hills beyond. Today Ansel Sterling's house still stands, though much enlarged by W.F. Buckley. Its handsome entrance with pediment and pillars stares across Main Street at Sharon's two historic churches: little Christ Church Episcopal, with its witch-hat spire, and the Congregational church, the town's oldest.",
      "In 1923, when W.F. Buckley first toured the property and rented it for the summer, its most striking feature was the elm that towered up from its front lawn. It had been planted in colonial times by Sharon's most illustrious forefather, the Congregational minister Reverend Cotton Mather Smith, a descendant of Cotton Mather. It was now the largest elm in the entire state, its immense trunk measuring eighteen feet around. In 1924, the same year Main Street was paved for motor traffic, Buckley bought the estate outright and renamed it Great Elm.",
      "This was the new life Buckley had conjured in a few short years, seemingly pulled out of thinnest air, for his wife and growing family. So promising did the future look that when a sixth child was born on November 24, 1925, husband and wife agreed that this son, their third, should be his father's namesake: William F. Buckley, Jr.",
      "It was always an event when \"Father\" came home. The children who were not away at school or upstairs in the nursery crowded in front of the house to greet him. \"We'd wait there for his car to come,\" one of his six daughters remembered, \"and make bets on which car would be Father's.\" He was delighted to see them, but even happier to see his wife. \"He'd kiss us all and he'd say, 'Where's your mother?' Mother would come and say, 'Darling,' and the two of them would walk out together.\"",
      "No one felt these currents more keenly than Billy Buckley, who had the middle child's fear of being overlooked, lost in the crowd. And the Buckley siblings really were a crowd: ten in all, many of them very close in age, five born ahead of Billy and four after. With servants added, as well as tutors, workmen, groomsmen for the horses, and later a riding instructor and his family, the household numbered more than twenty and was alive with pranks, schemes, hilarity, and strife.",

    "story": [
      "For decades, William F. Buckley Jr. was a one-of-a-kind character: an author and columnist, and a celebrity intellectual. He hosted a TV debate show, \"Firing Line,\" and was often a guest on late night television. But beyond that stardom and upper-crust accent was something consequential: Bill Buckley was a conservative who sought to propel the nation to the right.",
      "\"Buckley invented cultural politics,\" said former New York Times Book Review Editor Sam Tanenhaus. He says we are still living in the world created by Buckley, who died in 2008. (He would have turned 100 this year.)",
      "I asked, \"Is there a line from Buckley to McCarthy, to Goldwater, to Nixon, to Reagan, to Gingrich, to Trump?\"",
      "\"You have just drawn the fever chart or outline of the modern Republican Party in America,\" Tanenhaus replied. \"He's the founder of the movement we have today.\"",
      "Tanenhaus' sweeping new biography is \"Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America.\"",
      "Buckley's beginnings can be traced back to Yale University, which now houses an extensive archive of his personal papers.",
      "Buckley burst onto the national scene in 1951 with his book, \"God and Man at Yale,\" which took on his alma mater as a thicket of secular professors and liberal elites.",
      "Tanenhaus said, \"He was 25 years old, handsome Ivy League graduate who has everything going for him, but he's also gonna reveal the secrets of the ivory tower.\"",
      "In 1955, he founded National Review, seeking to provide conservatives with coverage of their ideas and debates. (I once worked there as a Buckley fellow and reporter).",
      "Though he never held office himself, Buckley caused a stir when he ran for mayor of New York City in 1965, and mused that if he won, he would demand a recount. \"He was really turning the party inside out,\" Tanenhaus said. \"He was going to make the Republican Party the voice of the excluded middle class.\"",
      "But as he built his new coalition, he also drew scrutiny and denunciations, especially on race. In the Fifties and Sixties, Buckley opposed key civil rights legislation, and supported segregation.",
      "And he had his critics. Buckley's views were rebuked at high-profile debates, be it with James Baldwin or Gore Vidal.",
      "Tanenhaus says, by the late sixties, Buckley was seen as a central force, boosting Richard Nixon and, in 1980, Ronald Reagan, who won the presidency",
      "\"Bill Buckley reached his peak under Richard Nixon, because Nixon needed Buckley,\" Tanenhaus said. Reagan, however, did not: \"Reagan was a great pragmatist, and he knew that Buckley was still a movement guy.\"",
      "Then came a new generation of louder, brasher conservatives, starting with Rush Limbaugh. And in Washington, there was Newt Gingrich, who won the Speaker's gavel in 1994.",
      "Asked what he believed Buckley thought of the rising stars of the right in the 1990s, Gingrich said, \"I think we amused him. He was proof that conservatism could be smart, and that you could win the argument. Buckley was a model of thinking about things and to say things that are true but not acceptable.\"",
      "Gingrich, now a close ally of President Donald Trump, says the flame of Buckley still flickers inside the GOP. \u00a0\"Much of the critique that Buckley made at Yale of the intellectuals is the underlying fuel for Trump's assault on the Ivy League,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"You see echoes of Buckley in what President Trump's doing with the universities today?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"What's the difference in your view between Buckley's conservatism and President Trump's conservatism?\"",
      "\"Trump is the most effective anti-liberal in my lifetime,\" Gingrich said. \"I think Trump focuses on doing and achieving more than on knowing. I think Buckley thought his role was to be a genuine intellectual. And that meant, obviously, he wouldn't be a particularly good politician.\"",
      "Tanenhaus says William F. Buckley Jr's legacy is complicated. His civility certainly stands out: \"He wants to defeat you, but he's gonna defeat you with his vocabulary. And that is an aspect of democracy that's been lost.\"",
      "Yet, for the biographer, there is also an inescapable conclusion: Buckley paved the way for Trump: \"If Trump is able, if he succeeds in some of the big things he means to do, then he may emerge as the single most powerful figure to come out of the movement William F. Buckley Jr. created all those years ago.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 29, 2025. The interview was taped on June 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, welcome to the program.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Thank you very much, Margaret. Good to talk to you again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director General, there is so much happening. I'm hoping you can walk us through what you know. Iran's foreign minister has said that the damage to their nuclear facilities from the U.S. bombing is significant and serious. We know Israel has also killed a number of top Iranian nuclear scientists. What exactly is Iran's capability at this moment?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, yes, and I think you can pick and choose any adjective to characterize this, but you will see that there is an agreement in describing this as a very serious level of damage. It can be, you know, described in different ways, but it's clear that what happened in particular in Fordo, Natanz, Isfahan, where Iran used to have and still has, to some degree, capabilities in terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment of uranium have been destroyed to an important degree. Some is still standing. So there is, of course, an important setback in terms of those- of those capabilities. This is- this is clear. And now the important issue- the important thing is, what are the next steps? Now the characterization of the damage, I think we can, you know, speculate, and still, until, of course, the Iranians themselves will have to go there and sift through the, you know, rubble and look at what is the exact degree of the damage. At some point, the IAEA will have to return. Although our job is not to assess damage, but to re-establish the knowledge of the activities that take place there, and the access to the material, which is very, very important, the material that they will be producing if they continue with this activity. This is contingent on other, you see, everything is connected. This is- this is contingent on negotiations which may or may not restart, so- so what we see this here, I think we have a snapshot of- of- of a program which has been very seriously damaged, to quote Dr. Araghchi. And now what we need to focus on is on the next steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned there diplomacy. President Trump has been calling for diplomatic talks with Iran to settle all the issues around the nuclear program. I know you were in regular contact with envoy Steve Witkoff. Are you talking to him now? Will the IAEA be involved in any agreement?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, at some point we will have to be, because if his efforts, which I support wholeheartedly, succeed, this will come to a point where there is some agreement, some understanding on things that Iran will continue doing, and some things where there could be an agreement on certain restrictions. And of course, who is going to verify that is the IAEA so this is why we're in constant contact. Now they need to reconnect. And it's not going to be easy, one can imagine, after the traumatic events that took place. Even for us, you may have seen that I wrote to Foreign Minister Araghchi a few days ago, immediately, I would say, after the cease-fire was considered to be holding, and I said to him that we should perhaps sit down and analyze in a gradual way the reconnection, the modalities for the inspectors to go- to go back. So there is a level where the IAEA is not involved, and this is the direct conversation. What is the deal? And then, of course, we will be connecting to make sure that that deal stands and it's verifiable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to that point, Tehran just passed a law saying they want to suspend cooperation with the IAEA inspectors. The foreign minister said he had no plans to let you personally, Mr. Director General, into the country. Does that mean Iran will completely block all inspectors? Do those you already have in the country have any access?",
      "GROSSI: Well, certainly I hope this is not the case. I think that what the foreign minister said is that they were looking into this law and how this law would impact our activities. I think it's time- this is why it's so important that we sit down around the table and we look into this. Iran- and I think nobody has put that in question, and I hope nobody will, is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, like more than 190 countries in the world. So- so, that implies that they have to work with the- with the agency. So we have to go- we have been going through this law that they have, that the Majles approved, and we see that they are talking about cooperation on the basis of- of the security and the safety of their sites. I think that is not incompatible with the inspection work that needs to take place. But of course, it's not Rafael Grossi and Margaret Brennan discussing this that we are going to solve it. I think we- I have to sit down with- with- with Iran and look into this, because at the end of the day, this whole thing, after the military strikes, will have to have a long lasting solution, which cannot be but a diplomatic one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're not kicking- they're not kicking out your inspectors at this point?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Not in this sense. I would not say that I am looking with interest and with some concern what they have approved. But of course, it's their law. It is their parliament. But you know, here there are legal implications. An international treaty, of course, takes precedence. You cannot invoke an internal law not to abide with an international treaty. But Iran is not saying that at the moment, and I think this is constructive. So this is why I think we have to go down into the details, because the work will have to continue, otherwise nobody will have an idea of what is happening in Iran. Iran will continue with a nuclear program, the contours of which are still to be seen and will be I am sure, part of these negotiations, which I hope, will be resuming soon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran officially reported weeks ago that they were going to take measures in advance of these strikes to try to protect their nuclear assets. Did they share with the IAEA what those plans were? Where they were going to stash things like centrifuges, the machines that help enrich fuel? Where they were going to put the gas canisters that have enriched uranium?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: No, no, they did not inform that- that to us, but at the same time, there was no physical time, perhaps, to do it. Iran, for example, had announced to us that they had a new enrichment facility in Isfahan, and we were going to go on the 13th of June to- to check on that facility so that- and the site has been severely damaged and hit. So this is why I say it is indispensable. We will have to, aggravation or not, feelings and emotions or not, there has to come a point with- with cool heads. We sit around the table and- and see what- I mean, these protective measures, of course, it's their right to protect their assets, like any other sovereign nation. They can, of course, protect- but they know and there are, I don't want to get too technical or legalese here in this conversation, but there are provisions in the agreements we have, not only with Iran, with any- with any country. If a country at a- at a moment, feels that some of the things we inspect must be protected or whatever, they have to tell us, and we have to go, etc., etc., as you can imagine. So, this could not happen because of the unfolding of the circumstances, of a military conflict where, of course, you know, decisions are taken and this is not planned or announced, obviously. So now- now it's the time to reconnect and to talk and to talk to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, but there was roughly 400 kilograms, which is just under 900 pounds, of highly enriched uranium, before the attacks. I know these are in small canisters and relatively easy to move. Do you have any idea where that was moved, and if it was moved before the attack?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: We presume, and I think it's- it's logical to presume that when they announce that they are going to be taking protective measures, this could be part of it. But, as I said, we don't know where this material could be, or if part of it could have been, you know, under the attack during those 12 days. So some could have been destroyed as part of the attack, but some could have been moved. So there has to be at some point a clarification. If we don't get that clarification, this will continue to be hanging, you know, over our heads as- as a potential problem. So this is why I say it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I ask you about what things might still remain, because there's that open question of could Iran sprint towards a bomb even now, if they wanted to. If we don't know where the highly enriched uranium is and cannot account for all the centrifuges, is that still a risk that they could be rushing towards a bomb?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, you know, I- we don't want to be alarmists here, and I don't want to be part of, you know, a messaging that would be spreading, as I say, alarm. But we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened. Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there. The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily. You are going to have an agreement. You are going to have an inspection system that will give everybody, everybody in the region and- and- and elsewhere, the assurances that we can- we can definitely turn the page.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So up until right before the strikes, the IAEA still had inspectors, as I understand it, going to some of these sites. There's been a lot of focus here in America on the trucks and satellite images of them outside of Fordo. What was happening in those days before the strike?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, as- as you were pointing out there were- there was an announcement of protective measures that could have included moving equipment and material. We don't know. We saw the same images that the whole world has seen of these trucks, and we don't want to get into any rush conclusion about it, but it is, it is clear that we need the things that we ignore, okay. And after a reasonable period, after the war, there has to be a process that needs to continue. Otherwise the uncertainties will continue, will continue to linger on. And this is, you know, in a final analysis, not good, and perhaps even preventing a good agreement, because who is going to have an agreement where you don't know what the counterpart really has? What are the assets that they really have after the- after this- this- this military campaign that took place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So up until these strikes Iran- Iran was still disclosing information to the IAEA--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: --Well yes, yes, yes, yes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013-In certain amounts--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: There were deficits. There were deficits, and we were referring to those in the- in the sense that there were some things that they were not clarifying to us. But our inspection work was- was constant. In particular, in this sensitive area of the number of centrifuges and the amount of material, we had perfect view. We didn't have view on other things that we wanted to have. But on this one, it was- it was complete. It was comprehensive. And, of course, at the moment, there is- there is nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran wasn't keeping its stockpile of enriched uranium secret. The world was concerned--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: --No--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You said you were concerned about it. What do you think it was intended for? And did you see anything that suggested they were looking to weaponize?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: They- let me be clear here, because we said, first of all, something very, very important. They have all these capabilities, but for the agency, they- first of all, they didn't have nuclear weapons. Okay? This needs to be said. One can have an assessment nationally that they were close, okay? And I don't get into that, because we, the IAEA, does not judge intentions. The IAEA looks at the activities of a country and reports it to the world. So it is countries that- that say, well, this is of concern or not. What we were concerning- what- what I was concerned about is that there were other things that were not clear. For example, we had found traces of uranium in some places in Iran, which were not the normal declared facilities. And we were asking for years, why did we find these traces of enriched uranium in place x, y or z? And we were simply not getting credible answers. If there was material- where is this material? So there could be even more. We don't know. This is why it is, I'm sorry I'm repeating it for the third time, I think we need to go back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, understood. But your statement and that report that you gave about some of these open questions or unanswered questions, the Iranians are pointing to it now, and the foreign minister seems to be sort of blaming you for the military strikes. He said it wasn't honest and fair, your report. He said, after the facilities, you didn't even condemn the strikes- after the strikes, I should say. What do you make of those criticisms?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well- I, to an extent, I understand. They have been under attack. But, really, who can believe that this conflict happened because of a report of the IAEA? And, by the way, what was- what was in that report was not new, Margaret. We have been saying that for a long time, and in previous reports as well. So, this- maybe it's because it's easier, maybe, to criticize an international organization or a director general, I don't know, but it's not reasonable to say that. And, if anything, the IAEA, as always, has had a very honest assessment of the situation. And there were many, I can assure you, there were many that- that were saying in your report, you must say that they have nuclear weapons, or they are very close to have nuclear weapons. And we didn't. We simply didn't, because this was not what we were seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you also said you couldn't verify that it was a peaceful program.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Absolutely, because we have to see everything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: They did- we didn't see them. We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending. So this is- this is the truth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I appreciate the nuance here, because there's so much gray. People here are looking for clarity, and there's confusion in the United States. CBS is reporting that the Defense Intelligence Agency assesses Iran's program was set back a few months, but once they dig out, they could resume in a number of months. They have to rebuild electrical and water supplies. The CIA and the National Intelligence directors say the facilities were destroyed, and it would take years to rebuild. Israel says the military program is set back many years. What's the truth here? What do you make of these assessments?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: You know- you know what, this hourglass approach in weapons of mass destruction is- is not a good idea. Remember, we had cases 45 minutes and so on, which were quite- quite off spot. All of that depends on your metrics, Margaret. If you tell me it will take them two months or three months, for what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.",
      "Because, first of all, as I- and I think the intelligence- we are not there making any military evaluations, first of all, but, out of the logic of our conversation, it is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all. And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again. This is again- and I'm sorry, fourth time, we have to go back to the table and have a technically sound solution to this. Otherwise, this will come hit us again, in terms of a situation which is not well clarified. And this is an opportunity. We do have an opportunity now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, and we will see if that opportunity is picked up by either side. Director General, thank you for your time today.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Thank you, as always, a pleasure. Thank you very much.",

    "summary": "Congress is racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the tax and spending bill to the president.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted to advance President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" late Saturday night, in a key test for the tax and spending measure ahead of a final vote expected in the coming days.",
      "In a 51 to 49 vote, all but two Republicans voted to advance the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, following hours of delay as the GOP appeared to iron out last-minute details and support. The vote stayed open for more than three hours as holdouts sought assurances from GOP leaders before supporting moving forward on the measure.",
      "Vice President JD Vance came to Capitol Hill Saturday night in case he would need to cast a tie-breaking vote, which he ultimately did not.",
      "Sens. Thom Tillis and Rand Paul were the only two Republicans to vote against the measure. In a Truth Social post Saturday night as the roll call vote dragged on, Mr. Trump indicated he would work to support primary challenges to Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026.",
      "\"Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against 'Senator Thom' Tillis,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks, looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina and, so importantly, the United States of America.\"",
      "The vote came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Friday he wasn't certain he had the votes to advance the bill, as the upper chamber awaited decisions on whether a number of provisions complied with the Senate's reconciliation rules, which allow Republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority. Major policy disputes also remained.",
      "Senate Republicans did not release an updated version of their bill until late Friday night, giving senators little time to digest it before taking an initial procedural vote that's necessary to move toward final passage.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressured Congress to send him the sprawling package \u2014 which includes tax cuts and funding for his immigration and defense priorities \u2014 by the Fourth of July holiday.",
      "In a statement, obtained by CBS News on Saturday, the White House said that a failure to pass the bill would be the \"ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reflects the shared priorities of both the Congress and the Administration. Therefore, the Congress should immediately pass this bill and send it to the President's desk by July 4, 2025, to show the American people that they are serious about 'promises made, promises kept,'\" the statement said. \"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "In the bill, Republicans proposed slashing funding for Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income individuals and people with disabilities, and food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 or food stamps \u2014 to help pay for those priorities.",
      "Over the last week, the Senate parliamentarian determined that some of the most controversial provisions in the package violated a rule that governs the reconciliation process, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending. The rulings directed Republicans to either drop those sections from the package or rewrite them.",
      "Meanwhile, in the leadup to the vote, disputes over Medicaid spending cuts, the state and local tax deduction and a planned debt ceiling increase still lingered among Republicans.",
      "In a promising sign for Senate leadership hours ahead of the vote, two Republican senators who expressed opposition to provisions in the bill said they would vote to advance it.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she would not vote against the measure advancing, but noted that did not indicate her vote on final passage.",
      "\"If the bill is not further changed, I would be leaning against the bill,\" Collins said Saturday afternoon.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has criticized the bill's Medicaid cuts, said he will be a \"yes\" vote on final passage because his state will be receiving more funding for the program.",
      "\"With the delay in the provider tax framework that we were able to get and with the changes to the rural hospital fund, Missouri's Medicaid dollars will actually increase over the next four years. So we will get more money \u2014 Medicaid funding \u2014 over baseline until 2030. Any changes to our provider framework in Missouri will not take place until the next decade,\" Hawley said Saturday.",
      "\"I want to be clear, I'm going to spend the next however long trying to make sure that the cuts that we have successfully delayed never take place,\" Hawley said. \"I think that this effort to cut Medicaid funding is a mistake. We've been able for Missouri to delay it. As I said, we're actually going to get more money in the next four years. But that's not true of all the states.\"",
      "However, as a possible vote drew closer Saturday, a handful of Senate Republicans remained publicly opposed. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said he would vote against advancing the bill and would be a \"no\" on final passage. And Paul of Kentucky and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin had been vocal about their opposition in recent weeks, citing concern about its impact on the national deficit.",
      "Paul was among a handful of Republican senators who golfed with the president Saturday, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. Asked whether Paul could be convinced to support the bill, Graham said, \"There's some things we might be able to do if we need to, but I don't think he'll vote for final passage.\"",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate Republicans could only afford to lose three votes with all Democrats voting against the legislation.",
      "House Republicans narrowly passed a version of the bill in May. and the lower chamber is expected to be called back to Washington to vote on the Senate version if it survives the upper chamber in the coming days. But House Republicans have warned that any major changes made by the Senate put its ability to make it through the House again at risk.",
      "Thune said on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon that \"53 members will never agree on every detail of legislation.\" But he urged that Republicans are \"united in our commitment to what we're doing in this bill.\"",
      "\"It's time to get this legislation across the finish line,\" Thune added.",
      "But Democrats, without the ability to block the bill from passing, pledged to drag out the process. According to a source, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York told Senate Democrats to prepare for a full reading of the legislation on the floor, which would delay a vote on final passage by hours.",
      "The minority leader announced the move immediately following Saturday's vote.",
      "\"Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical bill released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don't realize what's in it,\" Schumer said. \"If Senate Republicans won't tell the American people what's in this bill, then Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish.\"",

      "\"The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country,\" Musk wrote on X on Saturday as the Senate was scheduled to call a vote to open debate on the nearly 1,000-page bill. \"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\"",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, whose birthday is also Saturday, later posted that the bill would be \"political suicide for the Republican Party.\"",
      "The criticisms reopen a recent fiery conflict between the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency and the administration he recently left. They also represent yet another headache for Republican Senate leaders who have spent the weekend working overtime to get the legislation through their chamber so it can pass by Mr. Trump's Fourth of July deadline.",
      "Musk has previously made his opinions about Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" clear. In late May, just a few days before he officially left his post in the federal government, he told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" he was \"disappointed\" with the bill's price tag.",
      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told CBS News.",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk added. \"But I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.\"",
      "Following a laudatory celebration in the Oval Office, his language became more aggressive and he blasted the bill as \"pork-filled\" and a \"disgusting abomination.\"",
      "\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,\" he wrote on X earlier this month. In another post, the wealthy GOP donor who had recently forecasted that he'd step back from political donations threatened to fire lawmakers who \"betrayed the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump clapped back to say he was disappointed with Musk, back-and-forth fighting erupted and quickly escalated. Musk suggested without evidence that Mr. Trump, who spent the first part of the year as one of his closest allies, was mentioned in files related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The president also threatened to cut off federal subsidies and contracts to Elon Musk's companies. SpaceX receives tens of billions of dollars in federal money, most of which are in the form of federal grants from NASA.",
      "\"He's got a lot of money, he gets a lot of subsidy,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on June 6. \"So we'll take a look at that. Only if it's fair for him and for the country. I would certainly think about it, but it has to be fair.\"",
      "Musk ultimately tried to make nice with the administration, saying he regretted some of his posts that \"went too far.\" Trump responded in kind in an interview with The New York Post, saying, \"Things like that happen. I don't blame him for anything.\"",
      "The shocking rift came after Musk donated $277 million to Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and other Republican candidates in the last election cycle, according to campaign finance records.",

      "Late last month, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a 60-day ceasefire. Under that proposal, Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages who were taken to Gaza during Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel, according to a copy obtained by CBS News. Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners, 1,111 Palestinian detainees and 180 deceased Palestinians as part of the deal.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a group of Maryland parents who challenged their school district's decision to deny them the ability to opt their elementary-aged children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "The high court said in a 6-3 decision\u00a0in the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor that the government burdens parents' religious exercise when it requires their children to participate in instruction that violates the families' religious beliefs. Justice Samuel Alito authored the majority opinion, with the three liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 in dissent.",
      "The court's conservative majority said that the parents who brought the case are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuits proceed. The high court ordered the board to notify parents in advance when one of the story books at issue in the case will be used, and allow them to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "\"[W]e hold that the Board's introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks \u2014 combined with its decision to withhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs \u2014 substantially interferes with the religious development of their children and imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise\" that the court has previously ruled is unacceptable, Alito wrote.",
      "\"We reject this chilling vision of the power of the state to strip away the critical right of parents to guide the religious development of their children,\" Alito added later in the opinion.",
      "Sotomayor read her dissent aloud from the bench. In her opinion, she wrote, \"Simply being exposed to beliefs contrary to your own\" does not amount to prohibiting the free exercise of religion.",
      "\"The result will be chaos for this nation's public schools. Requiring schools to provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent's religious beliefs will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,\" Sotomayor wrote, later warning that it would force courts to resolve a \"new font\" of litigation and leave judges as the decision-makers on policies governing school material related to gender and sexuality.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education and Montgomery County Public Schools said in response to the decision that they are developing next steps and will provide further guidance to schools and families before the start of the next school year.",
      "\"This decision complicates our work creating a welcoming, inclusive, and equitable school system. It also sends a chilling message to many valued members of our diverse community,\" the board and school district said in a joint statement. \"Montgomery County Public Schools remains a welcoming and inclusive school system that embraces and celebrates each and every one of our students. We will maintain an environment where all students feel valued and supported.\"",
      "Mahmoud v. Taylor",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court came in one of three cases before the justices this term that involve religious rights. The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years been sympathetic to plaintiffs raising claims of religious discrimination.",
      "The dispute involves public-school instruction in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is home to the state's largest school system with more than 160,000 students. Montgomery County, like most states, had a policy that allowed parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities to excuse their children, as long as the opt-out requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court filings.",
      "The Montgomery County Education Board added \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks into its English Language Arts curriculum for elementary school students after Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity.\" The school district said it wanted to supplement its Language Arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" The books added include titles like \"Born Ready,\" which is about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" which tells the story of a prince who falls in love with and marries a knight.",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:26:47 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers said their findings suggest husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage \u2013 suggesting a female dominance.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "Dispute apparently settled",
      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",
      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Ancient rocks could shed light on Earth's earliest days",
      "Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas soon after the solar system existed. Primordial rocks often get melted and recycled by Earth's moving tectonic plates, making them extremely rare on the surface today. Scientists have uncovered 4 billion-year-old rocks from another formation in Canada called the Acasta Gneiss Complex, but the Nuvvuagittuq rocks could be even older.",
      "Studying rocks from Earth's earliest history could give a glimpse into how the planet may have looked - how its roiling magma oceans gave way to tectonic plates - and even how life got started.",
      "\"To have a sample of what was going on on Earth way back then is really valuable,\" said Mark Reagan with the University of Iowa, who studies volcanic rocks and lava and was not involved with the new study.",
      "Inuit community wants steps to avoid rocks being exploited",
      "The rock formation is on tribal Inukjuak lands and the local Inuit community has temporarily restricted scientists from taking samples from the site due to damage from previous visits.",
      "After some geologists visited the site, large chunks of rock were missing and the community noticed pieces for sale online, said Tommy Palliser, who manages the land with the Pituvik Landholding Corp. The Inuit community wants to work with scientists to set up a provincial park that would protect the land while allowing researchers to study it.",
      "\"There's a lot of interest for these rocks, which we understand,\" said Palliser, a member of the community. \"We just don't want any more damage.\"",

      "Liftoff came eight days later than originally planned due to high winds in the West Texas desert, but the weather met Blue Origin's safety requirements on Sunday.",
      "The hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine powering the New Shepard fired for about two-and-a-half minutes, accelerating the spacecraft to just under three times the speed of sound. The capsule then separated from the booster and continued coasting upward along its up-and-down trajectory.",
      "At that point, the passengers \u2013 Allie and Carl Kuehner, Leland Larson, Freddie Rescigno Jr., Jim Sitkin and Owolabi Salis, the first Nigerian to fly in space \u2013 began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness.",
      "Free to unstrap and float about the cabin, the passengers were able to take in the view through the largest windows in any operational spacecraft as the ship climbed to an altitude of just above 65 miles. That's about three miles higher than the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The capsule then began falling back to Earth and the passengers returned to their seats for the descent to touchdown. The reusable booster, meanwhile, made its own return to the launch site, dropping tail first to a rocket-powered touchdown.",
      "Floating under three red-and-blue parachutes, the New Shepard capsule touched down a stone's throw from the booster's concrete landing pad, closer than any previous landing. Blue Origin said that it was the result of \"low winds ... and within the safety margins of our predicted models.\"",

      "The ridges have small fractures filled with calcium sulfate, left behind by groundwater, which had not been found before in this part of Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-tall mountain Curiosity is currently climbing, NASA said.",
      "\"That's really surprising,\" said Curiosity's deputy project scientist, Abigail Fraeman. \"These calcium sulfate veins used to be everywhere, but they more or less disappeared as we climbed higher up Mount Sharp. The team is excited to figure out why they've returned now.\"",
      "Curiosity landed in the planet's Gale Crater in 2012. It has been climbing the foothills of Mount Sharp since 2014, searching for signs of environments that could have supported life, according to NASA.",

      "Retired astronaut\u00a0Peggy Whitson, America's most experienced space flier, and three rookie crewmates from India, Poland and Hungary blasted off on a\u00a0privately-financed flight\u00a0to the International Space Station early Wednesday - the fourth non-government mission mounted by Houston-based Axiom Space.",
      "Strapped into a new SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, Whitson, test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski of Poland and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu roared away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at  2:31 a.m. EDT.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 first stage propelled the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere along a northeasterly trajectory paralleling the East Coast of the United States.",
      "The booster then fell away and flew itself back to a pinpoint landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to close out its second flight, SpaceX's 467th successful recovery and its 64th in Florida.",
      "The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA trips to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit.",
      "The climb to orbit went smoothly, and the capsule was released to fly on its own about nine-and-a-half minutes after liftoff. Whitson then revealed the name of the new spacecraft: Crew Dragon Grace.",
      "\"We  had an incredible ride uphill, and now we'd like to set our course for  the International Space Station aboard the newest member of the Dragon  fleet, our spacecraft named Grace. ... Grace reminds us that spaceflight  is not just a feat of engineering,  but an act of goodwill to the  benefit of every human everywhere.\"",
      "Axiom Space provides \"private astronaut missions,\" or PAMs, to the International Space Station on a commercial basis. As the company's director of human spaceflight, Whitson, a retired astronaut with three NASA flights to her credit, is making her second flight for Axiom Space.",
      "It's not known what her crew's space agencies or governments paid for their flights, but Axiom passenger seats for space station visits typically sell for around $65 million to $70 million each. That covers the cost of nearly a year of NASA-sanctioned astronaut training, launch and a two-week stay aboard the station before returning to Earth with an ocean splashdown.",
      "The crew originally hoped to begin their mission on June 10, but the flight was held up by high winds offshore and then by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It was delayed again by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it, other than saying the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the closed-off PrK compartment to about 1.9 pounds per square inch.",
      "That presumably ensures the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station creates a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the PrK, isolating it from the rest of the station. But NASA has not confirmed the reason for the pressure change.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "If all goes well, Crew Dragon Grace will catch up with the space station after a  28-hour rendezvous, moving in for docking at the space-facing port or  the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",
      "They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.",
      "With a doctorate in biochemistry, Whitson, 65, retired from NASA in 2018 after three flights to the space station. Going into the Ax-4 flight, she had logged 675 days in space, including one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",
      "She ranks ninth in the world for cumulative time in space, No. 1 in the world among female astronauts and No. 1 overall among U.S. astronauts.",
      "As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker \u2014 seventh in the world overall \u2014 with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station.",
      "\"I think I'm somewhat addicted to space,\" she said in an interview with CBS News. \"I really like being there, and it's just exhilarating living in an environment so different than what we have here on Earth. And having adapted to that environment, it is fun for me to share my experience with the rookie flyers that are going with me.",
      "\"I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,\" she added.",
      "Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying \"we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for.\"",
      "The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three private astronaut missions.",
      "Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab.",
      "\"We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,\" Whitson said. \"The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station.",
      "\"Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well.\"",
      "All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said the mission \"opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.\"",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to the authors for comment, but did not hear back from Bartz or Wallace Johnson. Graeber declined to comment.",
      "Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots.",
      "At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.",
      "Meta also won a major victory this week after a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging the methods the company used to train its artificial intelligence technology. The case was brought by a group of well-known authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman and writer Jacqueline Woodson, who alleged Meta was \"liable for massive copyright infringement\" when it used copies of their books to train Meta's generative AI system Llama.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is debating President Trump's massive tax bill Sunday ahead of Monday's session when the chamber will effort to pass the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second term agenda.",
      "The House narrowly passed the bill last month, and Senate Republicans have since been working to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber. The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are moving quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed.",
      "The Senate has been working through the weekend as the GOP nears a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the deadline. Known as \"One Big, Beautiful Bill,\" the legislation includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Sunday that the legislation would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "Senate Republicans voted to advance the legislation late Saturday, with all but two Republicans voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts. The vote on the motion to proceed stayed open for more than three hours as holdouts sought assurances from GOP leaders and even some tweaks were made to the bill before Republicans ultimately received enough votes to move forward.",
      "Senate Democrats further delayed the legislation's path forward by forcing the bill to be read in its entirety, starting late Saturday. After nearly 16 hours, the Senate clerks concluded their reading of the bill on the floor, starting the clock on debate. Each side now has 10 hours for debate, of which Democrats are expected to use all of their time to rail against the legislation.",
      "Senate Republicans have been pursuing the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. With only a simple majority required to advance the legislation, rather than the 60-votes needed to move forward with most legislation, Senate Democrats have few mechanisms to combat the bill's progress.",
      "Following debate, the Senate is set to begin a \"vote-a-rama,\" in which senators could offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. That process was originally expected to begin in the early morning hours on Monday, but Senate leadership said late Sunday that once debate concludes, the Senate would not reconvene until 9 a.m. ET Monday. Democrats are expected to use the opportunity to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose support from three Republicans \u2014 which would still require a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. And although a number of senators who had expressed opposition to the measure ultimately decided to advance it Saturday, how they will vote on the measure in a final vote remains unclear.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Saturday that \"it's time to get this legislation across the finish line,\" adding that \"53 members will never agree on every detail of legislation.\" But he urged that Republicans are \"united in our commitment to what we're doing in this bill.\"",
      "Vance was on hand to break a possible tie vote Saturday, though his vote ultimately wasn't needed. Still, the vice president met with GOP holdouts in the majority leader's office Saturday as the White House has put pressure on lawmakers to get the bill across the finish line.",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, warned Sunday that the legislation would be a \"political albatross\" for Republicans, while suggesting that the bill could even lose support among the GOP, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\"",
      "\"I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their conviction,\" Warner said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced Sunday that he won't seek reelection in 2026, hours after President Trump threatened to back a primary challenge against him when he refused to support his massive spending and tax bill which he dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"It's not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking re-election,\" Tillis said in a statement Sunday. He noted that he hasn't \"been excited about running for another term,\" citing the choice between \"spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington\" or spending time with his family.",
      "The North Carolina Republican was first elected to the Senate in 2014, and speculation has swirled for weeks around whether he would seek another term. The announcement came hours after Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social criticizing Tillis for his opposition to some of the provisions within the massive tax legislation making its way through the Senate, while the president said he would be meeting with possible primary opponents to run against Tillis, \"looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina.\"",
      "Tillis had said earlier Sunday that he could not support the legislation, which is the centerpiece of the president's second-term agenda, due to Medicaid cuts \"that would be devastating to North Carolina.\"",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor Sunday night, Tillis said, \"Republicans are about to make a mistake on health care and betraying a promise. It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made in the Oval Office or in the Cabinet Room when I was there with Finance, where he said we can go after waste, fraud and abuse on any programs.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters after his comments, he also took issue with the way the bill is being moved forward, saying, \"If you've got to surprise or jam your conference to get something done, you're a pretty sh***y legislator.\"",
      "The senator also outlined his thoughts about Washington in recent years in his earlier statement Sunday: \"It's become increasingly evident that leaders who are willing to embrace bipartisanship, compromise, and demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an endangered species.\"",
      "In an apparent nod to former Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Tillis said \"Democrats recently lost two such leaders who were dedicated to making the Senate more of a functional and productive legislative body.\" He added that \"their presence in the Senate chamber has been sorely missed every day since\" they opted not to seek reelection.",
      "\"It underscores the greatest form of hypocrisy in American politics,\" Tillis continued. \"When people see independent thinking on the other side, they cheer. But when those very same people see independent thinking coming from their side, they scorn, ostracize, and even censure them.\"",
      "The announcement will open up a key seat in North Carolina, which has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race, with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008.",
      "National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"has won North Carolina three times, and the state's been represented by two Republican Senators for over a decade.\"",
      "\"That streak will continue in 2026 when North Carolinians elect a conservative leader committed to advancing an agenda of opportunity, prosperity, and security,\" Scott said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/d-wayne-lukas-preakness-kentucky-derby-horse-trainer-dies/",
    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 20:40:27 -0400",
    "summary": "D. Wayne Lukas, the Hall of Famer who won 15 Triple Crown races, including seven Preakness victories, has died.",
    "story": [
      "D. Wayne Lukas, the Hall of Famer who became one of the most accomplished horse trainers with seven Preakness, four Kentucky Derby and four Belmont Stakes wins, has died. He was 89.",
      "His family said Sunday in a statement to Churchill Downs, the Louisville, Kentucky, racecourse where he won his first Derby in 1988, that Lukas died Saturday night at his home.\u00a0Lukas had been hospitalized\u00a0with a severe MRSA blood infection that caused significant damage to his heart and digestive system and worsened pre-existing chronic conditions.",
      "\"Wayne devoted his life not only to horses but to the industry \u2014 developing generations of horsemen and horsewomen and growing the game by inviting unsuspecting fans into the winner's circle,\" his family said in the statement. \"Whether he was boasting about a maiden 2-year-old as the next Kentucky Derby winner or offering quiet words of advice before a big race, Wayne brought heart, grace, and grit to every corner of the sport. His final days were spent at home in Kentucky, where he chose peace, family, and faith.\"",
      "Lukas won 15 Triple Crown races, including the Kentucky Derby four times. Only good friend Bob Baffert has more Triple Crown victories, and Lukas owns a record-tying 20 in the Breeders' Cup World Championships.",
      "\"The whole secret of this game, I think, is being able to read the horse: Read what he needs, what he doesn't need, what he can't do, what he can do,\" Lukas said in May before his 34th and final Preakness Stakes. \"That's the whole key. Everybody's got the blacksmith, everybody's got to the same bed available, the feed man. We all can hire a good jockey. We all can hire a pretty good exercise rider if we've got the means, so what the hell is the difference? The horse is the difference and what we do with him in reading him.\"",
      "No one in the race's 149-year history has saddled more horses in the Preakness than Lukas, with 48 since debuting in 1980. He told CBS Baltimore in 2013 that he thought he had a knack for identifying horses with talent.",
      "\"Of the six horses I bought last year, three are in the Preakness,\" he said. \"So I'm pretty proud of that, after looking at 3,000.\"",
      "Retired jockey Donna Brothers, now an NBC Sports analyst, once called Lukas \"a magician\" for his ability to evolve a horse's potential. \"He's been doing it for a number of years, and he can continue to produce those sorts of results,\" Brothers said in 2022.",
      "Lukas was affectionately known around the barns and the racetrack as \"Coach\" because he coached high school basketball before his professional career with horses began. Even with months to go before his 90th birthday, he would get up on his pony in the early morning hours and go out to the track himself, rather than letting his assistants do the day-to-day work.",
      "Born Darnell Wayne Lukas on Sept. 2, 1935, in Wisconsin as the second of three children, he rose to prominence in the sport with quarter horses in races that are effectively sprints. He moved into thoroughbreds in the late 1970s and won his first Preakness with Codex in 1980.",
      "Lukas has 4,967 documented victories in thoroughbred racing, with his horses earning more than $310 million from more than 30,600 starts.",
      "\"Today we lost one of the great champions of Churchill Downs and one of the most significant figures in Thoroughbred racing over the last 50 years,\" Churchill Downs Inc. CEO Bill Carstanjen said. \"We will miss his humor, his wisdom and his unmatched capacity to thrill the fans with the performances of his horses on our sport's biggest days.\"",
      "Achieving something of a career renaissance over the past decade, one he credits to finding the right owners willing to spend money on horses, Lukas won the Preakness last year with Seize the Grey. Asked what motivates him to keep doing his job well into his late 80s, he gave a pep talk fit for a locker room before a big game.",
      "\"If you have a passion, you eliminate all the excuses,\" Lukas said. \"That's how it works. You get up early. You go without a meal. You drive. You go without sleep - as long as you got the passion. Don't let that sofa pull you down. It's a little easy when that alarm goes off to say, 'Oh my God, I don't know if I really want to do this today.' Erase that. The most important decision you'll ever make in your life is your attitude decision. Make it early, and make the right one.\"",

    "summary": "FBI crime reports reviewed by CBS News show assaults or attacks against people at churches, synagogues, temples and mosques surged nearly 100% between 2021 and 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Alan Hausman paused mid-sentence during the phone call, then said he is still dogged by \"survivor's remorse.\"",
      "Hausman said he can clearly remember trying to drive up a road to get to the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh after he was alerted to a shooting. But the road was impassable. The memories of the aftermath are indelible.",
      "\"Every time I see another attack, it's like someone picked the scab off of my wound,\" said Hausman, who is the president of the synagogue's board of directors. He was not attending the synagogue on the day of the October 2018 shooting spree that killed 11 people.",
      "The massacre resulted in 63 counts including hate crime charges, resulting in the\u00a0conviction and a death sentence against the gunman.",
      "Hausman, who is an emergency management official in Pittsburgh, said the Tree of Life now has armed security, as do other religious institutions and organizations in the city and region. The houses of worship have installed new alarm systems, and have roving security guards in parking lots, to deter future threats, he said.",
      "According to FBI data and Justice Department officials who spoke with CBS News, the Tree of Life tragedy didn't slow the targeting of religious institutions, but was an early warning of the recent wave of planned attacks.",
      "FBI crime reports reviewed by CBS News show assaults or attacks against people at churches, synagogues, temples and mosques surged nearly 100% between 2021 and 2023.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon referenced a growing stack on her desk of criminal cases that allege the targeting of religious centers.",
      "\"I think it's a form of terrorism, because attacks on churches are meant to terrorize people,\" Dhillon said. \"And they're meant to deter people from going there. And so it makes everyone feel unsafe.\"",
      "On June 18, Justice Department prosecutors secured a 25-year prison term in the case of Rui Zhang of Virginia. Zhang was convicted of targeting a Haymarket, Virginia, church for an attack. Prosecutors alleged Zhang had written a manifesto, and that he was inside a Sunday service at the church with a semiautomatic handgun, two magazines of ammunition, and two knives. He allegedly had additional ammunition, knives, and a canister of bear spray in his nearby car.",
      "In April, the Justice Department also secured a conviction of an Arizona man of targeting a series of churches. According to investigators, Zimnako Saleh \"traveled to four Christian churches in Arizona, California, and Colorado, wearing black backpacks. At two of those churches, Salah planted those backpacks, placing congregants in fear that they contained bombs.",
      "At the other two churches, Salah was confronted by security before he got the chance to plant those backpacks. Photos of backpacks and movements from the day of the attempted attack inside the churches were included in charging documents.",
      "Dhillon said civil rights investigators have marshalled a more focused effort to combat the targeting of houses of worship.",
      "\"We want to shut that threat down by making sure that no one is feeling like churches, houses of worship, people of faith are soft targets in the United States,\" Dhillon said. \"That is why it's a priority.\"",
      "The increasing wave of threats against religious centers is \u2013 at least partly \u2013 driven by emerging white nationalism or the targeting of minority groups or churches that are welcoming to LGBTQ communities, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a liberal-leaning nonprofit organization which focuses on civil rights issues and combating hate crimes.",
      "\"About one in 10 of the attacks that we documented in the first six months of 2024 were also focused on 'welcoming' religious communities,\" said R.G. Cravens, an SPLC researcher.",
      "\"We have seen an uptick in synagogues being targeted for similar things like vandalism, graffiti and harassment\u00a0 since the October 7th (attacks) in Israel,\" Cravens added. \"And those come in a lot of forms that often do indicate the hard right white nationalist and white supremacist groups are involved.\"",
      "Dhillon directed CBS News to several other recent cases under investigation by the Justice Department. In February, Kevin Colantonio, 36, of Rhode Island pleaded guilty to a federal criminal charge for setting multiple fires around the exterior of a predominantly black church in North Providence.",
      "The federal criminal cases yield the possibility of lengthy prison terms. Zhang's prison term runs through the year 2050.",
      "Dhillon said the Justice Department's new leadership has an urgency in tackling these cases, pointing to hate crime charges filed against a man who allegedly used Molotov cocktails to attack peaceful marchers in Boulder, Colorado, on June 1.",
      "\"We were all over it. And we filed what has been described to me as the fastest hate crime criminal complaint in recent history,\" Dhillon said. \"It is important for the community being targeted to feel and see that the United States is taking these crimes with the utmost seriousness.\"",
      "The Justice Department is preparing for an August court hearing in the case of Elias Rodriguez, who is accused of targeting and murdering two Israeli embassy officials in Washington, D.C. last month.",
      "Rodriguez allegedly shot and killed the victims \u2014 a couple about to become engaged, according to Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the U.S. \u2014 as they were leaving the museum, which is located in the heart of the U.S. capital. According to police and video from the scene, he shouted \"free, free Palestine\" as he was being taken into custody.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Justice Department announced that the case was being investigated as a potential hate crime.\u00a0 Rodriguez is being held in pretrial detention.",

      "\"This is the most outrageous action, I think, this crowd has taken on education,\" Warner told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"We have great public universities in Virginia. We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the Governor. Jim Ryan had done a very good job; just completed a major capital campaign.\"",

They are doing damage to our flagship university. And if they can do it here, they'll do it elsewhere.\"",
      "In his resignation letter, Ryan warned of the potential risks of resisting the administration's demands.\u00a0 \"Hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld,\" Ryan wrote.",
      "His resignation came amid an investigation that targeted DEI efforts across multiple universities, with UVA's president coming under intense scrutiny from the Department of Education and Department of Justice, according to CBS News reporting.",
      "Warner acknowledged the difficult choice Ryan faced.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I understand that, with so many things at stake, that the idea, and I think Jim Ryan laid it out, that he was going to make his personal job more important than these cuts. But, boy, that shouldn't have been the choice.\"",

      "Most prominent among the Ivy League schools targeted by the Trump administration has been Harvard University.\u00a0 In June, the Trump administration moved to block new international students from enrolling at Harvard, accusing the university of failing to report disciplinary records and calling it \"no longer a trustworthy steward\" of international programs. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order and later extended it, describing the administration's actions as\u00a0 unconstitutional retaliation.",
      "The administration also revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, froze research funding, and pressed the university on DEI policies and campus protests. Harvard has sued, calling the actions politically motivated and a threat to academic freedom.",

      "\"Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history \u2013 and I'll always remember her as a close friend, a mentor, and the most talented legislator I've ever known,\" Walz said in his eulogy. \"For seven years, I've had the privilege of signing her bills into law. And I know that millions of Minnesotans will get to live better lives because she and Mark chose public service.\"",
      "Melissa Hortman was remembered for her leadership, sense of humor and strong commitment to doing good work to improve the lives of Minnesotans.",

Let's do it because of the way they lived, and the way they led. With joy and passion. With respect and empathy. With purpose and humility.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, we will take a look at that surprising string of foreign policy successes last week with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia's Mark Warner and Texas House Republican Michael McCaul.",
      "Then: What's next when it comes to Iran? We will talk with the head of the IAEA, the watchdog agency who monitors nuclear capabilities in Iran, Rafael Grossi, and speak to Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani.",
      "Finally, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb will join us for a reality check on new developments with vaccines and health policy.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Last night, the president's Big Beautiful Bill passed a key procedural vote in the Senate, but efforts to make the legislation palatable to enough Republicans to secure final passage continue, as you can see.",
      "Overnight, there are new complications. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the Senate bill would cost almost a trillion dollars more than the House bill. That's a preliminary estimate. But if the bill passes the Senate as it currently exists, that could jeopardize the fragile support among fiscal conservatives in the House.",
      "We begin today with Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. He is the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Good morning.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been probably sleep-deprived with all of what is happening.",
      "But I want to ask you about what's going on, on Capitol Hill. Republicans are going to pass this along party lines. It's expected, right? But it includes things in here that Democrats, including you, had supported, right, the no taxes on tips provision, more money for Border Patrol, expansion of the childcare tax credit upwards of $2,000.",
      "Why vote against it when there are popular provisions within it? And doesn't that just allow the president to say, oh, you want to raise taxes?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Margaret, you can put as much lipstick on this pig as you want.",
      "This will be a political albatross for the Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Because it takes 16 million Americans off of health care coverage with cuts to Medicaid and cuts to the Obamacare marketplace.",
      "That will move us as a nation back to the same percentage of uninsured we had before Obamacare. And it's not like these people are not going to get sick. They're going to show up at the emergency room. Rural hospitals are going to shut down. That has been evidenced across the nation.",
      "It also goes after food assistance. Do we \u2013 are we really in such a place that we're cutting, in my state, a couple hundred thousand people off of school lunches, school breakfasts? They even cut food banks. It's cruel. They have also ended up, at the end of the day, cutting 20,000-plus clean energy jobs.",
      "And for what? This was to make sure that the highest, most wealthy Americans can get an extra tax break. And, as you just saw on your Chyron there, it adds $4.5 trillion to the debt. I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this. And we will see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their convictions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of the Republicans are arguing, well, we have to deal with these entitlements, and the work requirements and things that may lead to some of the lack of qualifications you talk about, they're not that burdensome. It's volunteer work or part-time work. So are you overstating it?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No, it's 16 million Americans off of health care.",
      "Medicaid cuts, they're \u2013 these numbers, they're not my numbers. They're all independent sources. And what \u2013 the thing that I don't think people have realized, people say, well, I'm Medicaid, I'm not poor, I maybe buying my health insurance through the marketplace. Your rates will go up $800 or $900 a month.",
      "And that will trickle through the whole rest of the health care market, because, if you suddenly take people out of the system, they show up at the emergency room in uncompensated care, the only way those costs get passed on is higher health insurance to all of us who have traditional coverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if this is so against their own interests, why haven't you been able to peel more Republicans away?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I think we will see. Even as recently as just an hour ago, some of the special Medicaid provisions for certain states, I think, were disallowed because of the so-called Byrd rule.",
      "And it's not over until it's over. I will give you \u2013 I will grant that President Trump has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner. At the other end, this bill will come back and bite them. This is going to do so much damage in terms of not only health care, food assistance, the whole notion that we are moving towards cleaner and energy jobs, all on the chopping block, adding $4 trillion into the debt.",
      "Tell me\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 at the end of the day how that is good for America. I don't think you can make the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Education is another front in this fight with the president. And I want to ask you about what's happening in Virginia.",
      "We saw the University of Virginia's president, James Ryan, resign on Friday. This was extraordinary. This was a pressure campaign from the Trump administration over diversity or so-called DEI programs.",
      "In a letter, and I want to read this, Ryan wrote that, if he had tried to fight back, \"Hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld.\"",
      "But he resigned to avoid this. Is that now the playbook for other university presidents, walk away, don't have the fight?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: This is the most outrageous action I think this crowd has taken on education. We have great public universities in Virginia. We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the governor.",
      "Jim Ryan had done a very good job, just completed a major capital campaign. For him to be threatened \u2013 and, literally, there was indication that they received the letter that, if he didn't resign on a day last week by 5:00, all these cuts would have taken place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was that explicit?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: It was that explicit. This is extortion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that sounds personal. That doesn't sound specific to policy or changes.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Like, how does the next university president get in line and get the money?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: You're shocked that is coming \u2013 personal attacks are coming out of this administration?",
      "This is \u2013 I thought the Republicans were about states' rights. I thought the Republicans were about let's transfer more power to the states. This federal DOE and Department of Justice should get their nose out of University of Virginia. They are doing damage to our flagship university.",
      "And if they can do it here, they will do it elsewhere. At the end of the day, I understand that, with so many things at stake, that the idea \u2013 and I think Jim Ryan laid it out \u2013 that he was willing to make his personal job more important than these cuts, but, boy, oh, boy, that shouldn't have been the choice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and we know that the university \u2013 that the administration is looking at more universities and the assistant A.G., Harmeet Dhillon, indicated that publicly, and University of California next in the crosshairs. So we're going to be watching that carefully.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: They all to make them like Harvard. They want to take on public universities the way they have now taken on the Ivies.",
      "End of the day, this is going to hurt our universities, chase away world- class talent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And, frankly, if we don't have some level of academic freedom, then what kind of country are we?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your oversight role on Intelligence.",
      "You were briefed on what's going on with Iran. You said you fear the American people are being given a false sense of comfort with these declarations of mission accomplished. Do you believe U.S. intelligence knows how much of a capability Iran maintains now?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I don't think we have final assessments.",
      "Let me \u2013 first of all\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 we don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Secondly, the military performed an extraordinary mission. And I think they effected a great deal of damage to Iran's facilities.",
      "But the idea that the president of the United States with no data two hours after the strike is suddenly hitting the standard of saying total obliteration, that leads us to think that they are out of the game. And it \u2013 we don't know that yet.",
      "And let's just be clear. You can actually set back the major program where they were trying to create potentially \u2013 and there had been no decision made by the ayatollah to actually move towards weaponization, but where they could have a weaponized system with a dozen-plus missiles that are nuclear \u2013 nuclear-armed.",
      "But what they don't know is, they didn't \u2013 and this was appropriate. I don't \u2013 I'm not criticizing administration. They didn't go after the enriched uranium that was Isfahan, at that base, because it's buried so deeply. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They just hit it with Tomahawks, not the bunker-busters.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: So, the fact that they can have still enriched uranium, they may have some ability to still cascade that means they could still move forward on something that might be not delivered by a missile, but a bomb in a trunk of a car.",
      "And all I don't want is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 the American people or, for that matter, our allies in the region to rely on a term that was set by the president before he had any facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Point taken there on the specifics of the rudimentary bomb.",
      "But coming back to what you just said, there had been no decision by the supreme leader to make a weapon. Secretary of State Rubio on this program last Sunday told me it was irrelevant, the answer to that question, because Iran had everything it needed to make and build a weapon.",
      "So, based on what you know, was there an emergency? Was there a reason the U.S. had to act in the moment it did?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: We were on the verge of what could have been a much greater war in terms of Iran and Israel spreading to the whole region.",
      "Was there the imminent emergency that would trigger \u2013 because lots of presidents have looked at taking this action. I think that's very debatable. If, at the end of the day, we end up where this peace holds and Iran doesn't strike back, hallelujah.",
      "But what we don't know, for example, is Iran going to try to hit us on cyber, with this administration cutting literally half of our cybersecurity personnel in this country? So do \u2013 I just want to make sure that we do this in a measured way. The military did great. We have set them back.",
      "But let's not pretend that they don't have any capabilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And the only way we can get resolution on that Margaret \u2013 and Secretary Rubio acknowledged this in the brief \u2013 is if we have boots on the ground with inspectors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: That means we have got to go to diplomacy.",
      "If America and Iran start negotiating this week face-to-face\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 that would be good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we were \u2013 we will talk to the man who directs those boots on the grounds potentially, the inspectors, later on in the program from the IAEA.",
      "Thank you very much, Senator.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to leave it there.",
      "We will be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Texas Republican Congressman Michael McCaul.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-Texas): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your Republican colleagues in the Senate have been working hard on trying to get this bill together, and they're probably going to eke it past.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's even with GOP lawmakers like Thom Tillis saying they can't stomach what this is going to do to Medicaid, an estimated $930 billion in cuts to it.",
      "That's more significant than what you all had voted to do in the House. Are you going to vote again for final passage if it looks like this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: No, I'm going to vote for it for this reason.",
      "I think these numbers, it's all about waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid. What I'm voting for is a border security measure, $80 billion, $12 billion to reimburse states like mine. I'm voting for $150 billion that will go to our Department of Defense at a time when we saw, with Iran, it is desperately needed.",
      "The world is on fire, Eastern Europe, Indo-Pacific. And then the tax cuts. I mean, if we don't extend these tax cuts, it'll be the largest tax increase in American history. For those three reasons, I'm a yes. I think everyone in the House, they know the peril they're in if they vote no on this thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean the peril they're in?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I think, first of all, it's good for the nation.",
      "Secondly, they know that their \u2013 their jobs are at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president will come after them.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Not just from the president, but from the voting \u2013 the American people.",
      "Our base back home will not reelect us to office if we vote no on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it about reelection, or is it about the policies, right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: No. It's about \u2013 it's about what's \u2013 no, it's great for the country, and I have outlined the three top points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But help me understand, then. You have such narrow margins in the House.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you look at these projections from, like, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. They say it violates the House instructions by $500 billion or more, what the Senate just put together here, and that deficits could rise more than $3 trillion.",
      "How do you get that through when you have fellow conservatives who are fiscal hawks and saying, I can't get with this, like Chip Roy?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Not to get into the weeds on the economics, but the dynamic scoring is not taken into account here by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "That means that, when you cut taxes, you actually get increased revenues to the Treasury. And that's something we saw under President Kennedy, under President Reagan, and under President Bush.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chip Roy and some of these other fiscal conservatives are going to come along for the ride?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I think \u2013 at the end of the day, I think they're going to vote for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do.",
      "Let's talk about some of the threats that you mentioned there at home and abroad. You've been briefed on the actions against Iran. The IAEA director told us here that Iran has capabilities and could be up and running within a matter of months.",
      "Do you think it is an overstatement by the White House or a mistake to declare mission accomplished?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, first of all, I respect the IAEA. Their job is to inspect, not to be an intelligence agency, so they don't really have the clear intelligence analysis that I would attribute to our intelligence community like the CIA.",
      "We met with Director Ratcliffe. It was not just his decision. These are career and intelligence officers that have been at the CIA for over 30 years that made this assessment that it was severely damaged and sets the program back a matter of years.",
      "In any event, the world and the Middle East is safer today than it was seven days ago, a week ago. That is highlighted by the fact that the proxies didn't light up. Russia didn't come to their \u2013 to their aid. China basically ran back for cover. Iran is on its own and psychologically is very damaged. The deterrence is real. The damage is real.",
      "This was a masterful military operation, the likes of which I haven't seen since my father's war, World War II.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the homeland front, do you then dismiss these concerns about threats? You have the National Terrorism Advisory System that says there's a heightened threat environment in the U.S. after the strikes.",
      "There were federal agents that arrested 11 foreign nationals from Iran, including one who had ties to Hezbollah. Have you seen specific evidence of any kind of threat here in the United States, or is it, as you say, just done and over with?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: No, I have.",
      "We picked up 11 Iranians, one a sniper, one IRGC, another one a known suspected terrorist, just within the last couple of days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But were they planning to do anything, or did they just happen to have those alliances from the past?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: You know, I don't know all the details, but I will tell you, the FBI briefed me in a defensive briefing after Soleimani was killed. I was a part of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2020.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: That I was under indictment in Iran and that I was on that top target list.",
      "So, you know, look \u2013 and is it imminent? I don't know. We have to take it seriously that there could be sleeper cells in the United States that could go after people like Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, you know \u2013 you know, myself and others that were involved in that decision-making, and including the president of the United States. We know he's been targeted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to detention of migrants here in the United States, it's a high, 59,000 detainees, according to ICE; 47 percent of them, though, lack a criminal record. Fewer than 30 percent have been convicted of crimes.",
      "Doesn't that show that the numbers, these aren't the worst of the worst?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes, I was a federal prosecutor for many years, counterterrorism. You have to prioritize, right? I would prioritize the aggravated felons that Mayorkas let in, in defiance of federal law.",
      "It was shall detain. He said may detain and let them out into the streets. I would \u2013 I would prioritize that first.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you would prefer that Homeland Security prioritize them, and not run up the numbers the way they are in this\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I think they're running the numbers up because 15 to 20 million people came under the \u2013 under the Biden administration, and they're trying to get some sanity involved in the United States.",
      "And I think deterrence is the key here. And, Margaret, it is working. You know, the apprehension rate at the border \u2013 and Texas is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 the biggest one \u2013 has gone down to almost zero.",
      "I mean, the border is just about secure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Catch and release is over, and the threats are going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike McCaul, Congressman, thank you very much for your insights today.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Thanks, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be back with more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look now at some of the changes to America's public health policies under the Trump administration, we're joined by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on the board at Pfizer and is now the chairman of the board at Illumina.",
      "Good morning. Good to see you.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Dr. Gottlieb, you worked in the first Trump administration. This second Trump administration seems very different in its approach to public health on a lot of fronts. One of them was really laid bare this week with this newly remade Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.",
      "Secretary Kennedy had dismissed about 17 members of the existing board and put in some members of his own choice. And, in a video, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said federal immunization policy is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"no longer a credible process\" and it's being politicized at the expense of children.",
      "That's a pretty stunning statement. Do you agree with the Academy of Pediatrics?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, you're right. I worked in the first Trump administration. I was fortunate to do that and proud to serve in that administration. I think we did a lot of important things on public health. We presided over the first cell and gene therapy approvals.",
      "The president tried to expand access to those treatments through the right to try legislation that he championed. He supported the FDA on an effort to try to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids, record number of generic approvals, and a lot of other accomplishments.",
      "I think a lot of people on my side of the political aisle feel that a lot of these policies that Secretary Kennedy is championing are \u2013 are going to be contained to vaccines and not bleed into a broader public health doctrine.",
      "I think that's not right. I think there's a lot of people now who don't think these things are particularly political, or shouldn't be, and don't think these decisions should be politically decided who are going to find, when they go to the doctor's office, that vaccines that they may want to protect their lives or the lives of their families aren't going to be available.",
      "This does look like a political process right now. The secretary is going after issues that have long been bugaboos of him and his anti-vax group, Children's Health Defense. I don't think that's unmistakable \u2013 mistakable at this point. And I think that he would probably acknowledge that, that he's taking on issues that he's championed for the last 20 years to restrict access to certain vaccines.",
      "That's going to grow. The list is growing, and it's going to start to be very tangible for people, and go well beyond just the COVID vaccine, which is, I think, what most people think about when they perceive this administration's or the secretary's efforts to try to restrict access to vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the specific things from this meeting was advice to avoid flu vaccines containing an ingredient called thimerosal.",
      "Right around the same time as the meeting, the CDC removed information from its website that debunked claims that this ingredient was linked to autism. Secretary Kennedy says it's \u2013 it's journalists who are obscuring the truth.",
      "What do people need to know about the flu vaccine and this ingredient?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, so this is an old ingredient. It's a preservative used in multidose vials of flu vaccine primarily. Only a very small percentage of flu vaccine vials still contain it.",
      "What it is, is an ingredient that's added to multidose vials, because those vials, you're going to go in and out of with different needles as you administer the vaccine to different patients. So they're not single dose injections. They're multidose vials that \u2013 primarily used in some busy clinics, almost exclusively in adults right now.",
      "Back in the early 2000s, I was at FDA when we reformulated the vaccine, so we compelled manufacturers to reformulate the vaccines to take this preservative out, not because we thought it was unsafe, but because there was a lot of consternation among anti-vax groups that they thought that there was a link between this ingredient and autism.",
      "The ingredient does contain small amounts of ethylmercury, not methylmercury, ethylmercury, which is the same kind of mercury found in fish, in very small \u2013 very small amounts. And so we compelled the manufacturers to reformulate the vast majority of vaccines. Still, 4 percent of flu vaccines that get administered, mostly to adults, are from these multidose vials.",
      "And this has long been a bugaboo of the secretary and his group, the Children's Health Defense Fund. In fact, the only presentation at the ACIP meeting was from the head of that group. And you're right that there was a countering analysis from the CDC officials asserting that there's no link between thimerosal and autism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That \u2013 that analysis was taken down from the website. The secretary put out a statement that said that it wasn't \u2013 it didn't go through proper review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, Dr. Gottlieb, and talk more with you on the other side of this. These are complicated issues I want to dig into with you.",
      "So we hope all of you will stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb.",
      "Dr. Gottlieb, just to pick back up, we were talking about the meeting that took place this past week with the newly reconstituted advisory committee on immunization. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, you know him, he's a doctor, he has oversight and chairs the Health Committee, he called for the meeting to be canceled because he said there's no CDC director in place, and when it comes to these appointees, he said, \"many of them do not have significant experience studying microbiology, epidemiology, or immunology.\" And they may have preconceived bias against mRNA vaccines.",
      "It's \u2013 I'm not a doctor, but it seems to me that experience in immunology would be important if you're advising on immunizations. His counsel was ignored here. Is there any check on Secretary Kennedy at this point? Is there a need to get a CDC director in place quickly?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D., (Former FBA Commissioner): Yes, well, the CDC director had a confirmation hearing this week, and hopefully she'll be in place soon. I think he's quite strong and a good pick for that job.",
      "The board, this ACIP board, isn't fully constituted. There's only seven members on the board. At its peak membership it has about 15. And you're right, a lot of the people who have been appointed don't have deep experience or any experience, quite frankly, in vaccine science. They are people who have been ideologically aligned with Secretary Kennedy in the past and worked with him, many of them, not all of them. And I think that that isn't something that even the secretary would probably dispute at this time.",
      "And it did lead to some awkward moments at that meeting. For example, you know, one member had to have explained to him the difference between an antibody prophylaxis and a vaccine. So, there were evidence in that discussion where the CDC directors had to provide some, quite frankly, remedial assistance to help brief these members on the basis of vaccine science. So, it did show.",
      "Hopefully, once they fully constitute that board, you're going to get more balance on it. I think some people are skeptical. I remain hopeful that there will be some good members that get seated eventually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, one of the things about the American health system is that question of continued innovation. Earlier this month, the FDA approved a twice-yearly injection of an HIV prevention drug called Lenacapavir. How significant is an innovation like that. And given the environment you're talking about, will these new advisers get in the way of being able to get those kind of things to market?",

It's a long-acting antiviral that provides six months of protection against HIV and was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection in a population that was high risk of contracting HIV. So, it was a change in the formulation of an antiviral that allows it to be administered just twice a year and provides sustained exposure to the benefits of that antiviral.",
      "We're seeing a lot of innovation like this. There was also news this week from a small biotech company that I don't have any involvement with that they had developed a pill that could provide sustained protection against flu. So, it's an antiviral, but it is formulated in a way where it could be administered once ahead of flu season to provide protection across the entire season, and also look to be very effective. So, we're seeing a lot of innovations like this.",
      "What I'm worried about is innovation in vaccine science. I work on the venture capital side, where we make investments in \u2013 in new companies. And there has been a pullback of biotech start-ups that have been looking to develop new vaccines. For example, vaccines for Epstein-Barr virus, which we know is linked to certain \"b\"-cell lymphomas and maybe is linked to multiple sclerosis. That \u2013 that's a new area of science, the potential to vaccinate children against that, much like we vaccinate kids against HPV right now and prevent cervical cancer and other types of cancers. Maybe in the future we may be vaccinating for EBV. But there's been a lot of pullback to that kind of investment. And so I think we're going to see less innovation in vaccine science as a result of the environment we're in.",

Another issue that Secretary Kennedy has championed over his career, this perceived \u2013 this perception that there's a link between fluoride in water and some neurotoxic effects of that. That's been studied thoroughly. It's been, I think, fully debunked. There's very small amounts of fluoride in water.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even the Iranians concede that the damage to three of their nuclear sites from last week's bombing was excessive and serious, but it's a mystery as to what the Iranian nuclear capability is now. Friday, we spoke with the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, and we asked him just that.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI (IAEA Director General): It's clear that what happened in particular in \u2013 in Fordow, in Natanz, Isfahan, where Iran used to have and still has to some degree capabilities in terms of treatment, conversion, and enrichment of uranium have been destroyed to an important degree. Some is still standing. So, there is, of course, an important setback in terms of those \u2013 of those capabilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was roughly 400 kilograms, which is just under 900 pounds, of highly enriched uranium before the attacks.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know these are in small canisters and relatively easy to move. Do you have any idea where that was moved and if it was moved before the attack?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: We presume, and I think it's \u2013 it's logical to presume, that when they announced that they are going to be taking protective measures, this could be part of it. But as I said, we don't know where this material could be, or if part of it could have been, you know, under the attack during those 12 days. So, some could have been destroyed as part of the attack, but some could have been moved.",
      "So, there has to be, at some point, a clarification. If we don't get that clarification, this will continue to be hanging, you know, over our heads as \u2013 as a potential problem. So, this is why I say, it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If we don't know where the highly enriched uranium is, and cannot account for all the centrifuges, is there still a risk that they could rushing towards a bomb?",

But we need to be in a position to assert and to confirm what is there and \u2013 and where is it and \u2013 and \u2013 and what happened.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So, you cannot dis-invent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So, I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations are not \u2013 you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily.",

But our inspection work was \u2013 was constant. In particular, in this sensitive area of the number of centrifuges and the amount of material, we had perfect view. We didn't have view on other things that we wanted to have. But on this one, it was \u2013 it was complete. It was comprehensive. And \u2013 and, of course, at the moment, there is \u2013 there is nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran wasn't keeping its stockpile of enriched uranium secret. What do you think it was intended for? And did you see anything that suggested that they were looking to weaponize?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: They have all of these capabilities, but for the agency they \u2013 first of all, they didn't have nuclear weapons, OK? This needs to be said. The IAEA does not judge intentions. The IAEA looks at the activities of a country and reports it to the world. So, it is countries that \u2013 that say, well, this is of concern on a (ph).",
      "What we were concerning \u2013 what I was concerned about is that there were other things that were not clear. For example, we have found traces of uranium in \u2013 in \u2013 in some places in Iran which were not the normal, declared facilities. And we were asking for years, why did we find these traces of enriched uranium in place \"x,\" \"y,\" or zed (ph). And we were simply not getting credible answers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",

      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Iranians are pointing to it now. And the foreign minister seems to be sort of blaming you for the military strikes. He said, it wasn't honest and fair, your report. What do you make of those criticisms?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: The IAEA, as always, has had a very honest assessment of the situation. And there were many, I can assure you, there were many that they \u2013 that we're seeing (ph) in your report, you must say that they have nuclear weapons, or they are very close to have nuclear weapons. And we didn't. We simply didn't because this was not what we were seeing, all right, so \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you also said you couldn't verify that it was a peaceful program.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Absolutely, because we have to say everything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: People here are looking for clarity, and there's confusion in the United States.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS is reporting that the Defense Intelligence Agency assesses Iran's program was set back a few months. But once they dig out, they could resume in a number of months. They have to rebuild electrical and water supplies. The CIA and the national intelligence director say the facilities were destroyed, and it would take years to rebuild. Israel says the military program is set back many years.",
      "What's the truth here? What do you make of these assessments?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: All of that depends on your metrics, Margaret. If you tell me it will take them two months or three months, for what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium. Or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there. It is clear that there have been severe damage, but is not total damage, first of all.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio released a statement yesterday saying that there were calls in Iran \u2013 this, I believe, is from a newspaper that the supreme leader oversees, accusing our prior guest, Raphael Grossi, of being an Israeli spy and calling for his arrest and execution. To be clear, is Iran threatening U.N. inspectors?",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: No, there is not any threat. It is a very clear law of our parliament that they have suspended our cooperation with IAEA because the agency has not implemented their rights, their responsibility. Due to this, it is conditional law. And as long as this condition has not been set, so are the cooperation with IAEA will be suspended.",
      "But wherever it's set up as according to the law, so we can have \u2013 resume our cooperation. But there is not any threat against the general director of IAEA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was published in Israel \u2013 in Iran's Kayhan newspaper. Your foreign minister did also say that the IAEA and Grossi himself are malign in intent. Are the IAEA personnel, are the inspectors already inside Iran safe and can they go back to their work of inspecting your sites?",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: Exactly. They are in Iran. They are in the safe conditions. But activity has been suspended. They cannot have access to our site. But maybe some one individual opinion of the people that may criticize the IAEA or threat the general director. But we criticize IAEA. We \u2013 our assessment is that they have not done their jobs, so they failed and they prepared and pay great (ph) for such aggravation against us.",

So, we are in the negotiation, we are ready for the negotiation. But after this aggression, it is not proper condition for a new round of the negotiation. And there is no request for negotiation and meeting with the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the United States is wanting to meet with Iran to talk. And while the supreme leader issued a statement saying Iran had dealt the U.S. a slap in the face, after that, President Trump said he had actually stopped Israel from going further and had stopped Israel from an attempt to kill your supreme leader. Why not take the offer of a diplomatic lifeline? Because he seems to be offering one.",

They have impunity from any attacks. So, we should understand that what is the principle and condition for any negotiation. Negotiation is \u2013 has its \u2013 the principles, and it is a give and take process. So we should engage in the negotiation and discuss with this order (ph) maybe we reach to a conclusion or not.

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 13:10:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Mark Warner suggested that the bill, which is nearing a final vote in the Senate, could lose support from Republicans, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said Sunday that President Trump's tax bill that's nearing a final vote in the Senate will be a \"political albatross\" for Republicans, citing the cuts to social safety nets and its projected effect on the national debt.",
      "\"I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their conviction,\" Warner said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Senate is working through the weekend as the GOP makes a push to pass the legislation, known as the \"big, beautiful bill,\" ahead of a July 4 deadline to get the bill to the president's desk. The House narrowly approved the bill last month, but the Senate has been putting its imprint on the massive package that extends Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts and would fund border security, defense and energy production priorities, costs which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the legislation  would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "In addition to the increase to the national debt, Warner criticized the bill for the toll he warned it would take on rural hospitals, access to health insurance, food assistance and clean energy jobs.",
      "The Senate is expected to begin a marathon overnight session Sunday as the bill nears final passage. It would then return to the House for signoff on the upper chamber's changes, before it can go to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "Senate Republicans are working to pass the legislation under the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. The process means Senate Democrats have few mechanisms to combat the bill, which they largely oppose, apart from delaying a vote. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer forced the bill to be read on the floor in its entirety late Saturday, which has pushed back debate on the bill by more than 12 hours.",
      "When asked why Democrats are expected to widely oppose the bill when there are provisions within it that they may see as favorable, such as an expansion of the Child Tax Credit and a provision limiting taxes on tips, Warner said \"you can put as much lipstick on this pig as you want.\"",
      "The Virginia Democrat suggested that the bill could even lose support from Republicans, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\" He added that while Mr. Trump \"has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner,\" the bill \"will come back and bite them.\"",
      "All but two Republicans voted to advance the measure Saturday in a key test vote. But the GOP win came after hours of hand-wringing over whether a handful of Republicans would prevent the legislation from moving forward. The vote remained open for more than three hours Saturday night as holdouts met with Senate GOP leaders to seek assurances on the bill. And Vice President JD Vance was on hand to break a possible tie vote, though his vote ultimately wasn't needed. He joined a meeting with GOP holdouts in the majority leader's office Saturday night.",
      "Vance's presence at the Capitol came as the White House put pressure on Republicans in Congress to get the legislation to the president's desk. In a Truth Social post Saturday night, Mr. Trump indicated he would work to support primary challenges to one of the bill's opponents, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who is up for reelection in 2026.",
      "GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" said Republicans in the House \"know their jobs are at risk\" if they oppose the measure, citing pressure from the president and the American people themselves. He said \"our base back home will not reelect us to office if we vote no on this.\"",
      "\"Everyone in the House, they know the peril they're in if they vote no on this thing,\" McCaul said.",
      "The Texas Republicans said he plans to support the measure when it returns to the House due to its funding for border security and defense, along with the tax cut extensions. And he predicted that it will see support even among fiscal hawks who have expressed opposition to the legislation.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think they're going to vote for it,\" McCaul said.",

      "Blue Origin launched six astrotourists to the edge of space and back Sunday, a 10-minute ride marking the Jeff Bezos-owned company's 13th passenger flight out of the discernible atmosphere.",
      "The New Shepard capsule's stubby single-stage booster roared to life just after 9:38 a.m. EDT, throttled up to full thrust and smoothly climbed away from Blue Origin's launch site near Van Horn, Texas.",
      "Liftoff came eight days later than originally planned due to high winds in the West Texas desert, but the weather met Blue Origin's safety requirements on Sunday.",
      "The hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine powering the New Shepard fired for about two-and-a-half minutes, accelerating the spacecraft to just under three times the speed of sound. The capsule then separated from the booster and continued coasting upward along its up-and-down trajectory.",
      "At that point, the passengers \u2013 Allie and Carl Kuehner, Leland Larson, Freddie Rescigno Jr., Jim Sitkin and Owolabi Salis, the first Nigerian to fly in space \u2013 began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness.",
      "Free to unstrap and float about the cabin, the passengers were able to take in the view through the largest windows in any operational spacecraft as the ship climbed to an altitude of just above 65 miles. That's about three miles higher than the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The capsule then began falling back to Earth and the passengers returned to their seats for the descent to touchdown. The reusable booster, meanwhile, made its own return to the launch site, dropping tail first to a rocket-powered touchdown.",
      "Floating under three red-and-blue parachutes, the New Shepard capsule touched down a stone's throw from the booster's concrete landing pad, closer than any previous landing. Blue Origin said that it was the result of \"low winds ... and within the safety margins of our predicted models.\"",
      "Blue Origin has now launched 13 passenger flights since the sub-orbital spacecraft carried Amazon and Blue Origin founder Bezos and three others aloft in July 2021. The company has now launched 74 passengers, including Bezos' wife Lauren S\u00e1nchez, and four who have flown twice.",
      "Blue Origin and its passengers do not reveal how much it costs to fly aboard a New Shepard, but it's thought to be more than $500,000 per seat.",
      "The company has had the sub-orbital passenger market to itself since June 2024, when competitor Virgin Galactic, founded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, retired its original rocketplane to focus on building two upgraded Delta-class spacecraft. Virgin is expected to resume flights next year.",

    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

      "\"The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country,\" Musk wrote on X on Saturday as the Senate was scheduled to call a vote to open debate on the nearly 1,000-page bill. \"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\"",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, whose birthday is also Saturday, later posted that the bill would be \"political suicide for the Republican Party.\"",
      "The criticisms reopen a recent fiery conflict between the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency and the administration he recently left. They also represent yet another headache for Republican Senate leaders who have spent the weekend working overtime to get the legislation through their chamber so it can pass by Mr. Trump's Fourth of July deadline.",
      "Musk has previously made his opinions about Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" clear. In late May, just a few days before he officially left his post in the federal government, he told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" he was \"disappointed\" with the bill's price tag.",
      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told CBS News.",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk added. \"But I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.\"",
      "Following a laudatory celebration in the Oval Office, his language became more aggressive and he blasted the bill as \"pork-filled\" and a \"disgusting abomination.\"",
      "\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,\" he wrote on X earlier this month. In another post, the wealthy GOP donor who had recently forecasted that he'd step back from political donations threatened to fire lawmakers who \"betrayed the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump clapped back to say he was disappointed with Musk, back-and-forth fighting erupted and quickly escalated. Musk suggested without evidence that Mr. Trump, who spent the first part of the year as one of his closest allies, was mentioned in files related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The president also threatened to cut off federal subsidies and contracts to Elon Musk's companies. SpaceX receives tens of billions of dollars in federal money, most of which are in the form of federal grants from NASA.",
      "\"He's got a lot of money, he gets a lot of subsidy,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on June 6. \"So we'll take a look at that. Only if it's fair for him and for the country. I would certainly think about it, but it has to be fair.\"",
      "Musk ultimately tried to make nice with the administration, saying he regretted some of his posts that \"went too far.\" Trump responded in kind in an interview with The New York Post, saying, \"Things like that happen. I don't blame him for anything.\"",
      "The shocking rift came after Musk donated $277 million to Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and other Republican candidates in the last election cycle, according to campaign finance records.",
      "It's unclear how Musk's latest broadsides will influence the fragile peace he and the president had enjoyed in recent weeks. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "According to\u00a0data from advocacy group Kids and Car Safety, on average, 38 children die each year from heatstroke inside a vehicle. Since 1990, at least 1,134 children have died in hot cars in the United States and at least another 7,500 survived with varying degrees of injury, according to data compiled by Kids and Car Safety.",
      "Why hot cars are so dangerous for kids",
      "Human-caused climate change keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists say. But the temperature outside doesn't have to be super hot for a child left in a vehicle to be affected by the heat, said Kathy Wall, director of Safe Kids Palm Beach County.",
      "\"Inside, the vehicle can heat up 20 degrees in just 20 minutes,\" Wall said. \"So if you imagine it's an 80 degree day, which in South Florida is a cool day, it could be over 100 degrees within 10 minutes inside the car.\"",
      "Hot car deaths can happen any time of year, and since 1998, every state but Alaska has reported a hot car death, according to the National Safety Council. In both 2018 and 2019, a record 53 children died after being left in hot cars.",
      "About 80% of the heat rise in vehicles happens in the first 30 minutes of a child being left inside, when maximum temperatures can exceed 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), according to data compiled by Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist at San Jose State University.",

Karen Derogatis of Palm Beach County Fire Rescue.",
      "Last week, a 5-year-old boy in Mansfield, Ohio, died after being left in a hot vehicle.",
      "It can happen to anyone",
      "While it's easy to place blame for leaving a child in a vehicle, even people trained to know the dangers have made that tragic mistake, Wall said.",
      "\"It's not a socioeconomic group, it's not a cultural group,\" she said. \"This sadly has happened to doctors, it's happened to dentists, it happened to school teachers, it's happened to child care workers. Nobody is exempt from this.\"",
      "Distraction often leads to forgetting about a child in the backseat, which is why it is important to create routines and reminders, she said.",
      "\"It sounds crazy, but sometimes people get out of routines or are distracted, especially in today's world. There's lots going on in the news, lots going with families,\" she said.",
      "A parent who normally doesn't drop a child off at a day care facility might become distracted and forget that the child is in the vehicle, she said.",
      "Create a reminder that a child is in the backseat",
      "She encourages parents and caregivers to establish routines.",
      "\"We have an acronym, ACT,\" Wall said.",
      "\"A\" stands for avoiding leaving a child unattended in a vehicle. \"C\" stands for creating a reminder that works best for you. Authorities suggest leaving a personal item such as a purse or briefcase in the backseat so you'll have to open the back door before locking the vehicle. \"T\" is to take action right away.",
      "\"If you see a child in a car, don't try to figure out how long they've been in the car. Call 911 immediately,\" Wall said.",

      "Double checking the vehicle is key, said Derogatis, the fire captain.",
      "\"If you make it a common habit, just like you would look in their rear view mirror to see if somebody's behind you, or if you look at your side view mirror to see if you want to switch lanes, make it habit to look in your rearview mirror, whether you have a child or an animal or anything, just to ensure that they are as safe as possible,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Tens of millions of Americans are unable to save for retirement through their jobs. \"That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis,\" one expert says.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are continually encouraged to sock away money in a 401(k) or other retirement plan to ensure a comfortable, if not cushy, life in their later years. Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds.",
      "About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found.",
      "The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings\u00a0to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings.",
      "\"Deeply unequal\"",
      "\"Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,\" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"Nearly half of private sector workers \u2014 56 million people \u2014 lack access to workplace retirement plans. When we include gig, cash and many public-sector workers, the number grows to a staggering 83 million. That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis.\"",
      "About 70% of all U.S. retirement assets are held in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, including 401(k)s and pensions, as well as in government-sponsored plans, the Congressional Research Service found in a 2023\u00a0analysis. The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.",
      "While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month.",
      "\"To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,\" Pew noted in its analysis. \"Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks.\"",
      "Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans.",
      "Creaking Social Security system",
      "While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted.",
      "\"What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,\" she said.",
      "Ghilarducci added, \"Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving.\"",
      "The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary \u2014 or even only \u2014 source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast.",
      "At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income.",
      "Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security.",
      "\"The Pew report is a wake-up call,\" Ghilarducci said. \"If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it \u2014 workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a group of parents who wanted to opt their children out of instruction with storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a group of Maryland parents who challenged their school district's decision to deny them the ability to opt their elementary-aged children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "The high court said in a 6-3 decision\u00a0in the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor that the government burdens parents' religious exercise when it requires their children to participate in instruction that violates the families' religious beliefs. Justice Samuel Alito authored the majority opinion, with the three liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 in dissent.",
      "The court's conservative majority said that the parents who brought the case are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuits proceed. The high court ordered the board to notify parents in advance when one of the story books at issue in the case will be used, and allow them to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "\"[W]e hold that the Board's introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks \u2014 combined with its decision to withhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs \u2014 substantially interferes with the religious development of their children and imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise\" that the court has previously ruled is unacceptable, Alito wrote.",
      "\"We reject this chilling vision of the power of the state to strip away the critical right of parents to guide the religious development of their children,\" Alito added later in the opinion.",
      "Sotomayor read her dissent aloud from the bench. In her opinion, she wrote, \"Simply being exposed to beliefs contrary to your own\" does not amount to prohibiting the free exercise of religion.",
      "\"The result will be chaos for this nation's public schools. Requiring schools to provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent's religious beliefs will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,\" Sotomayor wrote, later warning that it would force courts to resolve a \"new font\" of litigation and leave judges as the decision-makers on policies governing school material related to gender and sexuality.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education and Montgomery County Public Schools said in response to the decision that they are developing next steps and will provide further guidance to schools and families before the start of the next school year.",
      "\"This decision complicates our work creating a welcoming, inclusive, and equitable school system. It also sends a chilling message to many valued members of our diverse community,\" the board and school district said in a joint statement. \"Montgomery County Public Schools remains a welcoming and inclusive school system that embraces and celebrates each and every one of our students. We will maintain an environment where all students feel valued and supported.\"",
      "Mahmoud v. Taylor",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court came in one of three cases before the justices this term that involve religious rights. The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years been sympathetic to plaintiffs raising claims of religious discrimination.",
      "The dispute involves public-school instruction in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is home to the state's largest school system with more than 160,000 students. Montgomery County, like most states, had a policy that allowed parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities to excuse their children, as long as the opt-out requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court filings.",
      "The Montgomery County Education Board added \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks into its English Language Arts curriculum for elementary school students after Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity.\" The school district said it wanted to supplement its Language Arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" The books added include titles like \"Born Ready,\" which is about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" which tells the story of a prince who falls in love with and marries a knight.",
      "Both the majority and dissenting opinions included pages from the storybooks, though the justices disagreed as to their messages.",
      "Alito wrote that the books \"unmistakably convey a particular viewpoint about same-sex marriage and gender,\" and are \"designed to present certain values and beliefs as things to be celebrated and certain contrary values and beliefs as things to be rejected.\"",
      "But in Sotomayor's view, the books introduce readers to LGBTQ characters, but drawn on common themes presented to children in other works, such as overcoming difficulties, celebrating milestones or fairytale romances.",
      "The school board adopted the lessons in 2022 and allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the picture books. But in March 2023, it ended the policy and said families would no longer receive advance notice of when the books would be read, and would not be able to have their children excused from the instruction.",
      "The Board of Education had said that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" since some schools had high numbers of absences. It said all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers had to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, though, sparked backlash throughout the community, with more than 1,000 parents signing a petition that called on the board to restore the opt-outs and dozens appearing at board meetings.",
      "Three Montgomery County families filed a lawsuit against the education board over the decision to end the opt-outs, arguing it violated their First Amendment right to free exercise of religion because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families are a diverse coalition of religions \u2014 Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox.",
      "A federal district court in Maryland and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled for the school board, finding that there was no evidence that the families were compelled to violate their religious beliefs or conduct.",

    "story": [
      "A bison died after it appeared to stumble into a hot spring at Yellowstone National Park last week while visitors looked on.",
      "The incident occurred during the early morning of June 21 at Grand Prismatic Spring near Old Faithful as tourists were enjoying a close-up view of the famous and popular hot spring, according to witnesses and a spokesperson for Yellowstone.",
      "\"There were two bison (standing) there,\" said Louise Howard, who was visiting Yellowstone from Colorado for the first time. \"I thought it was a great photo opportunity.\"",
      "She told CBS News on Friday that one of the bison started walking toward the spring and appeared to step into a shallow part before quickly jumping out. She said that in a manner of about 30 seconds, the bison started walking but stumbled at the edge of the spring and fell in.",
      "\"As hard as it tried, it couldn't get out,\" said Howard, who shared photos on social media.",
      "Rare, but not unheard of",
      "Michael Poland, scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory and a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told CBS News on Friday it is not unprecedented that animals fall into hot springs. He said scientists have found skeletons at hot springs around the park, many of which are in the backcountry, not visited by tourists.",
      "\"There is one pool (in the Lower Geyser Basin) called Skeleton Pool,\" he said. \"What made this a little bit different is that it happened in summer, during the day, at one of the most popular tourist areas in the whole park.\"",
      "Poland said animals usually fall into the hot springs because they are walking too close to the edge and it collapses.",
      "\"There are thin crusts that form on the edges of these and so it's difficult to tell if there is boiling water directly beneath you,\" he said. \"What exactly happened in this case, it's impossible to say.\"",
      "\"There are animals that walk through that area all the time. When you walk on the boardwalk, you can look down into the water, and you can see all kinds of animal footprints \u2014 bison, elk, coyotes, so forth,\" Poland added.",
      "Nothing could have been done",
      "Poland said the bison died fairly quickly after falling into Grand Prismatic, where temperatures reach about 192 degrees Fahrenheit. The boiling point at Yellowstone is about 200 degrees Fahrenheit because of its high altitude.",
      "He said people can tell how hot the springs are based on the color of the bacteria near the edges.",
      "\"All those colorful edges on Grand Prismatic are different bacteria that live at different temperatures,\" he said. \"The red colors are bacteria that like warm water but not scalding and then as you go in from red to yellow to green, it gets to be hotter and hotter. And then the blue water, there is no bacteria there and that's the hottest water, and in many cases, that is really close to boiling.\"",
      "Poland dispelled rumors that the water in Yellowstone hot springs is highly acidic, saying that most springs in the park are actually neutral \u2014 just really hot.",
      "\"What's dangerous is the fact that they are very close to boiling,\" he said. \"Anyone who's poached a chicken knows what that will do to tissue.\"",
      "A cautionary tale for visitors",
      "Millions of tourists visit Yellowstone National Park each year \u2014 particularly in the busy summer season.",
      "This incident \u2014 and the two events of bison goring tourists this year\u00a0\u2014 are a cautionary tale for visitors who want to enjoy the park and everything it has to offer, Poland said.",
      "He urged people to stay on the boardwalks and follow the rules that Yellowstone's rangers have laid out for visitors.",
      "Yellowstone National Park is renowned for its diverse and abundant wildlife. Visitors commonly see bison, elk, bears and other animals, including wolves, moose, mountain goats and mountain lions.",
      "Anyone walking away from the boardwalks risks injury from the hot springs or wildlife but also risks damaging the landscape.",
      "\"The trails are there for a reason. We're in their environment,\" he said of the animals. \"It's a wild place. The landscape is wild too.\"",
      "Front row seat to nature",
      "Katie Kirtzel, from Utah, told CBS News on Friday that she and her family saw the animal's remains later in the day. She said it was about 7:15 p.m., very foggy and \"really eerie and mysterious\" when they spotted animal prints.",
      "\"There were bear tracks and bison tracks and we were taking pictures of those. And as we were following those tracks, the mist starts to clear a little bit and we see a big, large furry animal,\" she said. \"It was huge. You couldn't really tell what it was, but you could tell that something big had recently fallen into the spring.\"",
      "She said seeing the animal was a \"very profound\" and \"unique\" experience.",
      "\"My family and everybody else who was there was kind of taking in the moment, realizing that it was something really special that we walked on,\" Kirtzel said, adding: \"It's so cool to see the cycle (of life) in such an extreme way, right in front of your face.\"",
      "\"I really recommend people visit the park, and I certainly hope that if they do, they keep in mind that this is what we have the parks for,\" Kirtzel added. \"This is nature. This isn't something that's scary. This is something that is natural and incredible to experience if you do.\"",
      "Howard said that despite the tragic incident, the three days she spent at Yellowstone were some of the best of her life.",
      "\"You never get such a front row seat to nature,\" she said, adding: \"I think some people see Yellowstone as a zoo because of how they interact with the animals but it's not. Those animals are wild and they are doing their thing. We are guests in their area.\"",

      "The U.S. economy shrank faster than previously thought during the first three months of 2025, with growth contracting for the first time in three years.",
      "The country's gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 0.5% from January through March, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its third and final GDP report\u00a0for the period. The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",
      "\"What we're witnessing is an economy temporarily buffered from the tariff shock by smart logistics maneuvers, proactive pricing strategies and some foreign exporter concessions,\" Daco said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",
      "Second-quarter rebound?",
      "The category of real final sales to private domestic purchasers includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.

    "summary": "\"It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage,\" IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
    "story": [
      "Iran's nuclear capabilities suffered \"severe damage\" in last week's U.S. airstrikes but not \"total damage,\" said the man in charge of the world's global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. \"One cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.\"",
      "\"It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all,\" IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again.\"",
      "The U.S. launched three strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 21, following more than a week of Israeli attacks, which President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "But Grossi's comments appeared to support an early assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which suggested the strikes had only set back Iran's nuclear program by months. The Trump administration has slammed the DIA's assessment as \"low confidence,\" and Hegseth and other officials on Thursday went after the media for reporting on a \"leaked\" report.",
      "At a briefing Thursday, reporters questioned Hegseth repeatedly on whether Iran had moved its stocks of enriched uranium before the Israeli and U.S. strikes began. The defense secretary responded that he was \"not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be \u2014 moved or otherwise.\"",
      "Grossi on Sunday said Iran did not share that they had any plans to move the enriched uranium, but at the same time \"there was no physical time\" for Iran to share that information.",
      "The IAEA director general also conceded that it's \"logical to presume that when [Iran] announce[s] that they are going to be taking protective measures\" that moving the enriched uranium \"could be part of it.\" But he also emphasized that \"this is why it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brennan pushed Grossi that since it's unclear if the uranium had been moved and all the centrifuges cannot be accounted for, there's an open question that Iran could still \"sprint towards a bomb\u2026if they wanted to.\" Grossi said he didn't want to be an \"alarmist,\" but \"we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened.\"",
      "\"Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there,\" Grossi said. \"The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily.\"",
      "Grossi confirmed that his IAEA inspectors were never able to verify Iran's claims that its nuclear program was only for peaceful ends and that it was not trying to develop a weapon.",
      "\"We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending,\" Grossi said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that there were calls in Iran for the arrest and execution of Grossi.",
      "When asked about alleged threats against nuclear inspectors, Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation\" that Iran is not threatening nuclear inspectors, including Grossi.",
      "Nuclear inspectors \"are in Iran,\" Iravani said. He said they are in a \"safe condition,\" but \"they cannot have access to our site.\"",
      "Iravani also said that since Iran is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nuclear \"enrichment is our right, and an inalienable right, and we want to implement this right.\"",
      "Iravani added that he did not think the enrichment will \"ever stop.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, can you give us some clarity? Does Iran intend to reconstitute a nuclear enrichment program on its soil?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: You know that we are a member, responsible member, of the NPT, and according to the- this treaty, we have the mutual rights. It means that the right of one side will be the obligation of the other side. In the NPT, it has been defined that we have two very explicit right. The first is that we can have research on development, we can have the production of uranium, and we can have, to use, the peaceful energy. And the second right is that the legal protection by the IAEA for our activity and technical cooperation for our development program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: And in return, also, it will be two right for the agency in this regard, that they should have the full access according to the safe, comprehensive safeguard agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: And the second one is that to preserve our peaceful nuclear activity, will remain always in peaceful manner. So the enrichment is our right, and an inalienable right, and we want to implement this right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do plan to restart enrichment, that sounds like?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: I think that enrichment will not- never stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when you mentioned NPT, just for our listeners, you're talking about some of the international agreements Iran has made with the UN on nonproliferation and safeguards. You mentioned the UN nuclear inspectors. Secretary of State Marco Rubio released a statement yesterday saying that there were calls in Iran, this, I believe, is from a newspaper that the Supreme Leader oversees, accusing our prior guest, Rafael Grossi, of being an Israeli spy and calling for his arrest and execution. To be clear, is Iran threatening UN inspectors?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: No, there is no any threat. It is a very clear law of the- our parliament that they have been suspended, our cooperation with IAEA, because the agency has not implemented their rights, their responsibility. Due to this it is a conditional law, and as long as this condition has not been set, so our cooperation with IAEA will be suspended. But whenever it set out as according to the law, so we can have- resume our cooperation. But there is no any threat against the general director of the IAEA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was published in Israel- in Iran's \"Kayhan\" newspaper. Your foreign minister did also say that the IAEA and Grossi himself are malign in intent. Are the IAEA personnel, are the inspectors already inside Iran safe? And can they go back to their work of inspecting your sites?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: Exactly. They are in Iran. They are in the safe condition, but the activity has been suspended. They cannot have accesses to our site, but maybe some one, it is individual, opinion of the people that may criticize the IAEA or threat the general director. But we criticize IAEA. We- our assessment is that they have not done their jobs, so they failed and they prepared [inaudible] for such aggression against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine that you would condemn the calls for his execution?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: Yeah.",

      "AMB. IRAVANI: (INAUDIBLE) --media.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, and you're speaking to us from the UN. President Trump said Friday that Iranian officials want to meet with him personally, and he said that will be soon. Mr. Ambassador, is Tehran planning to drop this demand of indirect communication with the United States, and will you begin speaking with the Trump administration?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: See you, we were in the negotiation, but because we know that any dispute between Iran and United States or other parts of the JCPOA cannot be resolved without the negotiation and using the peaceful means for- to resolve this dispute. So we are in the negotiation, and we are ready for the negotiation, but after this aggression, it is not proper condition for a new round of the negotiation, and there is no request for negotiation and meeting with the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the United States is wanting to meet with Iran to talk, and while the supreme leader issued a statement saying Iran had dealt the U.S. a slap in the face, after that, President Trump said he had actually stopped Israel from going further and had stopped Israel from an attempt to kill your supreme leader. Why not take the offer of a diplomatic lifeline? Because he seems to be offering one.",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: It is very gross violation of the international law that- threatening the Supreme Leader of Islamic Republic of Iran or any head of state, they have impunity from any attack. So we should understand that, what is the principle and condition for any negotiation? Negotiation is- has its- the principles, and it is a give and take process. So we should engage in the negotiation and discuss with each other, maybe we reach to a conclusion or not, but the unconditional surrender is not negotiation. It is dictating the policy toward us. If they are ready for negotiation, they will find us ready for that, but if they want to dictate us, it is impossible for any negotiation with them,",

Good morning. Good to see you.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Dr. Gottlieb, you worked in the first Trump administration. This second Trump administration seems very different in its approach to public health on a lot of fronts. One of them was really laid bare this week with this newly remade Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. Secretary Kennedy had dismissed about 17 members of the existing board and put in some members of his own choice. And in a video, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said federal immunization policy is, quote, 'no longer a credible process' and it's being politicized at the expense of children. That's a pretty stunning statement. Do you agree with the Academy of Pediatrics?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, you're right. I worked in the first Trump administration. I was fortunate to do that and proud to serve in that administration. I think we did a lot of important things on public health. We presided over the first cell and gene therapy approvals. The president tried to expand access to those treatments through the Right to Try legislation that he championed. He supported the FDA on an effort to try to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids, record number of generic approvals, and a lot of other accomplishments. I think a lot of people on my side of the political aisle feel that a lot of these policies that Secretary Kennedy is championing are- are going to be contained to vaccines and not bleed into a broader public health doctrine. I think that's not right. I think there's a lot of people now who don't think these things are particularly political, or shouldn't be, and don't think these decisions should be politically decided, who are going to find when they go to the doctor's office that vaccines that they may want to protect their lives or the lives of their families aren't going to be available. This does look like a political process right now. The secretary is going after issues that have long been bugaboos of him and his anti-vax group, Children's Health Defense. I don't think that's mistakable at this point. I think that he would probably acknowledge that. That he's taking on issues that he's championed for the last 20 years to restrict access to certain vaccines. That's going to grow. The list is growing, and it's going to start to be very tangible for people and go well beyond just the COVID vaccine, which is, I think, what most people think about when they perceive this administration's, or the secretary's efforts, to try to restrict access to vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the specific things from this meeting was advice to avoid flu vaccines containing an ingredient called thimerosal. Right around the same time as the meeting, the CDC removed information from its website that debunked claims that this ingredient was linked to autism. Secretary Kennedy says it's- it's journalists who are obscuring the truth. What do people need to know about the flu vaccine and this ingredient?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so this is an old ingredient. It's a preservative used in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine, primarily. Only a very small percentage of flu vaccine vials still contain it. What it is is an ingredient that's added to multi-dose vials because those vials you're going to go in and out of with different needles as you administer the vaccine to different patients. So they're not single dose injections. They're multi-dose vials that primarily used in some busy clinics, almost exclusively in adults right now. Back in the early 2000s, I was at FDA when we reformulated the vaccine, so we compelled manufacturers to reformulate the vaccines to take this preservative out. Not because we thought it was unsafe, but because there was a lot of consternation among anti-vax groups that they thought that there was a link between this ingredient and autism. The ingredient does contain small amounts of ethylmercury, not methylmercury, ethylmercury, which is the same kind of mercury found in fish, in very small- very small amounts. And so we compelled the manufacturers to reformulate the vast majority of vaccines, still four percent of flu vaccines that get administered, mostly to adults, are from these multi-dose vials. This has long been a bugaboo of the secretary and his group, the Children's Health Defense Fund. In fact, the only presentation at the ACIP meeting was from the head of that group. And you're right that there was a countering analysis from the CDC officials asserting that there's no link between thimerosal and autism. That- that analysis was taken down from the website. The secretary put out a statement that said that it wasn't- it didn't go through proper review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, Dr. Gottlieb, and talk more with you on the other side of this. These are complicated issues I want to dig into with you. So we hope all of you will stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Dr. Gottlieb, just to pick back up, we were talking about the meeting that took place this past week with the newly reconstituted Advisory Committee on Immunization. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, you know him, he's a doctor. He has oversight and chairs the Health Committee. He called for the meeting to be canceled because he said there's no CDC director in place. And when it comes to these appointees, he said many of them 'do not have significant experience studying microbiology, epidemiology or immunology' and they may have 'preconceived bias' against mRNA vaccines. It's- I'm not a doctor, but it seems to me that experience in immunology would be important if you're advising on immunizations. His counsel was ignored here. Is there any check on Secretary Kennedy, at this point? Is there a need to get a CDC director in place quickly?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, well, the CDC director had a confirmation hearing this week, and hopefully she'll be in place soon. I think she's quite strong and a good pick for that job. The board, this ACIP board, isn't fully constituted. There's only seven members on the board. At its peak membership, it has about 15. And you're right, a lot of the people who have been appointed don't have deep experience, or any experience, quite frankly, in vaccine science. They are people who have been ideologically aligned with Secretary Kennedy in the past and worked with him, many of them, not all of them. And I think that that isn't something that even the secretary would probably dispute at this time, and it did lead to some awkward moments at that meeting. For example, you know, one member had to have explained to him the difference between an antibody prophylaxis and a vaccine. So there were evidence in that discussion where the CDC directors had to provide some, quite frankly, remedial assistance to help brief these members on the basis of vaccine science. So it did show, hopefully, once they fully constitute that board, you're going to get more balance on it. I think some people are skeptical. I remain hopeful that there will be some good members that get seated eventually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, one of the things about the American health system is that question of continued innovation. Earlier this month, the FDA approved a twice yearly injection of an HIV prevention drug called lenacapavir. How significant is an innovation like that, and given the environment you're talking about, will these new advisors get in the way of being able to get those kind of things to market?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, this shouldn't come before ACIP. So this is a therapeutic. It's a long acting antiviral that provides six months of protection against HIV and was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection in a population that was high risk of contracting HIV. So it's a change in the formulation of an antiviral that allows it to be administered just twice a year and provide sustained exposure to the benefits of that antiviral. We're seeing a lot of innovation like this. There was also news this week from a small biotech company that I don't have any involvement with, that they had developed a pill that could provide sustained protection against flu. So it's an antiviral, but it is formulated in a way where it- it could be administered once ahead of flu season, to provide protection across the entire season, and also look to be very effective. So we're seeing a lot of innovations like this. What I'm worried about is innovation in vaccine science. I work on the venture capital side, where we make investments in- in new companies, and there has been a pullback of biotech startups that have been looking to develop new vaccines, for example, vaccines for Epstein-Barr Virus, which we know is linked to certain B-cell lymphomas, and maybe is linked to multiple sclerosis. That- that's a new area of science, the potential to vaccinate children against that, much like we vaccinate kids against HPV right now and prevent cervical cancer and other types of cancers. Maybe in the future, we may be vaccinating for EBV, but there's been a lot of pullback to that kind of investment. So I think we're going to see less innovation in vaccine science as a result of the environment we're in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Secretary Kennedy was asked this week about the declarations in some states to start removing fluoride from water. Oklahoma made some moves that direction. He said you're going to see 'probably slightly more cavities,' but 'there's a direct inverse correlation between the amount of fluoride in your water and your loss of IQ.' What should parents be thinking about when they hear things like that?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this has been a long standing issue, another issue that Secretary Kennedy has championed over his career, this perceived- perception that there's a link between fluoride and water and some neurotoxic effects of that. That's been studied thoroughly. It's been, I think, fully debunked. There's very small amounts of fluoride in water, and at the levels that it's put into the water supply, it's been demonstrated to be safe. CDC's- has data showing that there's a 25% reduction in dental caries as a result of fluoride that's added routinely to the water supply. It's not just a question of increased dental cavities, but also oral health more generally, which we know is correlated to systemic health.",

What I'm voting for is a border security measure, $80 billion,\u00a0 $12 billion to reimburse states like mine. I'm voting for $150 billion that will go to our Department of Defense at a time when we saw with Iran, is desperately needed. The world is on fire, Eastern Europe, Indo-Pacific. And then the tax cuts. I mean, if we don't extend these tax cuts, it'll be the largest tax increase in American history for those three reasons. I'm a yes. I think everyone in the House, they know the peril they're in if they vote no on this thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean the peril they're in?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: I think, first of all, it's good for the nation. Secondly, they know that their-their jobs are at risk. Not just from the president, but from the voting- the American people. Our base back home will not reelect us to office if we vote no on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it about reelection, or is it about the policies, right?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No-no. It's about- it's about- it's great for the country, and I've outlined the three top points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to help me understand then- you have such narrow margins in the house, and you look at these projections from like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, they say it violates the House instructions by $500 billion or more, what the Senate just put together here, and that deficits could rise more than $3 trillion. How do you get that through when you have fellow conservatives who are fiscal hawks and saying, I can't get with this, like Chip Roy?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Not to get into the weeds on the economics, but the dynamic scoring is not taken into account here by the Congressional Budget Office. That means that when you cut taxes, you actually get increased revenues to the Treasury. And that's something we saw under President Kennedy, under President Reagan, and under President Bush.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chip Roy and some of these other fiscal conservatives are going to come along for the ride?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, I think at the end of the day, I think they're going to vote for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do. Let's talk about some of the threats that you mentioned there, at home and abroad. You've been briefed on the actions against Iran. The IAEA director told us here that Iran has capabilities and could be up and running within a matter of months. Do you think it is an overstatement by the White House or a mistake to declare mission accomplished?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, first of all, I respect the IAEA. Their job is to inspect not to be an intelligence agency, so they don't really have the clear intelligence analysis that I would attribute to our intelligence community like the CIA. We met with Director Ratcliffe. It was not just his decision. These are career and intelligence officers that have been at the CIA for over 30 years that made this assessment that it was severely damaged and sets a program back a matter of years. In any event, the world and the Middle East is safer today than it was seven days ago, a week ago. That is highlighted by the fact that the proxies didn't light up. Russia didn't come to their- to their aid. China basically ran back for cover. Iran is on its own and psychologically, is very damaged. The deterrence is real. The damage is real. This is a masterful military operation, the likes of which I haven't seen since my father's war, World War Two.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the homeland front, do you then dismiss these concerns about threats? You have the National Terrorism Advisory System that says there's a heightened threat environment in the US. After the strikes, there were federal agents that arrested 11 foreign nationals from Iran, including one who had ties to Hezbollah. Have you seen specific evidence of any kind of threat here in the United States, or is it, as you say, just done and over with?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No, I have. We picked up 11 Iranians, one a sniper, one IRGC, another one, a known suspected terrorist, just within the last couple of days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were they planning to do anything, or did they just happen to have those alliances from the past?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: You know, I don't know all the details, but I will tell you the FBI briefed me in a defensive briefing after Soleimani was killed. I was a part of that--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: -- back in 2020--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that I was under indictment in Iran and that I was on that top target list. So, you know, look- is it imminent? I don't know. We have to take it seriously that there could be sleeper cells in the United States, that could go after people like Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, you know- you know- myself and others that were involved in that decision making and including the president of the United States. We know he's been targeted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to detention of migrants here in the United States, it's a high 59,000 detainees, according to ICE. 47% of them, though, lack a criminal record, fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes. Doesn't that show that the numbers- these aren't the worst of the worst.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Yeah, I was a federal prosecutor for many years. Counterterrorism. You have to prioritize, right? I would prioritize the aggravated felons that my Mayorkas let in, in defiance of federal law. It was shall detain. He said, may detain and let them out into the streets. I would, I would prioritize that first.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you would prefer that Homeland Security prioritize them and not run up the numbers the way they are in this--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: I think they're running the numbers up because 15 to 20 million people came under the- under the Biden administration, and they're trying to get some sanity involved in the United States. And I think deterrence is the key here. And Margaret, it is working. You know, the apprehension rate at the border, and Texas is the biggest one, has gone down to almost zero. I mean, the border is just about secure, catch and release is over, and the threats are going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike McCaul, Congressman, thank you very much for your insights today.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Thanks, Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be back with more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 29, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. He is the Vice Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Good morning.",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been, probably, sleep-deprived with all of what is happening, but I want to ask you about what's going on in Capitol Hill. Republicans are going to pass this along party lines. It's expected, right? But, it includes things in here that Democrats, including you, had supported, right? The no taxes on tips provision, more money for Border Patrol, expansion of the Child Care Tax Credit upwards of $2,000. Why vote against it, when there are popular provisions within it, and doesn't that just allow the President to say, oh, you want to raise taxes?",
      "SEN. WARNER: You can put as much lipstick on this pig as you want. This will- this will be a political albatross for the Republicans --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Why? --",
      "SEN. WARNER: \u00a0-- because it takes 16 million Americans off of health care coverage with cuts to Medicaid, and cuts to the Obamacare marketplace. That will move us, as a nation, back to the same percentage of uninsured we had before- before Obamacare. And, it's not like these people are not going to get sick. They're going to show up at the emergency room. Rural hospitals are going to shut down. That has been evidenced across the nation. It also goes after food assistance. So we are really in such a place that we're cutting, in my state, a couple hundred thousand people off of school lunches, school breakfasts. They even cut food banks. It's- it's cruel. They have also ended up, at the end of the day, cutting 20,000-plus clean energy jobs. And for what? This was to make sure that the highest, most wealthy Americans can get an extra tax-break. And, as you just saw on your chyron, there, it adds $4.5 trillion to the debt. I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their convictions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of the Republicans are arguing, well, we have to deal with these entitlements and the work requirements and things that may lead to some of the lack of qualifications you talk about. They're not that burdensome. It's volunteer work or part-time work. So, are you overstating it?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No. It's 16 million Americans off of health care. You know, Medicaid cuts- these numbers, they're not my numbers. They're all independent sources. And what- the thing that I don't think people have realized is people say, well, Medicaid, I'm not poor. I, maybe, buy my health insurance through the marketplace. Your rates will go up $800 or $900 a month. And that will trickle through the whole rest of the healthcare market, because if you suddenly take people out of the system, they show up at the emergency room in uncompensated care. The only way those costs get passed on, is higher health insurance to all of us who have traditional coverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if this is so against their own interest, why haven't you been able to peel more Republicans away?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I think we'll see. Even as recently as just an hour ago, some of the special Medicaid provisions for certain states, I think, were disallowed because of the so-called Byrd Rule. It's not over until it's over. I will give you- I will grant that President Trump has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner. At the other end, this bill will come back and bite them. This is going to do so much damage in terms of, not only health care, food assistance, you know, the whole notion that we are moving towards cleaner energy jobs, all on the chopping block, adding $4 trillion to the debt.\u00a0Tell me, at the end of the day, how that is good for America? I don't think you can make the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Education is another front in this fight with the President. And I want to ask you about what's happening in Virginia. We saw the University of Virginia's President, James Ryan, resign on Friday. This was extraordinary. This was a pressure campaign from the Trump administration over diversity, or so-called DEI programs. In the letter, and I want to read this, Ryan wrote that if he had tried to fight back, hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld. But, he resigned to avoid this. Is that now the playbook for other university presidents: walk away, don't have the fight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: This is the most outrageous action, I think, this crowd has taken on education. We have great public universities in Virginia. We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the Governor. Jim Ryan had done a very good job; just completed a major capital campaign. For him to be threatened, and, literally, there was indication that they received the letter that if he didn't resign on a day last week, by five o'clock, all these cuts would take place. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- It was that explicit? --",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- It was that explicit. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is- but that sounds personal. That doesn't sound specific to policy or changes. Like, how does the next university president get in line and get the money?",
      "SEN. WARNER: You're shocked it's coming- personal attacks are coming out of this administration? This is, you know- I thought the Republicans were about states' rights. I thought the Republicans were about, let's transfer more power in the States. This federal D.O.E. and Department of Justice should get their nose out of University of Virginia. They are doing damage to our flagship university. And if they can do it here, they'll do it elsewhere. At the end of the day, I understand that, with so many things at stake, that the idea, and I think Jim Ryan laid it out, that he was going to make his personal- personal job more important than these cuts. But, boy, that shouldn't have been the choice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and we know that the universe that the administration is looking at more universities, and the assistant A.G., Harmeet Dhillon, indicated that publicly, and University of California is next to the crosshairs, so we're going to be watching that carefully --",
      "SEN. WARNER: They all want to make them like Harvard. They want to take on public universities, the way they have now taken on the Ivys. End of the day, this is going to hurt our\u00a0universities, chase away what world-class talent. And, frankly, if we don't have some level of academic freedom, then what kind of country are we?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your oversight role on intelligence. You were briefed on what's going on with Iran. You said you fear the American people are being given a false sense of comfort with these declarations of mission accomplished. Do you believe U.S. intelligence knows how much of a capability Iran maintains now?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I don't think we have final assessments. Let me- first of all, we don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Secondly, the military performed an extraordinary mission, and I think they affected a great deal of damage to Iran's facilities. But, the idea that the President of the United States, with no data, two hours after the strike, is suddenly hitting the standard of saying total obliteration. That leads us to think that they are out of the game, and we don't know that yet. And, let's just be clear, you can actually set back the major program where they were trying to create, potentially, and there'd been no decision made by the Ayatollah to actually move towards weaponization, but where they could have a weaponized system with a dozen-plus missiles that are nuclear warned. But what they don't know is they didn't, and this was appropriate, I'm not criticizing the administration; they didn't go after the enriched uranium that was Isfahan, at that base, because it's buried so deeply --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- They just hit it with Tomahawks, not the bunker-busters --",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- So, the fact that they can have, still, enriched uranium, they may have some ability to still cascade that- means they could\u00a0still move forward on something, that might be not delivered by a missile, but a bomb in a trunk of a car. And all I don't want is the American people, or, for that matter, our allies in the region, to rely on a term that was set by the President before he had any facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Point taken there on the specifics of the rudimentary bomb. But, coming back to what you just said, there had been no decision by the Supreme Leader to make a weapon. Secretary of State Rubio, on this program, last Sunday, told me it was irrelevant, the answer to that question, because Iran had everything it needed to make and build a weapon. So, based on what you know, was there an emergency? Was there a reason the US had to act in the moment it did?",
      "SEN. WARNER:\u00a0 We were on the verge of what could have been a much greater war, in terms of Iran and Israel spreading to the whole region. Was there the imminent emergency that would trigger? Because lots of presidents have looked at taking this action, I think that's- that's very debatable. If, at the end of the day, we end up where this peace holds, and Iran doesn't strike back, Hallelujah. But, what we don't know, for example, is Iran going to try to hit us on cyber with this administration cutting, literally, half of our cyber-security personnel in this country? So, I just want to make sure that we- we do this in a measured way. The military did great. We have set them back. But let's not pretend that they don't have any capabilities. And the only way we can get resolution on that, Margaret, and Secretary Rubio acknowledged this in the brief, is if we have boots on the ground with inspectors. That means we've got to go to diplomacy. If America and Iran start negotiating this week, face-to-face, that would be good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we were- we will talk to the man who directs those boots on the grounds, potentially, the inspectors later on in the program from the IAEA. Thank you very much, Senator. We're going to have to leave it there. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the nearly two-year war in the Gaza Strip. Despite an eight-week ceasefire reached just as Mr. Trump took office in January, attempts to bring the sides toward a new agreement have failed, faltering over one major sticking point: whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement.",

The ministry does not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count but says more than half of the dead are women and children.",
      "The Israeli military on Sunday ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians in large swaths of northern Gaza. Col. Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, posted the order on social media. It includes multiple neighborhoods in eastern and northern Gaza City, as well as the Jabaliya refugee camp.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 29, 2025. The interview was taped on June 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, welcome to the program.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Thank you very much, Margaret. Good to talk to you again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director General, there is so much happening. I'm hoping you can walk us through what you know. Iran's foreign minister has said that the damage to their nuclear facilities from the U.S. bombing is significant and serious. We know Israel has also killed a number of top Iranian nuclear scientists. What exactly is Iran's capability at this moment?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, yes, and I think you can pick and choose any adjective to characterize this, but you will see that there is an agreement in describing this as a very serious level of damage. It can be, you know, described in different ways, but it's clear that what happened in particular in Fordo, Natanz, Isfahan, where Iran used to have and still has, to some degree, capabilities in terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment of uranium have been destroyed to an important degree. Some is still standing. So there is, of course, an important setback in terms of those- of those capabilities. This is- this is clear. And now the important issue- the important thing is, what are the next steps? Now the characterization of the damage, I think we can, you know, speculate, and still, until, of course, the Iranians themselves will have to go there and sift through the, you know, rubble and look at what is the exact degree of the damage. At some point, the IAEA will have to return. Although our job is not to assess damage, but to re-establish the knowledge of the activities that take place there, and the access to the material, which is very, very important, the material that they will be producing if they continue with this activity. This is contingent on other, you see, everything is connected. This is- this is contingent on negotiations which may or may not restart, so- so what we see this here, I think we have a snapshot of- of- of a program which has been very seriously damaged, to quote Dr. Araghchi. And now what we need to focus on is on the next steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned there diplomacy. President Trump has been calling for diplomatic talks with Iran to settle all the issues around the nuclear program. I know you were in regular contact with envoy Steve Witkoff. Are you talking to him now? Will the IAEA be involved in any agreement?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, at some point we will have to be, because if his efforts, which I support wholeheartedly, succeed, this will come to a point where there is some agreement, some understanding on things that Iran will continue doing, and some things where there could be an agreement on certain restrictions. And of course, who is going to verify that is the IAEA so this is why we're in constant contact. Now they need to reconnect. And it's not going to be easy, one can imagine, after the traumatic events that took place. Even for us, you may have seen that I wrote to Foreign Minister Araghchi a few days ago, immediately, I would say, after the cease-fire was considered to be holding, and I said to him that we should perhaps sit down and analyze in a gradual way the reconnection, the modalities for the inspectors to go- to go back. So there is a level where the IAEA is not involved, and this is the direct conversation. What is the deal? And then, of course, we will be connecting to make sure that that deal stands and it's verifiable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to that point, Tehran just passed a law saying they want to suspend cooperation with the IAEA inspectors. The foreign minister said he had no plans to let you personally, Mr. Director General, into the country. Does that mean Iran will completely block all inspectors? Do those you already have in the country have any access?",
      "GROSSI: Well, certainly I hope this is not the case. I think that what the foreign minister said is that they were looking into this law and how this law would impact our activities. I think it's time- this is why it's so important that we sit down around the table and we look into this. Iran- and I think nobody has put that in question, and I hope nobody will, is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, like more than 190 countries in the world. So- so, that implies that they have to work with the- with the agency. So we have to go- we have been going through this law that they have, that the Majles approved, and we see that they are talking about cooperation on the basis of- of the security and the safety of their sites. I think that is not incompatible with the inspection work that needs to take place. But of course, it's not Rafael Grossi and Margaret Brennan discussing this that we are going to solve it. I think we- I have to sit down with- with- with Iran and look into this, because at the end of the day, this whole thing, after the military strikes, will have to have a long lasting solution, which cannot be but a diplomatic one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're not kicking- they're not kicking out your inspectors at this point?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Not in this sense. I would not say that I am looking with interest and with some concern what they have approved. But of course, it's their law. It is their parliament. But you know, here there are legal implications. An international treaty, of course, takes precedence. You cannot invoke an internal law not to abide with an international treaty. But Iran is not saying that at the moment, and I think this is constructive. So this is why I think we have to go down into the details, because the work will have to continue, otherwise nobody will have an idea of what is happening in Iran. Iran will continue with a nuclear program, the contours of which are still to be seen and will be I am sure, part of these negotiations, which I hope, will be resuming soon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran officially reported weeks ago that they were going to take measures in advance of these strikes to try to protect their nuclear assets. Did they share with the IAEA what those plans were? Where they were going to stash things like centrifuges, the machines that help enrich fuel? Where they were going to put the gas canisters that have enriched uranium?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: No, no, they did not inform that- that to us, but at the same time, there was no physical time, perhaps, to do it. Iran, for example, had announced to us that they had a new enrichment facility in Isfahan, and we were going to go on the 13th of June to- to check on that facility so that- and the site has been severely damaged and hit. So this is why I say it is indispensable. We will have to, aggravation or not, feelings and emotions or not, there has to come a point with- with cool heads. We sit around the table and- and see what- I mean, these protective measures, of course, it's their right to protect their assets, like any other sovereign nation. They can, of course, protect- but they know and there are, I don't want to get too technical or legalese here in this conversation, but there are provisions in the agreements we have, not only with Iran, with any- with any country. If a country at a- at a moment, feels that some of the things we inspect must be protected or whatever, they have to tell us, and we have to go, etc., etc., as you can imagine. So, this could not happen because of the unfolding of the circumstances, of a military conflict where, of course, you know, decisions are taken and this is not planned or announced, obviously. So now- now it's the time to reconnect and to talk and to talk to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, but there was roughly 400 kilograms, which is just under 900 pounds, of highly enriched uranium, before the attacks. I know these are in small canisters and relatively easy to move. Do you have any idea where that was moved, and if it was moved before the attack?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: We presume, and I think it's- it's logical to presume that when they announce that they are going to be taking protective measures, this could be part of it. But, as I said, we don't know where this material could be, or if part of it could have been, you know, under the attack during those 12 days. So some could have been destroyed as part of the attack, but some could have been moved. So there has to be at some point a clarification. If we don't get that clarification, this will continue to be hanging, you know, over our heads as- as a potential problem. So this is why I say it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I ask you about what things might still remain, because there's that open question of could Iran sprint towards a bomb even now, if they wanted to. If we don't know where the highly enriched uranium is and cannot account for all the centrifuges, is that still a risk that they could be rushing towards a bomb?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, you know, I- we don't want to be alarmists here, and I don't want to be part of, you know, a messaging that would be spreading, as I say, alarm. But we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened. Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there. The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily. You are going to have an agreement. You are going to have an inspection system that will give everybody, everybody in the region and- and- and elsewhere, the assurances that we can- we can definitely turn the page.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So up until right before the strikes, the IAEA still had inspectors, as I understand it, going to some of these sites. There's been a lot of focus here in America on the trucks and satellite images of them outside of Fordo. What was happening in those days before the strike?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, as- as you were pointing out there were- there was an announcement of protective measures that could have included moving equipment and material. We don't know. We saw the same images that the whole world has seen of these trucks, and we don't want to get into any rush conclusion about it, but it is, it is clear that we need the things that we ignore, okay. And after a reasonable period, after the war, there has to be a process that needs to continue. Otherwise the uncertainties will continue, will continue to linger on. And this is, you know, in a final analysis, not good, and perhaps even preventing a good agreement, because who is going to have an agreement where you don't know what the counterpart really has? What are the assets that they really have after the- after this- this- this military campaign that took place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So up until these strikes Iran- Iran was still disclosing information to the IAEA--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: --Well yes, yes, yes, yes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013-In certain amounts--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: There were deficits. There were deficits, and we were referring to those in the- in the sense that there were some things that they were not clarifying to us. But our inspection work was- was constant. In particular, in this sensitive area of the number of centrifuges and the amount of material, we had perfect view. We didn't have view on other things that we wanted to have. But on this one, it was- it was complete. It was comprehensive. And, of course, at the moment, there is- there is nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran wasn't keeping its stockpile of enriched uranium secret. The world was concerned--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: --No--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You said you were concerned about it. What do you think it was intended for? And did you see anything that suggested they were looking to weaponize?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: They- let me be clear here, because we said, first of all, something very, very important. They have all these capabilities, but for the agency, they- first of all, they didn't have nuclear weapons. Okay? This needs to be said. One can have an assessment nationally that they were close, okay? And I don't get into that, because we, the IAEA, does not judge intentions. The IAEA looks at the activities of a country and reports it to the world. So it is countries that- that say, well, this is of concern or not. What we were concerning- what- what I was concerned about is that there were other things that were not clear. For example, we had found traces of uranium in some places in Iran, which were not the normal declared facilities. And we were asking for years, why did we find these traces of enriched uranium in place x, y or z? And we were simply not getting credible answers. If there was material- where is this material? So there could be even more. We don't know. This is why it is, I'm sorry I'm repeating it for the third time, I think we need to go back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, understood. But your statement and that report that you gave about some of these open questions or unanswered questions, the Iranians are pointing to it now, and the foreign minister seems to be sort of blaming you for the military strikes. He said it wasn't honest and fair, your report. He said, after the facilities, you didn't even condemn the strikes- after the strikes, I should say. What do you make of those criticisms?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well- I, to an extent, I understand. They have been under attack. But, really, who can believe that this conflict happened because of a report of the IAEA? And, by the way, what was- what was in that report was not new, Margaret. We have been saying that for a long time, and in previous reports as well. So, this- maybe it's because it's easier, maybe, to criticize an international organization or a director general, I don't know, but it's not reasonable to say that. And, if anything, the IAEA, as always, has had a very honest assessment of the situation. And there were many, I can assure you, there were many that- that were saying in your report, you must say that they have nuclear weapons, or they are very close to have nuclear weapons. And we didn't. We simply didn't, because this was not what we were seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you also said you couldn't verify that it was a peaceful program.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Absolutely, because we have to see everything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: They did- we didn't see them. We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending. So this is- this is the truth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I appreciate the nuance here, because there's so much gray. People here are looking for clarity, and there's confusion in the United States. CBS is reporting that the Defense Intelligence Agency assesses Iran's program was set back a few months, but once they dig out, they could resume in a number of months. They have to rebuild electrical and water supplies. The CIA and the National Intelligence directors say the facilities were destroyed, and it would take years to rebuild. Israel says the military program is set back many years. What's the truth here? What do you make of these assessments?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: You know- you know what, this hourglass approach in weapons of mass destruction is- is not a good idea. Remember, we had cases 45 minutes and so on, which were quite- quite off spot. All of that depends on your metrics, Margaret. If you tell me it will take them two months or three months, for what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.",
      "Because, first of all, as I- and I think the intelligence- we are not there making any military evaluations, first of all, but, out of the logic of our conversation, it is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all. And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again. This is again- and I'm sorry, fourth time, we have to go back to the table and have a technically sound solution to this. Otherwise, this will come hit us again, in terms of a situation which is not well clarified. And this is an opportunity. We do have an opportunity now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, and we will see if that opportunity is picked up by either side. Director General, thank you for your time today.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Thank you, as always, a pleasure. Thank you very much.",

      "Late last month, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff\u00a0proposed a 60-day ceasefire. Under that proposal, Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages who were taken to Gaza during Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel, according to a copy obtained by CBS News.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-city-ruled-by-females-catalhoyuk/",
    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:26:47 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers said their findings suggest husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage \u2013 suggesting a female dominance.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wander Franco, the suspended Tampa Bay Rays shortstop charged in a sexual abuse case, was found guilty on Thursday in the Dominican Republic but received a two-year suspended sentence.",
      "Franco was arrested last year after being accused of having a four-month relationship with a girl who was 14 at the time, and of transferring thousands of dollars to her mother to consent to the illegal relationship.",
      "Franco, now 24, also faced charges of sexual and commercial exploitation against a minor, and human trafficking, but was found not guilty of those.",
      "Judge Jakayra Veras Garc\u00eda said Franco made a bad decision as she addressed him during the ruling.",
      "\"Look at us, Wander,\" she said. \"Do not approach minors for sexual purposes. If you don't like people very close to your age, you have to wait your time.\"",
      "Prosecutors had requested a five-year prison sentence against Franco and a 10-year sentence against the girl's mother, who was found guilty and will serve the full term.",
      "\"Apparently she was the one who thought she was handling the bat in the big leagues,\" Veras said of the mother and her request that Franco pay for her daughter's schooling and other expenses.",
      "Franco's attorney, Irina Ventura, said she would appeal the judge's ruling: \"Evidently, justice was not done.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutor Luis Mart\u00ednez said he was pleased with the rulings but did not say whether the government would appeal.",
      "Before the three judges issued their unanimous ruling, Veras orally reviewed the copious amount of evidence that prosecutors presented during trial, including certain testimony from 31 witnesses.",
      "\"This is a somewhat complex process,\" Veras said.",
      "More than an hour into her presentation, Veras said: \"The court has understood that this minor was manipulated.\"",
      "As the judge continued her review, Franco looked ahead expressionless, leaning forward at times.",
      "Franco, who was once the team's star shortstop, had signed a $182 million, 11-year contract through 2032 in November 2021 but saw his career abruptly halted in August 2023 after authorities in the Dominican Republic announced they were investigating him for an alleged relationship with a minor. Franco was 22 at the time.",
      "In January 2024, authorities arrested Franco in the Dominican Republic. Six months later, Tampa Bay placed him on the restricted list, which cut off the pay he had been receiving while on administrative leave.",
      "He was placed on that list because he has not been able to report to the team and would need a new U.S. visa to do so.",
      "While Franco awaited trial on conditional release, he was arrested again in November last year following what Dominican authorities called an altercation over a woman's attention. He was charged with illegally carrying a semiautomatic Glock 19 that police said was registered to his uncle.",
      "That case is still pending in court.",
      "After the ruling, Major League Baseball issued a brief statement noting it had collectively bargained a joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy \"that reflects our commitment to these issues.\"",
      "\"We are aware of today's verdict in the Wander Franco trial and will conclude our investigation at the appropriate time,\" MLB said.",

According to the prosecution, the government showed that Diddy didn\u2019t take no for an answer.

      "However, the defense did find a way to show the jury a different explanation in an attempt to undermine the government's argument. \"Defense got an employee of one of the companies to say that Diddy was just buying the escorts' time and not any sexual performance, which the jury could use as a basis to acquit Diddy on the transportation charges,\" Faddis, a founding partner of Colorado-based Varner Faddis, said.",

That could lead to a hung jury on one or more of the charges. But the jurors spent the entire trial waiting to see how Diddy's lawyers rebutted the massive case against him, and they merely rested without putting on any witnesses. That leaves the jury picking through the government's case to see if this really rises to racketeering, and if not, they may hang or acquit on some of the charges \u2013 but it's unlikely.\"",

      "As Diddy's defense attorney, Marc Agnifilo, ended his closing argument, he pointed the jury to the quality of the evidence shown by the prosecution. \"That matters,\" he explained.",

      "During the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said that Diddy thought \"he was untouchable.\"",
      "\"For 20 years, the defendant got away with his crimes\u2026 that ends in this courtroom\u2026the defendant is not a God,\" she said. Comey ended by telling the jury, \"It is time to hold him accountable. Find him guilty.\"",
      "At the start of the defense's closing argument, Diddy's attorney accused the prosecution of bringing a \"fake trial\" against the \"Last Night\" rapper as the government went after his \"private sex life.\"",
      "Diddy's defense claimed none of the prosecution witnesses testified to engaging in racketeering. Agnifilo pointed out the disgraced music mogul's former employees all described working for him as hard, but also said it was like \"going to Harvard Business School.\"",

So I just wanted to put on the record that we think it would be objectionable and crossing a line for any summation to bring up politics or current events or the propriety of this prosecution and the use of government resources. I would hope that Mr. Agnifilo would not cross over those lines, but I just wanted to say that if he did, I would object in the middle of his summation and ask the Court to instruct the jury to disregard any comments like that.

    "summary": "Kristina &quot;KK&quot; Khorram faces scrutiny in Diddy&apos;s sex trafficking trial after testimony revealed her alleged involvement in drug transportation and concealing assault evidence.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News' Alexis McAdams reports the latest on the trial from New York City.",
      "Closing arguments in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial began Thursday, more than seven weeks after jurors were seated for the case. While the Bad Boy Records founder was the focus of the government's charges, his former chief of staff, Kristina (KK) Khorram, was brought up throughout witnesses' testimony, though she never testified nor was charged.",
      "KK was previously compared to Jeffrey Epstein's righthand woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, in a lawsuit brought against her and Diddy in March 2024. Music producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones claimed he witnessed KK ordering sex workers for Diddy. KK also had all the assistants keep drugs ready for Diddy at a moment's notice, according to Jones' allegations.",
      "\"From what we\u2019ve seen so far, the comparison between Kristina Khorram and Ghislaine Maxwell isn\u2019t really a fair one, given that Epstein\u2019s victims were underage girls,\" John J. Perlstein explained to Fox News Digital. \"Still, Khorram is an alleged co-conspirator in the Diddy case, so it makes sense that she wouldn\u2019t want to testify, as she would\u2019ve likely had to plead the Fifth.\"",
      "DIDDY BLOWS KISS TO FAMILY AFTER PROSECUTION PROMISES TO PUT A STOP TO HIS ALLEGED CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR",

      "\"While Ghislaine Maxwell was not originally charged in the Jeffrey Epstein case, charges were eventually filed against her,\" the Los Angeles-based litigator added. \"That\u2019s likely what we see happening here with Khorram and the Diddy case. However, the criminal enterprise case against Diddy is extremely weak, and it\u2019s possible that the case against Khorram would be even weaker.\"",
      "During Diddy's sex trafficking and racketeering trial, prosecutors claimed the music mogul was the leader of the alleged criminal enterprise. His inner circle included his chief of staff, assistants and security.\u00a0Diddy's ex-girlfriend, Jane, testified KK was the rapper's \"righthand woman.\" The government claimed KK lived in Diddy's home in Miami and knew what he was doing all the time. She even allegedly responded to people from his phones.",
      "According to the prosecution, Diddy and his staff were involved in purchasing and distributing drugs. Jane testified that KK helped her transport drugs across state lines. KK was seemingly aware Diddy's assistants were purchasing drugs for the rapper. In texts shown during Brendan Paul's testimony, he asked KK for reimbursement.",

      "\"You never call a witness or ask a question that you don't know,\" Becker, who worked on R. Kelly's case, told Fox News Digital. \"So, in this case, if no one was able to actually have these deep conversations with KK and know exactly what she was going to testify to, she could have actually been a thorn in the government's side.\"",

Now, the question becomes, 'Well, if KK is the one who was responsible for some of the very criminal activities that they're now putting on P. Diddy, why isn't she charged with the same types of crimes?'",
      "\"From a legal strategy standpoint, the big fish is who you go after,\" Becker added. \"Who's the big fish that the public knows? Who is the hip-hop mogul that we all know of?

The Brooklyn-born 71-year-old famously survived a mob hit in 1992 in which he was shot multiple times inside a moving taxi before jumping out through a window.",
      "\"The only way you get me out of this race before Nov. 4 is in a coffin, in a pine box,\" he said. \"And people know the Gottis and Gambinos tried that in 1992, and it didn't work and this won't work either. Be prepared to see Curtis Sliwa on the Republican line on Nov. 4.\"",
      "Sliwa has led the Guardian Angels since 1979 and said what separates him from the field is simple: He rides the subways, talks to the people and knows the neighborhoods by heart.",
      "\"I\u2019m the only real tried and true New Yorker. Andrew Cuomo hasn\u2019t lived in the city since 1990. Mamdani goes back and forth to Uganda. Eric Adams? He lives in Fort Lee,\" Sliwa said in a dig at Adams owning a property in New Jersey. \"As goes the subway, so goes New York City. That\u2019s our veins and arteries. None of these other guys are in the system. I live there.\"",
      "Political experts consider Sliwa\u2019s election bid as a long shot. He ran against Adams in the 2021 election and lost by 66.1% to 27.4%. But the chips could finally fall Sliwa\u2019s way in November if the left and center vote splits \u2013 with voters balking at Mamdani\u2019s far-left agenda and both Adams and former Cuomo siphoning off Democratic votes with Independent runs.",

      "He also thinks his no-kill policy for the city\u2019s animal shelters will bring in moderate Democrats, women voters, younger generations and animal advocates who might not typically support a Republican candidate. Sliwa is known for his deep love of cats, often highlighting his devotion to rescuing and caring for strays.",
      "Sliwa scoffed at the notion that Mamdani\u2019s social media influence could be a deciding factor, arguing the race will be won by connecting with people on the ground. The assemblyman has nearly 2 million followers on Instagram, compared to Sliwa\u2019s 66,000, while the socialist candidate has more than 910,000 followers on TikTok compared to Sliwa\u2019s 183,000.",

That just pushes them into Mamdani\u2019s camp.\"",
      "A Trump endorsement could also shift momentum in Sliwa\u2019s favor. Though he called his relationship with the president a \"love-hate\" one, Trump\u2019s rallies in the Bronx and at Madison Square Garden last year suggest a shifting political tide in the city \u2013 and a joint appearance with Sliwa could prove a game-changer.",

      "But Sliwa said he is open to receiving Trump\u2019s backing, even if the race is not on the president\u2019s radar.",
      "\"Well, if it comes, that's fine. If it doesn't come, remember I ran the last time, I was not endorsed by President Trump,\" Sliwa said. \"[Trump] did not endorse Eric Adams. He basically stayed out of the race.

      "Dan Shapiro, who previously served as the deputy assistant secretary of Defense for the Middle East and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, said he didn\u2019t put a lot of stock in both overly pessimistic or overly optimistic assessments that emerged quickly, and said that the initial assessment from DIA was likely only based on satellite imagery.",
      "\"That's one piece of the puzzle of how you would really make this assessment,\" Shapiro, now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Fox News Digital. \"You'd really want to have to test all the other streams of intelligence, from signals intelligence, human intelligence, other forms of monitoring the site, potentially visits by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, potentially visits by other people.

      "A few hundred robots moved a buildng complex covering about 43,400 square feet.",
      "Shanghai is no stranger to jaw-dropping feats of engineering.",
      "In the latest example, a Shanghai historic building moved by robots is capturing global attention. The relocation of the complex in Huayang, a Shikumen-style building weighing about 7,500 metric tons (approximately 8,267 U.S. tons) and covering roughly 43,400 square feet, is truly rewriting the rules.",
      "This ambitious project is powered by an army of 432 small robots that are moving the massive structure about 33 feet each day to make way for a new underground development. Let's dive into how this is happening, why it matters and what it means for the future of urban preservation.",

      "Over 400 small robots are moving the complex in Huayang. (Shanghai Government)",
      "What makes the Shanghai historic building moved by robots so special?",
      "The Huayanli complex is a set of three brick-and-wood buildings constructed between the 1920s and 1930s. Located in the heart of Shanghai's historic Zhangyuan area, these structures are classic examples of shikumen architecture, which is a unique blend of Western and Chinese design. Zhangyuan itself is over 140 years old and is one of Shanghai's largest and best-preserved shikumen neighborhoods.",

      "DELIVERY ROBOT AUTONOMOUSLY LIFTS AND TRANSPORTS HEAVY CARGO",
      "Why is a Shanghai historic building being moved by robots?",
      "The relocation is not just for show. The city is building a three-story underground center beneath the complex that will include over 570,000 square feet of cultural and commercial space, a parking garage with more than 100 spots and a transportation hub that will connect three major subway lines. By preserving the historic Huayanli complex above ground while adding modern infrastructure below, Shanghai is finding a smart balance between honoring its heritage and embracing progress.",

      "The challenges: Tight spaces and dense history",
      "Moving a building of this size is tough enough, but the challenge is multiplied by Zhangyuan's dense web of narrow alleys and closely packed historic buildings. Traditional relocation methods simply would not fit. The area's historic significance also means that any mistake could damage irreplaceable architecture, including the 1928 \"great hall\" that once housed a patriotic night school.",

      "Instead of using cranes or bulldozers, engineers put 432 small walking robots to work. These robots gently lift the building and slowly move it forward, inch by inch, covering about 33 feet each day. To achieve this incredible level of precision, the project relies on several advanced technologies. Special low-clearance drilling robots, which can be operated remotely, navigate tight corridors and doorways to create new foundations beneath the historic structure.",
      "Earth-moving robots equipped with folding mechanical arms, just under four feet wide, use artificial intelligence to tell the difference between clay and solid obstacles. Engineers also use building information modeling and point cloud scanning to create highly detailed 3D blueprints. These digital models help the team plan exact movement routes, avoid potential collisions and design curved paths for removing soil.",
      "To keep the construction site efficient and minimize disruption, soil is carried out using a conveyor belt system, much like an assembly line. The move is only temporary. Once the underground construction is finished, the Huayanli complex will be carefully returned to its original spot, fully restored and preserved, now sitting atop a modern underground facility.",

      "Over the past decade, software companies have built solutions for nearly every industry, including healthcare. One term you might be familiar with is software as a service (SaaS), a model by which software is accessed online through a subscription rather than installed on individual machines.",
      "In healthcare, SaaS providers are now a common part of the ecosystem. But, recently, many of them have made headlines for the wrong reasons.",
      "Several data breaches have been traced back to vulnerabilities at these third-party service providers.

      "Episource, a big name in healthcare data analytics and coding services, has\u00a0confirmed a major cybersecurity incident (via\u00a0Bleeping Computer). The breach involved sensitive health information belonging to over 5 million people in the United States. The company first noticed suspicious system activity Feb. 6, 2025, but the actual compromise began ten days earlier.",

      "Episource claims there\u2019s no evidence the information has been misused, but because they haven\u2019t seen the fallout yet doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t happening. Once data like this is out, it spreads fast, and the consequences don\u2019t wait for official confirmation.",

      "The healthcare industry has embraced cloud-based services to improve efficiency, scale operations and reduce overhead. Companies like Episource enable healthcare payers to manage coding and risk adjustment at a much larger scale. But this shift has also introduced new risks. When third-party vendors handle patient data, the security of that data becomes dependent on their infrastructure.",
      "Healthcare data is among the most valuable types of personal information for hackers. Unlike payment card data, which can be changed quickly, medical and identity records are long-term assets on the dark web. These breaches can lead to insurance fraud, identity theft and even blackmail.",
      "Episource is not alone in facing this kind of attack. In the past few years, several healthcare SaaS providers have faced breaches, including Accellion and Blackbaud. These incidents have affected millions of patients and have led to class-action lawsuits and stricter government scrutiny.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from healthcare data breach",
      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted. This kind of indirect relationship muddies the waters when it comes to responsibility and makes it even harder to demand transparency or hold anyone accountable.",

      "Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.",
      "Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer\u2019s phone number, making them even harder to detect.",

      "This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can\u2019t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It\u2019s not just phishing, it\u2019s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.",
      "Why this PayPal phishing attack is so dangerous",
      "This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.",
      "The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.",

The process starts when the device pulls in ambient air. Inside, advanced materials capture the water vapor in the air. That moisture is then heated to kill any microbes, and it passes through a dual-stage UV sterilization system and a carbon filter to remove impurities, bacteria and particles.",
      "Once the water is purified, the Kara Pod adds essential minerals like calcium, magnesium and sodium. This turns into healthy, mineral-rich water that is ready to drink or brew with. The device can make up to 3.2 liters, which is about a gallon, of premium alkaline water every day. This water is stored in an internal tank that is always kept topped up so you never have to worry about running out or refilling it yourself.",

    "summary": "A Facebook scammer posing as Elon Musk tricked a victim with promises of a Tesla and $250,000, requesting gift cards that become untraceable once the codes are shared.",
    "story": [
      "Watch out for this Zelle scam on facebook marketplace. Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson explains why.",
      "It started with a Facebook friend request and a message that felt too good to be true.",
      "Then,\u00a0it quickly turned into an expensive lesson in online deception.",
      "The woman this happened to in Jensen Beach, Florida, wrote us saying, \"He kept telling me it was my lucky day. I had just won a new white Tesla and $250,000 in cash. All I needed to do was send him an Apple Gift Card for $200. So I did. Well, $800 later, he wanted more to pay for the broken-down truck that was on its way to my house to deliver my winnings.\"",
      "The scammer, posing as Elon Musk, used flattery, fake urgency and a convincing profile to lure the victim into a carefully staged hoax. Behind the big promises was someone who walked away with hundreds of dollars in untraceable gift cards. Here\u2019s how the scam works and how you can avoid falling for it.",

      "A CLOSE CALL WITH A FACEBOOK SCAM THAT TRIED TO STEAL CREDIT CARD INFO",
      "A person trying a Tesla vehicle. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Elon Musk Tesla Facebook scam works",
      "This type of scam often begins after someone posts about Musk, Tesla or cryptocurrency. Scammers monitor public Facebook activity, then send a friend request from an account using Musk\u2019s name and photo. The profile may look legitimate, with copied images, reposted news articles or AI-generated content.",
      "Once the request is accepted, the impersonator encourages the victim to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. From there, the scam unfolds in a way that feels casual but calculated. The victim is congratulated on being randomly selected to win a brand-new Tesla and a large cash prize, often around $250,000. But before the reward can be delivered, they are told to cover \"delivery fees\" using an Apple Gift Card.",
      "In the case of the woman from Jensen Beach, she sent multiple gift cards totaling $800 before realizing the story was a setup. After claiming that a delivery truck had broken down, the scammer requested even more money. That's when she recognized the pattern and blocked the account. But unfortunately, by then, the funds were already gone.",

      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES AND AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Why scammers prefer gift cards in online scams",
      "Gift cards are one of the most common tools used in scams because they are fast, anonymous, and nearly impossible to recover once the code is shared. Scammers often claim that the cards are needed to cover fees, unlock a prize or verify your identity. Once a scammer has the code, they can do a few things:",

      "Sell the card on online marketplaces at a discount",
      "Launder the funds through reselling sites or gaming platforms.",
      "Apple Gift Cards are frequently used because they are easy to find in stores and can be used for high-value digital purchases. But scammers also use Google Play, Amazon, Steam and Visa prepaid cards, depending on what they think the victim can access. These requests usually come with urgency. Victims may be told to stay on the phone while buying the cards or to scratch off the back and send a photo of the code right away. That sense of pressure is designed to override second thoughts. If anyone you do not know asks for payment in gift cards, it is a scam. No legitimate organization or contest will ever ask for them as payment or verification.",

      "Other Elon Musk impersonation scams to know about",
      "Scams that impersonate celebrities or public figures have become increasingly common. Criminals use well-known names to create a false sense of trust and urgency. Once they have your attention, they use that trust to steal money or personal information. Musk is one of the most frequently impersonated figures in scam campaigns. His name is widely associated with innovation, crypto and high-value giveaways, which makes him a perfect target for fraudsters trying to appear legitimate. Some of the most common Elon-related scams include:",
      "Energy-saving device scams: One scam used Musk\u2019s photo and fake testimonials to promote a suspicious energy product through Facebook ads. The ad was styled to look like a real news article, which made it harder to spot as a fake.\u00a0Read more about the energy-saving scam here.Fake investment opportunities: In one case, a scammer convinced a woman she was in a relationship with Musk and persuaded her to invest in a business venture. She lost over $26,000 before realizing it was a hoax.Crypto giveaway livestreams: These scams often appear on YouTube or in ads, claiming that Musk is hosting a giveaway. Victims are told to send cryptocurrency with the promise of getting double in return. In reality, the money is taken and never returned.",

      "What ties these scams together is the use of a familiar face to lower suspicion. The scammer may use deepfake video, AI-generated voice clips or doctored screenshots to make the offer feel more real. Once the target engages, the pressure begins. Victims are asked to send money, act quickly and avoid telling anyone. If a message or ad involves a celebrity offering free money, discounted products or special access to a private opportunity, it is almost certainly a scam.",

      "These scams rely on quick decisions, emotional reactions and a false sense of trust. Slowing down and checking for warning signs can help you stay safe. Here are some practical steps:",
      "1. Never send gift card codes to anyone you do not know: If someone asks for Apple, Amazon or Google Play cards as payment or verification, it is a scam. No real prize, agency or company will request gift cards.",
      "2. Be skeptical of prize claims from celebrity accounts: Musk is not messaging people on Facebook to give away Teslas or cash. If the profile is unverified or the offer feels random, trust your instincts and ignore it.",
      "3. Do not move conversations to private apps like WhatsApp or Telegram: Scammers often push for this because these platforms have fewer safeguards, no public comment threads and limited reporting tools. Once the chat moves off Facebook, it becomes much harder to verify or report what\u2019s happening. If someone you do not know insists on switching platforms, it\u2019s usually a sign they are hiding something.",
      "4. Consider using a data removal service: If a scammer has targeted you or impersonated you online, chances are your personal information is floating around on data broker websites. These sites collect and sell everything from your home address to your family members\u2019 names, making you a bigger target for future scams. Data removal services can help you scan the web and request the deletion of your info from these brokers. While you can do this manually, it\u2019s time-consuming. Services like\u00a0Incogni offer subscriptions that automate the process and monitor for new exposures. If you\u2019ve been scammed or suspect your information was leaked, using a data removal service adds another layer of protection and peace of mind.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "5. Watch for common red flags: Be cautious of sudden friend requests from unfamiliar accounts, vague messages that mention surprise winnings, poor grammar or any pressure to act quickly. Scammers often use emotional triggers to override your judgment. If something feels off or too convenient, it probably is.",
      "6. Install strong antivirus software on all devices: Some impersonation scams include links to phishing pages or malware. Antivirus tools can block these threats before they reach your inbox. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Use two-factor authentication and a password manager: If a scam compromises your login credentials,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) can block unauthorized access. A password manager also helps protect against reused or weak passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "8. Report the scam right away: Use\u00a0Facebook\u2019s reporting tools to flag fake profiles or messages. You can also file a complaint with the FTC at\u00a0ReportFraud.ftc.gov to help warn others.",

      "Scammers are using Musk\u2019s name to run fake prize scams, investment traps and Facebook impersonation schemes. In one case, a reader lost $800 after being promised a Tesla and $250,000 in cash, but only if they sent Apple Gift Cards first. These scams rely on trust, speed and celebrity recognition. The real Musk is not sending private messages to strangers. If someone contacts you about a prize and asks for money or gift cards, it is a scam. Report it, block the account and help others stay alert.",

      "Security researchers emphasize that this isn't the result of a new, single breach. Instead, it's a massive collection of previously stolen credentials from various past leaks, phishing scams and third-party data exposures, some of which were forgotten, underreported or reshared.",
      "BleepingComputer, a cybersecurity site that reviewed the archive, confirmed the data appears to be aggregated from older breaches rather than a fresh incident. This makes the scope of the exposure particularly dangerous because attackers can use this central trove for targeted attacks, including credential stuffing.",
      "Credential stuffing becomes much easier when attackers have access to such a vast pool of usernames and passwords. This technique involves using stolen login details across multiple sites, exploiting the fact that many users reuse the same credentials.

Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager that offers zero-knowledge architecture and military-grade encryption to keep your data safe. The best options work across all your devices and browsers, offer secure sharing, monitor for data breaches, and even generate health reports on your passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking, and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails, and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats, or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0 Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: The massive leak of 16 billion credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number, or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites. While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today\u2019s threat landscape.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "How BeBot works: Tech specs and core features",
      "BeBot operates entirely on electric power, relying on batteries and, in some versions, solar panels. This approach ensures there are no emissions, so the robot does not contribute to greenhouse gases or other forms of pollution. Unlike traditional gas-powered beach-cleaning equipment such as tractors, BeBot is quiet and unobtrusive, which allows it to work at any time without disturbing wildlife or beach visitors. Its cleaning capacity is impressive. BeBot can cover up to 32,200 square feet of beach in a single hour, which is 20 to 30 times more effective than manual trash collection. The robot can remove up to 200 pounds of debris in one session, targeting items like plastic bottles, cigarette butts, food packaging, and cotton buds. BeBot's design allows it to dig up to about four inches into the sand, and its sifting grids, which measure roughly half an inch by half an inch, capture even the smallest pieces of plastic and trash that would be difficult for people to collect by hand.",
      "Remote operation is another standout feature. BeBot can be controlled from up to 950 feet away, giving operators the flexibility to clean large or crowded beaches safely. Its unique track system distributes pressure evenly across the sand, which helps prevent beach erosion and protects sensitive habitats such as turtle nesting sites. The robot's battery can last up to three hours on a full charge, and some models can run for as long as eight hours.",

    "story": [
      "Hackers are using Captchas to infect your PC with malware",
      "ClickFix, a social engineering tactic that has been targeting both Windows and Mac users since early 2024, continues to evolve.",
      "Just last month, I reported on how attackers were using fake CAPTCHA prompts to\u00a0trick Windows users into installing malware themselves.",
      "Now, that same trick is being turned against macOS. Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new campaign using ClickFix to deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), a powerful information-stealing malware targeting Apple systems.",
      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES, AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ClickFix malware, and how does it work?",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0CloudSEK have identified a new threat targeting macOS users through imitation and deception. The campaign uses a technique known as ClickFix to lure victims through fake online verification prompts. This time, attackers are spoofing Spectrum, a major telecom provider in the United States. They use fraudulent domains that closely resemble Spectrum\u2019s real support portals. These include misleading addresses like panel spectrum net and spectrum ticket net.",
      "Visitors to these sites are shown a standard-looking CAPTCHA box, asking them to verify their identity. When they do, the site displays a fake error message that says the CAPTCHA failed. Users are encouraged to click a button labeled \"Alternative Verification.\" This triggers a command to be copied silently to their clipboard. What happens next depends on the user\u2019s operating system. On macOS, instructions guide the user to paste and run the command in Terminal. That command is actually a shell script designed to steal information and download malware.",
      "The script is particularly dangerous because it uses legitimate macOS system commands. It asks for the system password, harvests credentials and disables security protections. It then downloads AMOS. This is a known information stealer with a history of targeting Apple devices. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords, cryptocurrency wallet keys, browser autofill data and saved cookies.",
      "Researchers believe the campaign was created by Russian-speaking attackers. Clues include comments written in Russian found within the malware\u2019s code. Analysts also noted that the delivery infrastructure was poorly assembled. Mismatched instructions appeared across devices. For example, Linux users were shown Windows commands. Mac users were told to press keys that only exist on Windows machines.",

      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Why ClickFix attacks are so effective",
      "ClickFix is a social engineering method that has rapidly gained popularity among cybercriminals. It relies on users trusting what they see and blindly following simple instructions. In this campaign, the attacker\u2019s goal is to make the victim execute the infection process themselves. Once the user follows through, the system is compromised without needing a traditional exploit.",
      "Researchers believe ClickFix has been active since at least March 2024. I first reported on it in June 2024, when\u00a0attackers used fake error messages from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to push their payloads. Victims were shown prompts offering a \"fix,\" which copied a malicious PowerShell command to their clipboard. They were then instructed to paste and run it in PowerShell or through the Run dialog.",
      "By November 2024, the method had evolved further. A\u00a0new wave of attacks targeted Google Meet users, beginning with phishing emails that mimicked internal meeting invites. These emails contained links that redirected to fake Meet landing pages designed to look like they came from the victim\u2019s own organization.",

      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks also start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser, and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email, or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets, or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

The attack didn't just exploit a vulnerability in macOS, but also your familiarity with verification flows. As long as security instructions look like part of the usual experience, people will continue to run malicious code themselves. Mac users, like everyone else, need to treat every familiar-looking interface with a little more skepticism. Especially when it asks for your password.",

Many policymakers are cautious, arguing that current oversight and laws have not yet adapted to the fast-moving landscape of vehicle automation.",
      "Labor organizations, particularly the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have voiced strong opposition. They warn that the widespread adoption of autonomous trucks could displace tens of thousands of human drivers and impact job security across the freight industry. These groups are pushing for more transparency, safety assurances, and legal protections for workers as automation expands. In a public statement opposing the rapid rollout of autonomous trucks, Sean M. O'Brien, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said this:",
      "\"We are not going to sit back and watch as automation threatens the livelihood of millions of truck drivers across America.\"",
      "This quote underscores the growing tension between innovation and labor rights. For many in the workforce, autonomous trucking is seen less as a technological leap forward and more as a potential disruption to long-standing jobs and livelihoods.",
      "Even within the logistics industry itself, some operators remain skeptical about the pace of adoption. Questions remain about how autonomous systems will handle unpredictable real-world conditions such as bad weather, complex intersections, and rural roadways where sensor performance can vary.",
      "In response, Plus emphasizes its phased approach to automation. Rather than replacing drivers overnight, the company positions its SuperDrive system as a way to augment human capabilities, improve safety, and reduce fatigue. Its deep partnerships with trusted manufacturers and logistics providers are also aimed at easing the transition and building confidence across the industry.",
      "As Plus prepares to go public, how it addresses these concerns from regulators, workers, and industry stakeholders will be critical. Earning trust may prove just as important as advancing the technology itself.",

      "Self-driving truck\u00a0 (Plus Automation)",
      "The long road to autonomous safety",
      "According to Linda Garner-Bunch, managing editor of The\u00a0Trucker Media Group:",
      "\"The idea of developing viable \u2014 and safe \u2014 autonomous Class 8 trucks has been around since the 1990s, with lots of tech firms tossing their hats in the ring. Many of those firms have failed, often because of a lack of funding. In addition, both the general public and the trucking industry have expressed concerns about the safety of current autonomous technology. After all, an 80,000-pound driverless truck can do a lot more damage than a 6,000-pound passenger car if something goes wrong!",
      "To address this, legislation has been introduced requiring that a qualified human operator be present in autonomous heavy-duty trucks to take over manual control as needed. Even so, autonomous tech is becoming increasingly common in both commercial and private vehicles \u2014 think anti-lock brakes, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane assist, camera systems \u2026 the list goes on and on.",
      "Autonomy may be the future of the trucking industry, but it\u2019s not ready for full deployment at this time. Adequate funding is needed to ensure that the development and testing of autonomous technology is done properly and safely. The merger between Plus and Churchill Capital Corp IX will help ensure the company has the necessary capital to conduct research, development, and testing while ensuring the safety of everyone on the road.\"",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking might still sound futuristic to some, but companies like Plus Automation are proving it's already becoming a reality. With real-world testing, major industry partnerships, and a smart approach to scaling, Plus is putting itself in a strong position to lead this next chapter in logistics. That said, the journey won't be without its challenges. From regulatory roadblocks to concerns about the impact on jobs, there's still a lot to figure out. But if Plus can keep building trust and showing that its tech really does make trucking safer and more efficient, it could help reshape how freight moves across the U.S. and beyond.",

Now we have the opportunity to pass a bill that advances all of these priorities and sets our country up for better days ahead,\u201d Thune said on the Senate floor. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard on this, and now it\u2019s time to deliver.\u201d",
      "Republicans are racing to pass the 940-page bill, which was released late Friday. It includes tax cuts, a funding boost for immigration enforcement and Medicaid cuts, among other provisions, by a self-imposed deadline of July 4.",
      "Paul criticized the legislation for adding to the debt, calling it \u201cmuch more of a spending bill than a bill that rectifies the debt problem.\u201d",
      "Tillis, who faces a tough re-election battle next year, has slammed the Medicaid cuts as damaging to his state, saying he \u201ccannot support this bill in its current form.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population.\u201d",
      "Trump attacked Tillis on Truth Social after his vote, saying he planned to meet with potential primary challengers to the GOP senator.",
      "\u201cThom Tillis is making a BIG MISTAKE for America, and the Wonderful People of North Carolina!\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "In separate social media posts, Trump also criticized Paul while offering praise for Johnson, Lee, Lummis and Scott.",
      "Little margin for error",

      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted to begin debate on the bill but told reporters that she would file several amendments and is \u201cleaning against\u201d it on final passage unless it is substantially revised. Among the revisions she wants is to allow taxes on the highest earners to go up, a proposal her GOP Senate colleagues are guaranteed to reject.",
      "The legislation would extend the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017 and slash taxes on tips and overtime pay. It includes a $150 billion boost to military spending this year, along with a surge of federal money to carry out Trump\u2019s mass deportations and immigration enforcement agenda. It would partly pay for that with cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and clean energy funding.",
      "And it includes a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling ahead of an August deadline to avert a default on the country\u2019s obligations.",
      "The GOP package would also prohibit Medicaid funding for entities that provide abortions, including Planned Parenthood, seeking to make good on a long-standing conservative priority. That pursuit has faced opposition in the past from Collins and Murkowski, though it\u2019s unclear it will stop them from backing it this time. Their offices didn\u2019t reply to messages seeking comment.",

      "Republicans are seeking to pass the bill through the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to bypass the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold as long as certain parameters are met. The House, which passed its own version in May, also needs to pass the Senate bill before it heads to Trump\u2019s desk; Republicans similarly can only afford three defections.",
      "Trump, who changed his plans and stayed in Washington this weekend, has already been heavily engaged in the whip effort. He has been calling senators and hosting some for meetings at the White House. On Saturday, he golfed with Paul and Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., at his golf club in Virginia.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s me, Trump and Rand Paul. No casualties. We beat the evil duo of Eric Schmitt and [CIA Director] John Ratcliffe. It was a big upset,\u201d Graham joked, describing the golf outing. \u201cTrump played really well on the back, but there\u2019s a bonding experience from playing golf.\u201d",
      "The Senate legislation seeks to resolve a standoff over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. It would lift an existing $10,000 cap to $40,000 for five years \u2014 down from a decade in the House-passed version \u2014 before lowering it back to $10,000, a significant concession for blue-state House Republicans who had insisted on solidifying the higher cap.",

      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he\u2019s \u201cgoing to vote yes on this bill\u201d after some last-minute changes to the Medicaid provider tax that he said would be good for Missouri. Still, he said he has reservations.",
      "\u201cThis has been an unhappy episode here in Congress, this effort to cut Medicaid. And I think, frankly, my party needs to do some soul-searching. If you want to be a working-class party, you\u2019ve got to deliver for working-class people,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cYou cannot take away health care from working people. And unless this is changed going forward, that is what will happen in coming years. So I\u2019m going to do everything I can to stop that.\u201d"

      "The surprise decision opens up seat in battleground North Carolina that was already set to be one of the most hotly contested races of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Tillis issued a lengthy statement about his decision, saying he had not been enthusiastic about seeking a third six-year term in the Senate.",
      "\u201cAs many of my colleagues have noticed over the last year, and at times even joked about, I haven\u2019t exactly been excited about running for another term,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cThat is true since the choice is between spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with the love of my life Susan, our two children, three beautiful grandchildren, and the rest of our extended family back home. It\u2019s not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking re-election.\u201d",
      "After Tillis voted against advancing the GOP\u2019s massive domestic policy bill Saturday, Trump attacked him in a series of social media posts and threatened to meet with potential primary challengers.",

He said that he did not read any of Trump's critical posts of him on Truth Social, including the president's pledge to meet with people who launch primary challenges against Tillis.",
      "\u201cI told him, actually, via text that he probably needed to start looking for a replacement anyway, before he posted that. So I appreciate him getting to work,\" Tillis said, adding that he wants to help Trump find a good candidate to ensure \"a successful 2026.\"",
      "In his statement, Tillis compared himself to former Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona \u2014 both of whom became independents by the end of their tenures \u2014 without explicitly naming them.",
      "\u201cDemocrats recently lost two such leaders who were dedicated to making the Senate more of a functional and productive legislative body. They got things done. But they were shunned after they courageously refused to cave to their party bosses to nuke the filibuster for the sake of political expediency. They ultimately retired and their presence in the Senate chamber has been sorely missed every day since,\u201d Tillis said.",
      "\u201cIt underscores the greatest form of hypocrisy in American politics. When people see independent thinking on the other side, they cheer. But when those very same people see independent thinking coming from their side, they scorn, ostracize, and even censure them,\u201d he continued.",
      "Asked Sunday whether there's room to disagree with Trump in the Republican party, Tillis said \"if you have the courage to.\"",

      "\"Now, Republicans are about to make a mistake on health care and betraying a promise,\" Tillis said. \"It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made in the Oval Office or in the Cabinet room when I was there [with the Finance Committee], when he said we can go after waste, fraud and abuse on any programs.\"",

      "Another potential contender, according to a GOP strategist familiar with the matter, is Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., who has aligned himself closely with Trump. But his role as chair of House Republicans' campaign arm could complicate a Senate bid, and it\u2019s unclear whether if he would need to step down from his leadership post to run.",
      "A source close to Rep. Pat Harrigan, R-N.C. said the congressman is looking at the seat. RNC Chairman Mike Whatley, who formerly chaired the North Carolina GOP, is also seen as a potential candidate.",
      "National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott expressed confidence the party would be able to defend the seat without Tillis in the race.",

      "The Palm Beach Post reported Sunday that Federal Aviation Administration data indicated that Trump would be in South Florida for the opening. Two White House officials and a Florida official familiar with the travel confirmed to NBC News that Trump is \u201clikely\u201d to be there.",
      "The facility is on a little-used airstrip in Miami-Dade County that Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 administration seized using emergency powers to build a housing facility for undocumented migrants. DeSantis issued an emergency order focused on immigration in early 2023, and he has since then extended it multiple times. The measure gives him significant authority to take actions such as seizing land. Some local political leaders in Miami-Dade County opposed DeSantis\u2019 taking the land for the Everglades-based detention center.",
      "The facility, which was set up quickly \u2014 in roughly one week \u2014 by the DeSantis administration, was the brainchild of state Attorney General James Uthmeier, who is DeSantis\u2019 former chief of staff and one of his top political advisers.",
      "Environmental groups sued to block the plan Friday, arguing it could have devastating effects on the Everglades.",
      "\u201cThe site is more than 96% wetlands, surrounded by Big Cypress National Preserve, and is habitat for the endangered Florida panther and other iconic species,\u201d Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Florida Everglades, which is among the groups suing, said in a statement. \u201cThis scheme is not only cruel, it threatens the Everglades ecosystem that state and federal taxpayers have spent billions to protect.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of people also turned out Saturday for a protest against construction of the facility, which is expected to have 5,000 immigrant detention beds.",
      "\"Alligator Alcatraz\" has been hyped as the highest-profile example of Florida's push to be the state that most aggressively tries to align with Trump's immigration agenda.",
      "The facility is estimated to cost $450 million annually, and it has been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, which has said it is likely to reimburse the state for at least some costs associated with operation.",
      "The facility has received significant national attention, resulting in a media and political boon for Uthmeier and DeSantis, who on Friday gave a tour of the facility to Fox News.",
      "Beyond the significant national media attention, political fundraising is up for both Uthmeier and the Republican Party of Florida, which has started selling branded merchandise off the idea, NBC News reported Saturday."

      "The first payments from Canada\u2019s digital services tax, which was enacted last year and applies retroactively to 2022, were initially set to be collected Monday.

      "However, the statement from Canada\u2019s finance ministry also said that Carney \u201chas been clear that Canada will take as long as necessary, but no longer, to achieve that deal.\u201d",

      "Ottawa also said that the tax was enacted while it worked with international partners \u2014 including the U.S.\u2014 on a multilateral agreement that would replace national digital services taxes.",
      "Shortly after Trump said that the U.S. was \u201cterminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC\u2019s Morgan Brennan that U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would be investigating the tax to \u201cdetermine the amount of harm to the U.S. companies and the U.S. economy in general.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 President Donald Trump is expected to be at the formal opening Tuesday of a controversial immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades that state leaders have dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz.\u201d",
      "The Palm Beach Post reported Sunday that Federal Aviation Administration data indicated that Trump would be in South Florida for the opening. Two White House officials and a Florida official familiar with the travel confirmed to NBC News that Trump is \u201clikely\u201d to be there.",
      "The facility is on a little-used airstrip in Miami-Dade County that Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 administration seized using emergency powers to build a housing facility for undocumented migrants. DeSantis issued an emergency order focused on immigration in early 2023, and he has since then extended it multiple times. The measure gives him significant authority to take actions such as seizing land. Some local political leaders in Miami-Dade County opposed DeSantis\u2019 taking the land for the Everglades-based detention center.",
      "The facility, which was set up quickly \u2014 in roughly one week \u2014 by the DeSantis administration, was the brainchild of state Attorney General James Uthmeier, who is DeSantis\u2019 former chief of staff and one of his top political advisers.",
      "Environmental groups sued to block the plan Friday, arguing it could have devastating effects on the Everglades.",
      "\u201cThe site is more than 96% wetlands, surrounded by Big Cypress National Preserve, and is habitat for the endangered Florida panther and other iconic species,\u201d Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Florida Everglades, which is among the groups suing, said in a statement. \u201cThis scheme is not only cruel, it threatens the Everglades ecosystem that state and federal taxpayers have spent billions to protect.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of people also turned out Saturday for a protest against construction of the facility, which is expected to have 5,000 immigrant detention beds.",
      "\"Alligator Alcatraz\" has been hyped as the highest-profile example of Florida's push to be the state that most aggressively tries to align with Trump's immigration agenda.",
      "The facility is estimated to cost $450 million annually, and it has been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, which has said it is likely to reimburse the state for at least some costs associated with operation.",
      "The facility has received significant national attention, resulting in a media and political boon for Uthmeier and DeSantis, who on Friday gave a tour of the facility to Fox News.",
      "Beyond the significant national media attention, political fundraising is up for both Uthmeier and the Republican Party of Florida, which has started selling branded merchandise off the idea, NBC News reported Saturday."

      "Following the vote, Trump attacked Tillis for opposing the sweeping domestic policy bill, threatening to meet with potential Republican primary challengers.",

      "The response to Lozano\u2019s arrest highlights a new strategy emerging after large-scale protests overtook downtown Los Angeles earlier this month. Instead of focusing on marches outside federal buildings, residents of sprawling L.A. County are zeroing in on their own blocks and neighborhoods to show their opposition to Trump\u2019s mass deportation efforts.",

      "The constant rumbling of passing dump trucks drowns out the once familiar chirping of birds at the family home of Mae\u2019anna Osceola-Hart in Everglades National Park.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all-day, all-night truck noise,\u201d says the 21-year-old photographer who describes herself as part Miccosukee and part Seminole, two Florida tribes at the heart of the debate over the detention center known as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz.\u201d",
      "The homes of Miccosukee and Seminole people, as well as their ceremonial sites, surround the detention center on three sides.",
      "Osceola-Hart\u2019s great-grandfather Wild Bill Osceola fought against the development of an airport at the same site where the ICE facility\u2019s construction is now underway.",
      "In 1968, authorities in Dade County, now known as Miami-Dade County, began building the Big Cypress Jetport on land the Miccosukees used for ceremonial practices. The Dade County Port Authority referred to the project as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest airport,\u201d with six runways designed to handle large jets, and officials were quoted as calling the environmental and tribal leaders who opposed it \u201cbutterfly chasers.\u201d",
      "The airport became a flashpoint for resistance, but in 1969, a coalition including Osceola-Hart\u2019s great-grandfather, fellow tribesmen and conservationists persuaded Florida Gov. Claude R. Kirk Jr. that the airport would damage the Everglades. He ordered construction be stopped. One runway, approximately 10,000 feet in length, was left behind as a training ground for pilots.",
      "Osceola-Hart is proud of her great-grandfather\u2019s efforts to stop the 1960s development, but she is disappointed the Miccosukees lost land they considered sacred. \u201cWe got kicked out of ceremonial grounds,\u201d she says.",
      "Finding a safe place to live has been an ongoing battle for the tribes in Florida. Seminoles retreated into the Everglades after the Seminole wars ended in 1858.",
      "The Miccosukees found refuge in the Everglades after development in Miami and Fort Lauderdale pushed them out of their settlements. Now, many members of the tribes live on the Big Cypress Reservation or in camps of wooden homes along Tamiami Trail (U.S. Highway 41), a road that slices the Everglades east to west and disrupts the natural flow of water from Lake Okeechobee to the park.",
      "Construction of that road ended in 1928, changing life dramatically in the Everglades. Tourists were able to access remote areas of the lush national park. The tribes developed tourist attractions, like casinos, chickee huts and airboat tours through the mangroves. Native species declined.",
      "Leaders of both tribes are constantly advocating for the preservation of the national park\u2019s wildlife and vegetation, but they don\u2019t have authority over how the land is used.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a long, fraught battle,\u201d says William \u201cPopeye\u201d Osceola, secretary of the Miccosukee Tribe, describing how tribes are constantly fighting for rights over the land they have lived on for more than a century. Before he became the tribe\u2019s secretary (an elected position), Osceola was an art teacher at the Miccosukee Indian School, passing on the tribe\u2019s traditions to his students.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a place where we come for healing, where we come to pray,\u201d says Betty Osceola, a prominent member of the Miccosukee Tribe who is part of the Everglades Advisory Board. Her chickee village is within walking distance of the detention site.",
      "The detention center sits on Miami-Dade County land, but Gov. Ron DeSantis seized it under an emergency order, which does not require county commission approval. Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava cited multiple concerns about the immigrant prison in a letter sent to Tallahassee.",
      "DeSantis has previously said the center \u201chelps fulfill President Trump\u2019s mission\u201d and that it will have \u201czero impact\u201d on the surrounding Everglades area.",
      "William Osceola tells young members of his tribe to stay engaged to protect their rights. \u201cSome of these fights, they come in different forms, but it\u2019s still the same fight.\u201d he said.",
      "Osceola-Hart agrees. \u201cThis is history repeating itself,\u201d she says."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said in an interview on Fox News that the administration is working to develop a temporary pass for immigrants who work in certain industries, which would mark the latest shift in the administration\u2019s approach to immigration enforcement for farmworkers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re working on it right now. We\u2019re going to work it so that some kind of a temporary pass where people pay taxes, where the farmer can have a little control, as opposed to you walk in and take everybody away,\u201d Trump said in an interview that was taped Friday and aired Sunday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d",
      "The president referenced authorities going to farms and taking \u201caway people that have been working there for 15 and 20 years, who are good, who possibly came in incorrectly.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to do something for farmers, where we can let the farmer sort of be in charge. The farmer knows. He\u2019s not going to hire a murderer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you go into a farm and he\u2019s had somebody working with him for nine years doing this kind of work, which is hard work to do, and a lot of people aren\u2019t going to do it, and you end up destroying a farmer because you took all the people away. It\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "Reached for comment, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security provided the same comment the department gave this month after the White House reversed a plan to limit immigration enforcement activity at certain industry workplaces.",
      "\"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE\u2019s efforts,\" the statement read.",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability. These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation,\" the statement continued.",
      "A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for further details about Trump\u2019s plan and whether DHS' response conflicted with the temporary pass plan.",
      "The move marks the latest shift in the administration\u2019s handling of immigrant farmworkers. The White House has waffled in recent weeks about whether to exempt certain worksites from Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.",
      "Trump said on Truth Social on June 12 that farmers and people in the hotel and leisure industries had said the administration\u2019s immigration policy \u201cis taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.\u201d He said that \u201cwe must protect our Farmers,\u201d adding that \u201cchanges are coming.\u201d NBC News has reported that at around the same time, ICE paused worksite arrests in the agriculture, restaurant and hotel industries.",
      "But just days later, the administration reopened arrests of immigrant workers in those industries. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin provided the same statement then as the DHS statement Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE\u2019s efforts,\u201d McLaughlin said after DHS reversed the pause this month.",
      "A White House spokesperson said after the pause reversal that Trump \u201cremains committed to enforcing federal immigration law \u2014 anyone present in the United States illegally is at risk of deportation.\u201d",
      "Trump in April floated the idea that undocumented people working at farms and hotels could be allowed to leave the country and return legally. NBC News has reported that an administration official said Trump wanted to improve H-2A and H-2B programs, which allow employers to temporarily hire migrant workers."

      "\"Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,\" Vylan wrote. \"Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organising online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.\"",

      "And officials at the Israeli Embassy in the U.K. denounced the speech in a statement, saying it \u201ccrosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing.\u201d The embassy wrote that chants like \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d and \u201cFrom the river to the sea\u201d are phrases that \u201cadvocate for the dismantling of the State of Israel and implicitly call for the elimination of Jewish self-determination.\u201d",

      "On Sunday, Mamdani also spoke about his plans to raise taxes on the wealthiest people living in the Big Apple, telling \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker, \u201cUltimately, the reason I want to increase these taxes on the top 1%, the most profitable corporations, is to increase quality of life for everyone, including those who are going to be taxed.\u201d",
      "He credited his plan to raise taxes on the wealthy as one of the key tenets of his platform that helped him win the primary.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that our vision to tax the top 1% of New Yorkers \u2014 these are New Yorkers who make a million dollars a year or more \u2014 and our proposal is to just tax them by 2% additional, is something that has broad support, and we\u2019ll continue to increase that support over the next few months.\u201d",
      "Mamdani has also faced critics \u2014 including President Donald Trump \u2014 who call him a communist.",
      "\u201cI am not\u201d a communist, Mamdani said on Sunday, in response to a question about Trump\u2019s comments.",
      "On Sunday, in a separate interview on Fox News that was taped Friday, Trump again spoke about Mamdani, making a threat to pull federal funding from New York City if the next mayor doesn\u2019t \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut let\u2019s say this: If he does get in, I\u2019m going to be president, and he\u2019s going to have to do the right thing or they\u2019re not getting any money, he\u2019s got to do the right thing,\u201d the president told Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo.",
      "Mamdani added in his response: \u201cI have already had to start to get used to, get used to the fact that the president will talk about how I look, how I sound, where I\u2019m from, who I am, ultimately, because he wants to distract from what I\u2019m fighting for, and I\u2019m fighting for the very working people that he ran a campaign to empower, that he has since then betrayed.\u201d",
      "A key focus of Mamdani\u2019s campaign was speaking about affordability and the economy, a point that he made on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday when asked about why he thought he won.",
      "\u201cIt was the focus on the fact that we live in the most expensive city in the United States of America. It\u2019s also the wealthiest city in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and yet 1 in 4 New Yorkers are living in poverty, and the rest are seemingly trapped in a state of anxiety,\u201d Mamdani said.",
      "He added, \u201cAnd what we\u2019ve seen is that this is a city that needs to be affordable for the people who build it every day. Our focus was on exactly that, and by keeping that focus on an economic agenda, we showed New Yorkers that this could be more than just a museum of what once was. It could be a living, breathing testament to possibility.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Former University of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh was named in an ongoing class-action suit against the school over allegations that a former offensive coordinator illegally accessed student accounts to download their personal, intimate images.",
      "Harbaugh, now head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, led the Wolverines from 2015 to 2023. Co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss was hired at the University of Michigan in 2021 and terminated in 2023 for allegedly gaining unauthorized access to other people\u2019s computer accounts.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan charged Weiss in March with 14 counts of unauthorized access to computers and 10 counts of aggravated identity theft. According to a federal indictment, he had unauthorized access to a platform with personal identifying information about student-athletes from more than 100 colleges and universities across the country.",
      "He then allegedly used that information to hack into the personal accounts of 3,300 students and alumni with the help of additional internet research. Federal prosecutors allege that he mostly targeted female student-athletes, downloading intimate photos and videos from their private accounts.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "The class-action lawsuit, which is separate from the criminal case, targets Weiss, the University of Michigan and the maker of third-party software Weiss is alleged to have used to gain access to personal identifying information of student-athletes. It consolidates a number of civil suits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.",
      "Harbaugh was named as a party in an amended complaint Friday, alleging that he neglected responsibilities in his role as Weiss\u2019 supervisor and the head of the football program.",
      "The complaint alleges that Harbaugh \u201cfailed and refused to implement basic security measures to Weiss and the football program\u201d that resulted in Weiss being able to gain access to the students\u2019 information.",
      "\u201cHad Harbaugh implemented basic oversight of his staff, Plaintiffs and the class would have been protected against predators such as Weiss,\u201d the complaint said.",
      "The new complaint also alleges that a staff member saw Weiss viewing a student\u2019s private information at Schembechler Hall in December 2022 prior to the school competing in the Fiesta Bowl.",
      "Harbaugh and the university allowed Weiss to participate in the game, despite a report having been filed to the university prior to the game, the filing said.",
      "A representative for Harbaugh did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Harbaugh said this year after Weiss' indictment that he was \u201ccompletely shocked\u201d and \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the allegations, according to NBC Sports.",
      "The two worked together prior to their time at the University of Michigan when Harbaugh coached at Stanford University between 2007 and 2010.",
      "Weiss also worked with Harbaugh\u2019s brother, John Harbaugh,  on the Baltimore Ravens staff. Weiss spent 12 seasons as an assistant coach for the Ravens where, Harbaugh\u2019s brother served as head coach."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., announced Sunday that he would not run for re-election, one day after he drew President Donald Trump\u2019s ire for opposing the party\u2019s sweeping domestic policy package.",
      "The surprise decision opens up seat in battleground North Carolina that was already set to be one of the most hotly contested races of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Tillis issued a lengthy statement about his decision, saying he had not been enthusiastic about seeking a third six-year term in the Senate.",
      "\u201cAs many of my colleagues have noticed over the last year, and at times even joked about, I haven\u2019t exactly been excited about running for another term,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cThat is true since the choice is between spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with the love of my life Susan, our two children, three beautiful grandchildren, and the rest of our extended family back home. It\u2019s not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking re-election.\u201d",
      "After Tillis voted against advancing the GOP\u2019s massive domestic policy bill Saturday, Trump attacked him in a series of social media posts and threatened to meet with potential primary challengers.",
      "\u201cThom Tillis is making a BIG MISTAKE for America, and the Wonderful People of North Carolina!\u201d Trump wrote Saturday night on Truth Social.",
      "Tillis told reporters Sunday that he informed both Trump and Senate Majority Leader John Thune of his decision to forgo re-election Saturday night. He said that he did not read any of Trump's critical posts of him on Truth Social, including the president's pledge to meet with people who launch primary challenges against Tillis.",
      "\u201cI told him, actually, via text that he probably needed to start looking for a replacement anyway, before he posted that. So I appreciate him getting to work,\" Tillis said, adding that he wants to help Trump find a good candidate to ensure \"a successful 2026.\"",
      "In his statement, Tillis compared himself to former Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona \u2014 both of whom became independents by the end of their tenures \u2014 without explicitly naming them.",
      "\u201cDemocrats recently lost two such leaders who were dedicated to making the Senate more of a functional and productive legislative body. They got things done. But they were shunned after they courageously refused to cave to their party bosses to nuke the filibuster for the sake of political expediency. They ultimately retired and their presence in the Senate chamber has been sorely missed every day since,\u201d Tillis said.",
      "\u201cIt underscores the greatest form of hypocrisy in American politics. When people see independent thinking on the other side, they cheer. But when those very same people see independent thinking coming from their side, they scorn, ostracize, and even censure them,\u201d he continued.",
      "Asked Sunday whether there's room to disagree with Trump in the Republican party, Tillis said \"if you have the courage to.\"",
      "\"If you don\u2019t, there isn\u2019t. It\u2019s all what you want to do as an individual member,\" he said.",
      "Prior to Saturday's vote, Tillis had privately warned his colleagues that the Medicaid cuts in the party's \"big, beautiful bill\" would cost them politically.",
      "During a floor debate over the bill Sunday, Tillis said the health care cuts in the funding package amount to a betrayal of the American people, particularly after Trump urged lawmakers to target only waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid and other entitlement programs.",
      "\"Now, Republicans are about to make a mistake on health care and betraying a promise,\" Tillis said. \"It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made in the Oval Office or in the Cabinet room when I was there [with the Finance Committee], when he said we can go after waste, fraud and abuse on any programs.\"",
      "Republicans are now forced to scramble to find a replacement for Tillis in a race that is a top target for Democrats in next year's midterms.",
      "A source close to the Trump family said Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law and former Republican National Committee co-chair, is \"strongly considering\" jumping into the contest.",
      "Asked about the odds she will run, the source said, \u201cI\u2019d put it as high as one could be considering it.\u201d",
      "Another potential contender, according to a GOP strategist familiar with the matter, is Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., who has aligned himself closely with Trump. But his role as chair of House Republicans' campaign arm could complicate a Senate bid, and it\u2019s unclear whether if he would need to step down from his leadership post to run.",
      "A source close to Rep. Pat Harrigan, R-N.C. said the congressman is looking at the seat. RNC Chairman Mike Whatley, who formerly chaired the North Carolina GOP, is also seen as a potential candidate.",
      "National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott expressed confidence the party would be able to defend the seat without Tillis in the race.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has won North Carolina three times, and the state\u2019s been represented by two Republican Senators for over a decade,\u201d Scott, R-S.C., said in a statement. \u201cThat streak will continue in 2026 when North Carolinians elect a conservative leader committed to advancing an agenda of opportunity, prosperity, and security.\u201d",
      "But Democrats are now even more optimistic about their chances in North Carolina next year as they seek to cut into the GOP\u2019s 53-47 majority.",
      "\u201cThom Tillis\u2019 decision not to run for reelection is another blow to Republicans\u2019 chances as they face a midterm backlash that puts their majority at risk,\u201d Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle said in a statement. \u201cEven Tillis admits the GOP plan to slash Medicaid and spike costs for families is toxic \u2014 and in 2026, Democrats will flip North Carolina\u2019s Senate seat.\u201d",
      "Democrats are hopeful they can recruit former Gov. Roy Cooper to enter the contest, which already features former Rep. Wiley Nickel, D-N.C.",
      "\u201cNo matter which MAGA loyalist Donald Trump hand-picks to run in North Carolina, I\u2019m the Democrat who\u2019s ready to take them on and win,\u201d Nickel said in a statement Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve flipped a tough seat before and we\u2019re going to do it again.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A T-shirt worn by Beyonc\u00e9 during a Juneteenth performance on her \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d tour has sparked a discussion over how Americans frame their history and caused a wave of criticism for the Houston-born superstar.",
      "The T-shirt worn during a concert in Paris featured images of the Buffalo Soldiers, who belonged to Black U.S. Army units active during the late 1800s and early 1900s. On the back was a lengthy description of the soldiers that included \u201ctheir antagonists were the enemies of peace, order and settlement: warring Indians, bandits, cattle thieves, murderous gunmen, bootleggers, trespassers, and Mexican revolutionaries.\u201d",
      "Images of the shirt and videos of the performance are also featured on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s website.",
      "As she prepares to return to the U.S. for performances in her hometown this weekend, fans and Indigenous influencers took to social media to criticize Beyonc\u00e9 for wearing a shirt that frames Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries as anything but the victims of American imperialism and for promoting anti-Indigenous language.",
      "A spokesperson for Beyonc\u00e9 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Who were the Buffalo Soldiers?",
      "The Buffalo Soldiers served in six military units created after the Civil War in 1866. They were comprised of formerly enslaved men, freemen, and Black Civil War soldiers and fought in hundreds of conflicts \u2014 including in the Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II \u2014 until they were disbanded in 1951.",
      "As the quote on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s shirt notes, they also fought numerous battles against Indigenous peoples as part of the U.S. Army\u2019s campaign of violence and land theft during the country\u2019s westward expansion.",
      "Some historians say the moniker \u201cBuffalo Soldiers\u201d was bestowed by the tribes who admired the bravery and tenacity of the fighters, but that might be more legend than fact. \u201cAt the end of the day, we really don\u2019t have that kind of information,\u201d said Cale Carter, director of exhibitions at the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Houston.",
      "Carter and other museum staff said that, only in the past few years, the museum made broader efforts to include more of the complexities of the battles the Buffalo Soldiers fought against Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries and the role they played in the subjugation of Indigenous peoples. They, much like many other museums across the country, are hoping to add more nuance to the framing of American history and be more respectful of the ways they have caused harm to Indigenous communities.",
      "\u201cWe romanticize the Western frontier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe early stories that talked about the Buffalo Soldiers were impacted by a lot of those factors. So you really didn\u2019t see a changing in that narrative until recently.\u201d",
      "There has often been a lack of diverse voices discussing how the history of the Buffalo Soldiers is framed, said Michelle Tovar, the museum\u2019s director of education. The current political climate has put enormous pressure on schools, including those in Texas, to avoid honest discussions about American history, she said.",
      "\u201cRight now, in this area, we are getting pushback from a lot of school districts in which we can\u2019t go and teach this history,\u201d Tovar said. \u201cWe are a museum where we can at least be a hub, where we can invite the community regardless of what districts say, invite them to learn it and do what we can do the outreach to continue to teach honest history.\u201d",
      "Historians scrutinize reclamation motive",
      "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s recent album \u201cAct II: Cowboy Carter\u201d has played on a kind of American iconography, which many see as her way of subverting the country music genre\u2019s adjacency to whiteness and reclaiming the cowboy aesthetic for Black Americans. Last year, she became the first Black woman ever to top Billboard\u2019s country music chart, and \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d won her the top prize at the 2025 Grammy Awards, album of the year.",
      "\u201cThe Buffalo Soldiers play this major role in the Black ownership of the American West,\u201d said Tad Stoermer, a historian and professor at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIn my view, (Beyonc\u00e9 is) well aware of the role that these images play. This is the \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 tour for crying out loud. The entire tour, the entire album, the entire piece is situated in this layered narrative.\u201d",
      "But Stoermer also points out that the Buffalo Soldiers have been framed in the American story in a way that also plays into the myths of American nationalism.",
      "As Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of Buffalo Soldiers imagery implies, Black Americans also use their story to claim agency over their role in the creation of the country, said Alaina E. Roberts, a historian, author and professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studies the intersection of Black and Native American life from the Civil War to present day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the category in which she thought maybe she was coming into this conversation, but the Buffalo Soldiers are even a step above that because they were literally involved in not just the settlement of the West but of genocide in a sense,\u201d she said.",
      "Online backlash builds ahead of Houston shows",
      "Several Native influencers, performers, and academics took to social media this week to criticize Beyonc\u00e9 or decry the shirt\u2019s language as anti-Indigenous. \u201cDo you think Beyonc\u00e9 will apologize (or acknowledge) the shirt?\u201d indigenous.tv, an Indigenous news and culture Instagram account with more than 130,000 followers, asked in a post Thursday.",
      "Many of her critics, as well as fans, agree. A flood of social media posts called out the pop star for the historic framing on the shirt.",
      "\u201cThe Buffalo Soldiers are an interesting historical moment to look at. But we have to be honest about what they did, especially in their operations against Indigenous Americans and Mexicans,\u201d said Chisom Okorafor, who posts on TikTok under the handle @confirmedsomaya.",
      "Okorafor said there is no \u201cprogressive\u201d way to reclaim America\u2019s history of empire building in the West, and that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of Western symbolism sends a problematic message: \u201cThat Black people, too, can engage in American nationalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack people, too, can profit from the atrocities of (the) American empire,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a message that tells you to abandon immigrants, Indigenous people, and people who live outside of the United States. It is a message that tells you not only is it a virtue to have been born in this country, but the longer your line extends in this country, the more virtuous you are.\u201d"

    "summary": "The stars of the new \"F1\" movie explain to TODAY.com how they filmed amid real-life Formula One races and how Brad Pitt and Damson Idris drove at 180 mph.",
    "story": [
      "In the new \u201cF1\u201d movie, the race cars reach real-life speeds of 180 mph. But who\u2019s behind the wheel?",
      "The film\u2019s producer, Oscar-winning producer Jerry Bruckheimer, tells TODAY.com \u201cF1\u201d stars Brad Pitt and Damson Idris were authentically racing.",
      "\u201cDamson Idris, who\u2019s a rising young star, had to drive in these cars and train for three months, just like Brad (Pitt) did,\u201d Bruckheimer says. \u201cBut the brutality of what you go through in these cars that are going 180 miles an hour \u2014 they have to break down to 50. They\u2019re taking 5 Gs in the corners. It is brutal.\u201d",
      "When recalling the experience of racing at such high speeds, Idris explains to TODAY.com the difficulty of the \u201cintricate turnings and just the Gs that you\u2019re hitting, and just the way the car sticks as you\u2019re turning.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t explain it. You have to be in it to feel it, you know? But the brilliance of this movie is, through watching it, you feel like you\u2019re in a car,\u201d he says of the action flick, which premiered June 27 in IMAX.",
      "Driving on Real-Life Racetracks During Real-Life Races",
      "As part of maintaining the authenticity of Formula One in the film, shooting occurred on actual racetracks around the world \u2014 sometimes during real-time F1 races.",
      "Bruckheimer explains that F1 races are held at 22 different tracks globally, and the movie shot at nine of them since the plot follows the drivers during the last nine races of the season.",
      "In order to shoot during the competitions, Bruckheimer says the film crew \u201chad track time at every race.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn other words, we get three (to) five minutes in between qualifying or in between practice,\u201d he shares.",
      "\u201cWhat was exciting for our actors is, first of all, they\u2019re driving these cars at high speeds in front of 140,000 people and 10 million people, 100 million people,\u201d Bruckheimer continues, adding that the actors were required to drive and break at high speeds while \u201cremembering your lines at the same time.\u201d",
      "Bruckheimer compares the takes during real races to \u201clive theater.\u201d",
      "Kerry Condon, who plays Kate McKenna in the movie, tells TODAY.com she was ready for the fast-paced filming when she agreed to take on the role.",
      "\u201cJoe (Kosinski) told me, when I got the job, \u2018There\u2019s going to be a live aspect, so you\u2019re not going to get a lot of takes. And also, with that, there\u2019s not going to be makeup checks all the time. Once you\u2019re on that pit wall, we\u2019re done. There\u2019s no bathroom breaks,\u2019\u201d she recalls, adding, \u201cSo I loved that, personally.\u201d",
      "As for Idris, who plays F1 driver Joshua Pearce in the movie, he jokes about the high-stakes takes, \u201cI just said, \u2018If anything goes wrong, I\u2019m going to pretend it\u2019s Brad that\u2019s driving.\u2019\u201d",
      "With a slightly more serious tone, he then describes the filming process as \u201cexhilarating\u201d while crediting the \u201cF1\u201d creative team for making them feel \u201coverprepared\u201d going into the quick takes.",
      "\u201cOf course, naturally, things could go wrong. We had one of the most famous human beings on the planet or universe in our movie,\u201d Idris says, referring to Pitt. \u201cSo we\u2019d be doing scenes on the track and people (were) running up with selfies. So that was always an added pressure.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut that pressure, we reveled in it,\u201d he adds.",
      "Javier Bardem, who plays Ruben Cervantes, points out Idris and Pitt likely felt more pressure filming during the live races in front of hundreds of thousands of people. But he says the crew\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d wasn\u2019t lost on him.",
      "\u201cBeing part of the scenes with the driver, and being part of what it means to be a team, and the whole structure of what it takes to put those drivers on the track, it\u2019s so much work,\u201d Bardem tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very admirable to see the effort that it takes for so many people to make that car ready to go that speed.\u201d"

      "When asked about being labeled the \u201cgirlfriend of\u201d a celebrity, she replied, \u201cAs soon as you\u2019re in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become \u2018girlfriend of\u2019\u2014or \u2018boyfriend of,\u2019 for that matter. And that can be extremely annoying. Suddenly, people are talking about you as so-and-so\u2019s girlfriend who was so-and-so\u2019s ex.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cSo it\u2019s not nice to think that you can\u2019t love whoever you want, because of the labels people need to stick on you.\u201d",
      "Ceretti and DiCaprio joined other famous faces like Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Orlando Bloom, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brady and more who watched S\u00e1nchez wed Bezos in a unique Dolce & Gabbana wedding gown.",
      "Following the nuptials, the couple held a pajama-themed party with their guests."

    "summary": "Queer love stories are as iconic as the LGBTQ+ community that it centers on. To highlight some of these stories, TODAY.com has compiled a list of 25 queer romance films to watch.",
    "story": [
      "Queer love stories have stood the test of time as filmmakers strive to tell authentic narratives, despite LGBTQ+ representation in films facing challenges throughout history.",
      "Films showcasing love in the LGBTQ+ community have been around for more than a century. Over time, they've become an important form of queer representation, helping to counter stereotypes and combat negative tropes in media.",
      "But, getting to this level of representation wasn\u2019t easy. While films depicting queer love were not formally banned, the Hays Code, also known as the Motion Picture Production Code, had Hollywood studios self-enforce a set of guidelines from around 1934 to 1968 to prevent government interference. Centered around \"moral standards\" and social values, the guidelines purported to ensure movies presented viewers with \"correct standards of life\" by banning profanity, obscenity and graphic violence. It also prevented overt or positive portrayals of LGBTQ+ relationships, according to a library guide from Ithaca College.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until the 1960s that the Hays Code was effectively challenged. The organization now known as the Motion Picture Association (MPA) established a film content rating system in 1968 which served as the code\u2019s replacement.",
      "Though it\u2019s been over 50 years since the Hays Code, and much progress has been made for LGBTQ+ representation in cinema, there still remain ongoing challenges for accurate and authentic narratives. The queer community continues to navigate a fickle film industry that periodically offers room for diverse storytelling, but can miss the mark with film tropes like the \u201cgay best friend,\u201d the \u201ccloseted bully\" or \"bury your gays,\" referring to a pattern of queer characters being killed off in shows and movies.",
      "Carlos King, CEO of Kingdom Reign Entertainment and a TV industry creative, tells TODAY.com that it\u2019s important to have authentic queer stories on screen so viewers can move past stereotypes and caricatures.",
      "\u201cI want to see (movies) starring queer people, not as being the sidekick to the main cast member or being the glam squad that we just see on television,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are leading. We have leading roles in our personal lives. We are executives. We\u2019re a vice president, presidents, CEOs of multiple companies.\u201d",
      "King says he strives to bring the representation \u2014 including that of love in the LGBTQ+ community \u2014\u00a0that he didn't have growing up to the screen.",
      "\u201cBeing a young gay Black boy from Detroit, Michigan, one of 10 siblings, I know all about desiring to look at a television screen and wanting to see someone like you reflected back,\" he says.",
      "Filmmaker Elegance Bratton, whose 2022 autobiographical breakout military drama, \u201cThe Inspection,\u201d received rave reviews from critics, tells TODAY.com that showing queer romance on screen helps to combat the negativity often felt in society.",
      "\u201cShowing love is always a good thing. We live in a world where hatred of queer people is reaching a fever point,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe need to see queer people loving on each other because it\u2019s real. We do love and that spirit is indomitable.\u201d",
      "Andrea Ambam, director of programming at Level Forward, a public benefit entertainment company, agrees, telling TODAY.com that seeing these stories on the big screen can help members of the LGBTQ+ community feel seen.",
      "\u201cI know and believe that queer films are important because of the way they\u2019re able to reach us through the screen,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way they\u2019re able to find, often, young people who may or may not be questioning their belonging in their homes, in their schools, in their communities, and they reach across the screen and say, \u2018You belong. You are here. There are more people like you.\u2019\u201d"

      "Typically wearing leisurewear, the Canadian radio show host looks into a camera in the soundproof studio she created in her basement. With a microphone propped in front of her, she records poems \u2014 ones she's written that cover complicated topics like friendships, broken hearts, body insecurities, aging and grief.",
      "And these poems have now been watched over 100 million times on TikTok alone (yes, we counted).",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t remember anyone I\u2019ve ever seen at a public pool with such a memorable body, good or bad, that I think about it ever again,\u201d begins what is her most popular poem thus far.",
      "In it, she reflects on all the aspects of a person that only briefly grab her attention \u2014 their body, their looks \u2014 before pivoting to what she does remember.",
      "\u201cWhen I talk about my friends, sometimes I will bother to note that they are beautiful, yes. But I will list the things that make them that way,\u201d she says.",
      "What began as a regulation exercise from her therapist has turned Balka into a viral sensation in late 20223, with the likes of John Mayer, Jennifer Aniston and Mel Robbins sharing her work. And now, with the release of her first book, \"I Hope You Remember,\" Balka can add New York Times bestselling author to her list of accolades. (Her second book, \"Loves of Our Lives,\" will be out January 2026.)",
      "\"It's hard to wrap my head around,\" she tells TODAY.com on the phone as she sat on her porch earlier this month. \"It just doesn't feel real.\"",
      "Balka spoke with TODAY.com about her sudden viral rise, how quickly she can whip up a poem, the themes to which she keeps returning and whether her fianc\u00e9 is terrified about writing his own wedding vows (spoiler alert: he is).",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "The one thing that I worry about the most is the people that I know thinking that it\u2019s not cool. I love that quote that\u2019s like, \"It\u2019s only cringy until it works.\" I feel like at first, I was a little bit more sensitive to any negativity, which there honestly hasn\u2019t been a ton of, which is really nice because I know on the internet when I post other kinds of content, there can be. But usually with poems, it\u2019s pretty positive. Anybody who\u2019s being mean on the internet, I would never admire those people, so I find that I can\u2019t be scared of them either.",
      "I had one go super viral at the end of 2023, the public pool one. And that was kind of the first one that I was like, \u201cWoah, what just happened?\u201d I think as kind of unfortunate as it is, one of the main ways that I want to push forward is when people are encouraging me to do so, and sometimes it does take a little bit of enforcement. And being encouraged by celebrities that I\u2019ve looked up to for a long time, I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. This could be something.\u201d",
      "I believe that I had just gone shopping or was looking at bathing",
      "Some of the most resonating things are the things that I\u2019m sitting here thinking I\u2019m the only one who feels that way.",
      "Josie balka",
      "suits online and I was just thinking about how crappy of an experience that always is for me. And I just have never, ever put any significance into why I love somebody based on their body. I kind of was like, \u201cWhy are you so worried that everyone's looking at you when you\u2019ve never looked at anybody else and remembered them?\u201d",
      "It kind of spiraled into all these other reasons that describe why people care about who you are and not how you look, and different scenarios in your life. I feel like it\u2019s a really important thing to remember.",
      "I lost over 100 pounds, and I have lots of trauma from it. I\u2019ve had a few surgeries for loose skin and that kind of stuff. After my first plastic surgery for my lower body, I got sepsis and almost died. It's crazy that I did this for how I looked, and then I almost died. And it didn\u2019t make me any happier. It just made me feel smaller, and I kind of thought that was the only thing I needed or wanted.",
      "And then there was kind of a big realization when I got to my goal. I still had all these things to work through and my happiness was never really dependent on the way that I looked in the way that I thought. I think there\u2019s a lot of people who sit around saying, \u201cWell, if I just lost 10 pounds \u2026 if I didn\u2019t have this loose skin, my life would be so much better.\u201d But there\u2019s no end goal, you just find something else. The way you look will never be the only thing. And I feel like I\u2019ve learned that firsthand a lot over the last few years.",
      "Some of the most resonating things I find are the things that I\u2019m sitting here thinking I\u2019m the only one who feels that way, because I truly don\u2019t think there are many unique experiences. Often if you just say the one thing that you carry the most shame over out loud, you\u2019ll find 100 other people that feel that way too. That\u2019s kind of why I leaned into it.",
      "It goes both ways.  Every time somebody goes, \"Oh, I really related to this thing, it made me feel less alone,\" I get to be like, \"Oh, because you related to this, now I know that I\u2019m not alone in that thought.\" I hope that other people scrolling through the comment section of a video they resonate with are seeing 100 other people that are like, \"Me too, me too, me too.\" And we can make everyone feel less alone together.",
      "I would have to have more of a routine with it. I usually just write down ideas as they come to me. I'll think of a line while I\u2019m driving or at work and I\u2019ll just type it into my phone. Eventually I\u2019ll scroll through all the one-liners on my notes app and expand on one of them. And if I feel like it\u2019s good enough, I\u2019ll go downstairs in my studio and record and post it. I\u2019d say 99% of the time, I write, record and post all in the same night.",
      "He was not wanting to do vows in front of people. He is very loving and very sweet and he\u2019s not shy to tell me how he feels but he is definitely shy to speak in front of a crowd. Originally he was like, \u201cCan we please just do private vows?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNope, I want to do them in front of everybody.\u201d So we are going to do them.",
      "I honestly don\u2019t think they will be that crazy or that amazing. They\u2019ll be pretty personalized, it\u2019ll probably be the way I would talk to him on a normal day.",
      "I think that\u2019s kind of the scary thing about success: It never feels like enough. Like everything after, if it\u2019s not quite up to par, you always feel like you didn\u2019t do as good a job, you know? Obviously in my head, I hope for success moving forward. But I also just hope to keep enjoying it. I love doing it, it\u2019s my total passion. It\u2019s my journal entries come to life. It\u2019s what my therapist told me to do to get regulated. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful that it\u2019s turned into something like this, and I just hope that I continue to love that and I continue to be able to connect with people.",
      "I remember saying to my therapist once at the beginning, \"What if I can\u2019t continue it? What if I can\u2019t maintain it?\" And she was like, \"Nobody can ever take away what\u2019s already happened.\" So I think that I get to move forward knowing that what\u2019s already happened is mine. Obviously I hope for more of it, but even if all I got was what I have, I would be so happy to have it."

      "It was a twist few viewers saw coming, and as she exited the villa, a few burning questions for her remained. In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, she comes with some answers.",
      "Charlie or Pepe? Where Hannah\u2019s Heart Lies",
      "The end of Hannah\u2019s journey on \u201cLove Island USA\u201d was a choice made by her fellow islanders. During Sunday\u2019s episode, the islanders were informed that America had been voting on their favorite guys and girls, as individuals. When the bottom three guys and bottom the girls were revealed, the rest of the villa had to choose two people \u2014 a guy and a girl \u2014 to dump. The girls eliminated Hannah, and the guys nixed Jeremiah.",
      "To many viewers, the islanders\u2019 selections were shocking moves. Jeremiah had been coming out of his shell after finding resolution in his hectic breakup with Huda. As for Hannah, she had just witnessed her first connection, Charlie, exit the villa in the same way and was finding a bit of happiness with a new guy, Pepe.",
      "Following her elimination, a pressing question remained: Does Hannah\u2019s heart lie with Pepe ... or with Charlie?",
      "\u201cMy heart is waiting for Pepe to get out of that villa,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI\u2019ve just been waiting and waiting to see if that\u2019s going to go anywhere. We had a really good talk before I left, and I\u2019ve just really been missing him.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come from this, and I don\u2019t know where his heart lies. I just know how I feel.\u201d",
      "Hannah also acknowledges her complicated feelings about Charlie, too: \u201cI think with Charlie as well, I don\u2019t know where his heart lies now. Obviously a lot has happened since he\u2019s left, and that can\u2019t be easy to witness.\u201d",
      "For now, she\u2019s acknowledges that the \u201creal world\u201d is much different than the villa, where around-the-clock proximity plays a big role.",
      "She adds, \u201cI think it\u2019s a waiting game to see where everything lies out and what really aligns for us, and see if we really work outside of the villa.\u201d",
      "Did Hannah Hope Pepe Would Leave With Her?",
      "Feelings are always heightened immediately following dumpings, and Hannah\u2019s was no exception. Was there any part of Hannah that thought Pepe might feel strongly enough to leave with her?",
      "\u201cHe had kind of mentioned it, but I just don\u2019t really think that it was an option,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cEven when Charlie left, I had thought about leaving. I think I had told Iris, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to go,\u2019 but I just don\u2019t think it was an actual option to leave. I don\u2019t really know exactly. Maybe it is.\u201d",
      "Despite her disappointment in leaving her connection behind in Fiji, Hannah holds no grudges against Pepe for staying.",
      "\u201cI kind of had told him, \u2018Don\u2019t ruin your experience.\u2019 I wanted him to have the best experience, and I don\u2019t hold it against him for not leaving at all, definitely. But you know I wish that he could have.\u201d",
      "Who Does Hannah See Winning \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "Despite the girls choosing to send her home, Hannah maintains that they will remain close.",
      "\u201cI think our sisterhood is really, really strong,\u201d Hanna tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think obviously there were moments where we\u2019d have little, you know, back-and-forth arguments \u2014 but honestly not really. There were only a couple notable ones and we really bounced back super fast from that.\u201d",
      "She mentions Huda, who had pursued Pepe briefly without being upfront with Hannah about it.",
      "\u201cI did have that falling out with Huda and we never really resolved that,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that would need to be resolved post-villa, but I\u2019m not closing myself off to any of them.\u201d",
      "Drama aside, Hannah maintains hope for her villa friendships and even has someone she\u2019s rooting to win.",

      "While Obama says she's \"not afraid\" of death, the goal is to put what she learned from her mother into action.",
      "\"With 25 more summers, I want to feel each one of them,\" she said. \"A day of nothing is one of those nice, slow days where you look up and go, 'Oh man, it's only noon.' I want more of those.\""

    "summary": "Actor Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas talks about Season 4 of \"The Bear,\" how her character, Tina, mirrors her own life and why fans will \"hurt\" and \"heal\" this season.",
    "story": [
      "The latest season of \"The Bear\" has dropped, and like its predecessors, it's riddled with highs, lows and plenty of heartbreak.",
      "\"The clock is ticking. Every second counts,\" Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas tells TODAY.com of Season 4, quoting the show's often-repeated mantra.",
      "Col\u00f3n-Zayas plays Tina Marrero on the hit Hulu series, who takes a line cook job at Chicago's Original Beef after being laid off from her longtime office job. When Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) takes over the restaurant, Tina is forced to either evolve or leave. She chooses the former, eventually becoming a sous chef at The Bear, finding a home in the found family that includes Carmy, Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and Natalie (Abby Elliott).",
      "Much like her character, Col\u00f3n-Zayas, too, has undergone her own transformation.",
      "\u201cThe struggles to get through the day has been really profoundly anxiety-producing for me as an actor,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I look at Tina\u2019s journey and I just get it.\u201d",
      "Born and raised in New York City, Col\u00f3n-Zayas pursued a stage career and found modest success in theater before transitioning to television, where she's played a variety of parts over a span of three decades, doggedly pursuing the break \"The Bear\" eventually delivered.",
      "The struggles to get through the day has been really profoundly anxiety-producing for me as an actor. And I look at Tina\u2019s journey and I just get it.\u201d",
      "Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas",
      "\"It's been a long struggle. It's been a lot of rejection. Hundreds of rejections. So, I understand Tina's resentment for these millennials that she feels are pushing her out. And she has very little to begin with and she's just trying to take care of her family,\" she says. \"I get it.\"",
      "Tina's combination of grit, independence and raw vulnerability has made her a fan-favorite character on the show. In 2024, Col\u00f3n-Zayas' performance won her an Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy, adding to the impressive collection of awards the show has picked up since premiering in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the writing, but it\u2019s also that vulnerability of opening up and saying, \u2018Here\u2019s all of this mess, all of this stuff that we have been programmed to hide and not express. Yet, we all work walking around with this stuff,\u2019\u201d Col\u00f3n-Zayas says.",
      "While the show has historically competed in the comedy category, \"The Bear\" is known for its emotional resonance with audiences, which Col\u00f3n-Zayas credits to the show's exploration of family.",
      "\"That is such a huge part of why The Bear family is together and is protecting each other. We all have these demons. I think this show resonates with so many people because they're like, 'Yeah, that was my family on Christmas. Yeah, that's me trying to find a job,'\" says Col\u00f3n-Zayas. \"So I'm grateful that these stories have been told because I think, I'm not the only one.\"",
      "Unpacking That 'Terrifying' Scene from Season 2",
      "Fans of \"The Bear\" will likely remember Col\u00f3n-Zayas singing karaoke in a bar full of people, most of them half her age, in Episode 5 of Season 2. Her emotional rendition of \"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\" was one of Tina's turning points in the series and something Col\u00f3n-Zayas says was completely \"terrifying.\"",
      "\"I'm from theater. I'm not from musical theater, so I don't sing,\" she explains, adding that the daunting scene was also filmed live.",
      "\"There's no auto-tuning going on. This sound is coming through these bar speakers. Like, it wasn't a pretty sound. There was no going back and redoing those scenes, singing in a smoother, prettier way,\" she says.",
      "The performance was not only a win for Col\u00f3n-Zayas, but also for her character, who, despite insecurity, stands up and allows herself to truly be seen. Col\u00f3n-Zayas says it represented her character \u201cpushing through that fear ... rather than just assuming that these people are going to shut me out.\"",
      "It's also a moment that marks Tina's willingness to be vulnerable, take risks and accept her place in The Bear's family.",
      "\"Those are the very same people who are embracing me and giving me a second chance,\" she says of her character's coworkers.",
      "It's not much different off screen, with Col\u00f3n-Zayas calling \"The Bear\" cast her \"kids,\" adding, \"They're so talented and fun.\"",
      "Paralleling Tina\u2019s journey, Col\u00f3n-Zayas says she's found her own second chance through the success of \u201cThe Bear.\u201d",
      "\u201cComing out on this side, I\u2019m a work in progress, but I am accepting that as long as I am proud of the work and doing the best I can, and protect my integrity, there are others around me that are noticing, who are respecting that, and who want that in the world,\" she says. \"And so I\u2019m just learning to rewire my brain.\u201d",
      "\u2018Doomsday Could be Coming\u2019 in Season 4",
      "Col\u00f3n-Zayas previewed Season 4, which dropped in full June 25, on TODAY with Jenna and Friends, saying, \u201cWe go much deeper in our own personal responsibility and reckoning.\u201d",
      "She also promised that \u201cof course,\u201d the season features the show\u2019s signature sense of heightened anxiety that comes from the fast-paced restaurant setting.",
      "\u201cDoomsday could be coming,\u201d she added.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Col\u00f3n-Zayas, avoiding spoilers for the newly released season, clarifies, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is (doomsday), because I\u2019m not saying that.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it is nerve-wracking at this point,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe all are just looking at what we\u2019re bringing.\u201d",
      "She says the season will force each character to examine what they bring to their found family.",
      "\u201cLike, what are each of us doing, individually and collectively, to this family that we\u2019ve made with the time that we have?\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll hurt again and it\u2019ll heal again,\u201d she adds."

      "\u201cThey asked me, \u2018What\u2019s your preferences?\u2019 So I just said, '45 to 60,' just being honest,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd then the process went and I was selected and then we had lunch with the executive producer.

      "In a recent interview with TODAY.com, the actor who plays Joe opened up about his character\u2019s emotional journey this season \u2014 from heartbreak to potential new beginnings \u2014 and what might lie ahead for Joe and Georgia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been rooting for Joe and Georgia for a long time as well,\u201d Ablack says.",
      "Joe and Georgia\u2019s connection has been a decades long slow burn. The two first met as teenagers in a flashback scene, when Joe showed Georgia an unexpected act of kindness during a difficult time in her life. Years later, they crossed paths again after Georgia moved to Wellsbury, Massachusetts, with her two children, Ginny (Brianne Howey) and Austin (Diesel La Torraca), and a troubled past she couldn\u2019t leave behind. Since then, their relationship has remained unresolved, marked by tension, bad timing and unspoken feelings that have kept viewers invested.",
      "Fans have watched Joe carry a torch for Georgia since Season 1. And while Georgia has been in and out of relationships, Ablack believes their timing might be right. The two finally get together in Season 3.",
      "\u201cHe confesses his feelings for her (again) because they haven\u2019t changed,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cThe timing is starting to become right for her.\u201d",
      "But, Ablack says, Georgia and Joe are not quite ready to get together. For one, Georgia is newly divorced from Paul (Scott Porter), the mayor. Then there are the legal troubles. She\u2019s currently on trial for the murder of Cynthia\u2019s (Sabrina Grdevich) husband and the Department of Child Services has temporarily removed her children, Ginny and Austin, from her custody. With so much unresolved, Joe and Georgia\u2019s future remains uncertain.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that they\u2019re together in perfect harmony just yet,\u201d Ablack says of the pair. \u201cGeorgia needs to take some time and give some attention to her kids who need her right now \u2026 so they understand each other, but they\u2019re not getting involved yet.\u201d",
      "Ablack thinks Joe is waiting for Georgia to be ready.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that Joe has any judgment for Georgia,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants her to feel any kind of shame \u2026 if she were ready today to be together romantically, I think he would be very open to it.\u201d",
      "The topic of timing comes up between Joe and Georgia this season. In one episode, Joe pointedly questions the timeline of Georgia\u2019s relationship with her ex, Paul. For example, in a tense scene, a drunk Paul reveals to Joe that he had been intimate with Georgia. Joe, clearly unsettled, repeatedly asks Paul when it happened, pressing for specifics.",
      "Ablack says Joe\u2019s reaction isn\u2019t about jealousy, but about seeking clarity.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s trying to understand when and how real their relationship could be,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cIf they had sex after Joe and Georgia had that conversation, it would hurt Joe\u2019s feelings a little bit.\u201d",
      "The season ends with a cliffhanger: Georgia is pregnant. With unresolved feelings for Joe and a recent relationship with Paul, it\u2019s unclear who the father is.",
      "When asked how Joe would feel if he were the father, Ablack says, \u201cI think he would love to be the father of Georgia\u2019s child. Joe is great with kids \u2026 he\u2019s a pushover and a teddy bear.\u201d",
      "Even if he\u2019s not the biological father, Ablack believes Joe would fully embrace a parental role.",
      "\u201cI think Ginny and Austin could bully him into getting whatever they want,\u201d Ablack says with a laugh. \u201cHe would enjoy being manipulated.\u201d",
      "The actor also predicts how Joe\u2019s growing relationship with Georgia might affect her kids.",
      "\u201cI think (Ginny) would be a cheerleader for the relationship,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cBut I have no idea how Austin will respond to a new relationship. I hope that Joe will still approach everyone with love and compassion.\u201d",

      "Palestinian flags waved amid the crowd at Glastonbury, England, on Saturday as several performers at one of Britain's biggest music festivals led the audience in chants criticizing Israel\u2019s continued military campaign in Gaza.",
      "The English punk duo Bob Vylan came under fire after it appeared to encourage tens of thousands of audience members to call for \u201cdeath\u201d to the Israel Defense Forces. Following chants of \u201cFree, free Palestine,\u201d singer Bobby Vylan appeared to switch to a different line: \u201cDeath, death to the IDF.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the river to the sea,\u201d Vylan could be seen saying on video shared across social media, \u201cPalestine must be, will be, inshallah, it will be free.\u201d",
      "Emily Eavis, a co-organizer of the Glastonbury Festival in southwestern England, said in a statement Sunday that the festival is \u201cappalled\u201d by Vylan\u2019s statements.",
      "\u201cTheir chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the Festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence,\u201d Eavis wrote.",
      "She wrote that the organizers stand against \u201call forms of war and terrorism\u201d and will always advocate for \u201chope, unity, peace and love.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith almost 4,000 performances at Glastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share,\u201d Eavis added, \u201cand a performer\u2019s presence here should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs.\u201d",
      "Criticism of Israel is growing louder around the world, with many in the U.K., the United States and elsewhere protesting Israel's campaign in Gaza, where the death toll has surpassed 55,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas carried out a terrorist attack on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage, according to an Israeli tally. Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response.",
      "The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory has also accused Israel of war crimes.",
      "Vylan, in a response shared on Instagram Sunday, wrote that he had received an influx of messages expressing both \"support and hatred\" while his daughter filled out a survey asking her opinions about school meals. He emphasized the importance of \"teaching children to speak up for the change they want and need.\"",
      "\"Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,\" Vylan wrote. \"Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organising online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.\"",
      "He captioned his post, \"I said what I said.\"",
      "As the backlash rolled in Saturday afternoon, the Avon and Somerset police were quick to announce on X that officers are assessing video evidence to \u201cdetermine whether any offences may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.\u201d",
      "The BBC, which aired the festival, also said some of Vylan\u2019s comments onstage were \u201cdeeply offensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cDuring this live stream on iPlayer, which reflected what was happening on stage, a warning was issued on screen about the very strong and discriminatory language,\u201d a spokesperson wrote in an email. \u201cWe have no plans to make the performance available on demand.\u201d",
      "And officials at the Israeli Embassy in the U.K. denounced the speech in a statement, saying it \u201ccrosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing.\u201d The embassy wrote that chants like \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d and \u201cFrom the river to the sea\u201d are phrases that \u201cadvocate for the dismantling of the State of Israel and implicitly call for the elimination of Jewish self-determination.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen such messages are delivered before tens of thousands of festivalgoers and met with applause, it raises serious concerns about the normalization of extremist language and the glorification of violence,\u201d the embassy wrote.",
      "The punk group wasn\u2019t the only act to land in hot water for its conduct at the festival. The Northern Irish rap trio Kneecap \u2014 which has stirred controversy before for its vocally pro-Palestinian views \u2014 also criticized Israel during its set while encouraging chants of \u201cFree, free Palestine.\u201d",
      "Last month, British authorities charged Kneecap rapper Mo Chara, whose real name is Liam O\u2019Hanna (or Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh), with a terrorism offense after he was accused of displaying the flag of the Hezbollah militant group. He appeared in court this month.",
      "On Saturday, the band appeared to kick off its set with a video compilation highlighting the terrorism charge and politicians who criticized Glastonbury\u2019s decision to allow it to play, according to clips that circulated online.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have to lecture you people. Israel are war criminals. It\u2019s a f-----g genocide,\u201d O\u2019Hanna told the crowd. He also called attention to the number of Palestinian flags in the audience, adding, \u201cThe BBC editors are gonna have some job.\u201d",
      "He then called on the crowd to join him in the chant, emphasizing the \u201cdifference it makes to people in Palestine when they see people from the other side of the world.\u201d",
      "The band also drew backlash this year when it included pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel messaging at Coachella, where it displayed a screen with the words: \u201cF--- Israel, Free Palestine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Irish not so long ago were persecuted at the hands of the Brits, but we were never bombed from the ... skies with nowhere to go,\u201d O\u2019Hanna said during the band\u2019s second weekend performance at Coachella. \u201cThe Palestinians have nowhere to go.\u201d"

      "Judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir posted on the office\u2019s official Mizan news agency website that those killed on Monday included staff, soldiers, prisoners and members of visiting families. It was not possible to independently verify the claim.",
      "The June 23 attack, the day before the ceasefire between Israel and Iran took hold, hit several prison buildings and prompted concerns from rights groups about the safety of the inmates.",
      "It remains unclear why Israel targeted the prison, but it came on a day when the Defense Ministry said it was attacking \u201cregime targets and government repression bodies in the heart of Tehran.\u201d",
      "The news of the prison attack was quickly overshadowed by an Iranian attack on a U.S. base in Qatar later that same day, which caused no casualties, and the announcement of the ceasefire.",
      "Jahangir did not break down the casualty figures but said the attack had hit the prison\u2019s infirmary, engineering building, judicial affairs and visitation hall, where visiting family members were killed and injured.",
      "On the day of the attack, New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran criticized Israel for striking the prison, seen as a symbol of the Iranian regime\u2019s repression of any opposition, saying it violated the principle of distinction between civilian and military targets.",
      "At the same time, the group said Iran was legally obligated to protect the prisoners held in Evin, and slammed authorities in Tehran for their \u201cfailure to evacuate, provide medical assistance or inform families\u201d following the attack.",
      "Jahangir said some of those injured were treated on site, while others were sent to hospitals.",

      "Israel attacked Iran on June 13 in a bid to destroy the country\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Over 12 days before a ceasefire was declared, Israel claimed it killed around 30 Iranian commanders and 11 nuclear scientists, while hitting eight nuclear-related facilities and more than 720 military infrastructure sites. More than 1,000 people were killed, including at least 417 civilians, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists group.",
      "In retaliation, Iran fired more than 550 ballistic missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted, but those that got through caused damage in many areas and killed 28 people.",

      "\u201cIt is clear that there has been severe damage, but it\u2019s not total damage, first of all. And secondly, Iran has the capacities there, industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Beijing has been stepping up controls on rare earth exports, triggering global shortages and exposing industries\u2019 dependence on Chinese supply chains.",
      "However, over recent years, China itself has become reliant on rare earth supplies from an unexpected source: the relatively small and war-torn economy of Myanmar.",

      "While China is the world\u2019s top producer of rare earths, it still imports raw materials containing the coveted metals from abroad.",
      "Myanmar accounted for about 57% of China\u2019s total rare earth imports last year, Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC.",
      "According to Chinese Customs data, Myanmar\u2019s rare earth exports to China significantly picked up in 2018 and reached a peak of nearly 42,000 metric tons by 2023.",
      "Baskaran added that the imports from Myanmar are also particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are generally less abundant in the earth\u2019s crust, elevating their value and scarcity.",
      "\u201cMyanmar\u2019s production has significantly strengthened China\u2019s dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain \u2014 and much of the leverage it wields today.\u201d",
      "The country has become a key source of two highly sought-after heavy rare earths, dysprosium and terbium, that play crucial roles in high-tech manufacturing, including in defense and the military, aerospace and renewables sectors.",
      "\u201cThis dynamic has given rise to a supply chain in which extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while downstream processing and value addition are predominantly carried out in China,\u201d said Baskaran.",
      "Why Myanmar?",
      "Myanmar is home to deposits that tend to have higher heavy rare earth content, David Merriman, research director at Project Blue, told CNBC.",
      "These \u201cionic adsorption clay,\u201d or IAC, deposits are exploited through leaching methods that apply chemical reagents to the clay \u2014 and that comes with high environmental costs.",
      "According to Merriman, the vast majority of the world\u2019s IAC operations were in Southern China in the early to mid-2010s. But, as Beijing began implementing new environmental controls and standards in the rare earths industry, many of these projects began to close down.",
      "\u201cMyanmar, particularly the north of the country, was seen as a key region which had similar geology to many of the IAC deposit areas within China,\u201d Merriman said.",
      "\u201cYou started to see quite a rapid buildout of new IAC-type mines within Myanmar, essentially replacing the domestic Chinese production. There was a lot of Chinese business involvement in the development of these new IAC projects.\u201d",
      "The rare earths extracted by these IAC miners in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of \u201crare earth oxides\u201d for further processing and refining, Yue Wang, a senior consultant of rare earths at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.",
      "In 2024, a report from Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on environmental and human rights abuses, said that China had effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar \u201cat a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s rare earth risks",
      "China\u2019s reliance on Myanmar for rare earths has also opened it up to supply chain risks, experts said.",
      "According to Global Witness\u2019s research, most of the heavy rare earths from Myanmar originate from the Northern Kachin State, which borders China. However, following Myanmar\u2019s violent military coup in 2021, the military junta has struggled to maintain control of the territory amid opposition from the public and armed groups.",
      "\u201cMyanmar is a risky jurisdiction to rely on, given the ongoing civil war. In 2024, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a group of armed rebels, seized sites responsible for half the world\u2019s heavy rare earths production,\u201d said CSIS\u2019 Baskaran.",
      "Since the seizure, there have been reports of supply disruptions causing spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. According to a Reuters report, the KIA was seeking to use the resources as leverage against Beijing.",
      "Chinese customs data shows imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar fell by over a third in the first five months of the year compared with the same period last year.",
      "\u201cIf Myanmar were to cease all exports of rare earth feed stocks to China, China would struggle to meet its demand for heavy rare earths in the short term,\u201d said Project Blue\u2019s Merriman.",
      "Not surprisingly, Beijing has been looking to diversify its sources of heavy rare earths.",
      "According to Merriman, there are IAC deposits in nearby countries, including Malaysia and Laos, where some projects have been set up with Chinese involvement.",
      "Still, he notes that environmental standards are expected to be higher in those countries, which will present challenges for rare earth miners.",
      "China\u2019s decision to cut back on its own extraction of heavy rare earth elements may serve as a warning to other countries about the costs of developing such projects. A report by Chinese media group Caixin in 2022 documented how former IAC operation sites in Southern China had left behind toxic water and contaminated soil, hurting local farmers\u2019 livelihoods."

      "\u201cSo there is no doubt in this moment, if you want, when it comes to the credibility of the U.S. as a partner, be it for a peace process, where we have signed a very important agreement today, or for investment from the U.S.,\u201d Wagner told the AP in an interview Friday evening.",
      "Analysts say the U.S. government\u2019s commitment might depend on how much access it has to the minerals being discussed under separate negotiations between the American and Congolese governments.",
      "The mostly untapped minerals are estimated to be worth as much as $24 trillion by the U.S. Department of Commerce.",
      "Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol, called the deal a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d but said it could \u201cin no way eliminate all the issues of the conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe current draft agreement ignores war crimes and justice for victims by imposing a partnership between the victim and the aggressor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis seems like a trigger-happy proposition and cannot establish lasting peace without justice and reparation.\u201d",
      "In Congo\u2019s North Kivu province, the hardest hit by the fighting, some believe that the peace deal will help resolve the violence but warn justice must still be served for an enduring peace.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the Americans should be trusted 100%,\u201d said Hope Muhinuka, an activist from the province. \u201cIt is up to us to capitalize on all we have now as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "The conflict can be traced to the aftermath of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, where Hutu militias killed between 500,000 and 1 million ethnic Tutsi, as well as moderate Hutus and Twa, Indigenous people. When Tutsi-led forces fought back, nearly 2 million Hutus crossed into Congo, fearing reprisals.",
      "Rwandan authorities have accused the Hutus who fled of participating in the genocide and alleged that elements of the Congolese army protected them. They have argued that the militias formed by a small fraction of the Hutus are a threat to Rwanda\u2019s Tutsi population.",
      "Since then, the ongoing conflict in east Congo has killed 6 million people, in attacks, famines and unchecked disease outbreaks stemming from the fighting."

    "summary": "The Yemeni island of Socotra was largely unspoiled, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense. Now it is threatened by climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting off the Horn of Africa, the Yemeni island of Socotra was largely left to its own devices for centuries, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense, the healing plant aloe and the crimson sap of the dragon\u2019s blood tree, used for dyes.",
      "Roughly the size of New York\u2019s Long Island, Socotra is about 140 miles off the coast of Somalia, a remote location that has allowed a unique ecosystem to flourish. It has a rich array of bird and animal life, and the coral reefs off its shores teem with colorful marine life. One-third of its 825 plant species cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, according to UNESCO.",
      "Some, including conservationist Kay Van Damme, have called it the Gal\u00e1pagos of the Indian Ocean and along with other experts, he is warning that millions of years of evolution on Socotra could be under \u201cserious threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cClimate change is by far the biggest threat to the island\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Van Damme, who has worked on Socotra for more than two decades, told NBC News in a call last month. \u201cIt is a relatively small island with a predominantly arid climate. Even small additional impacts from climate change can have an outsized effect, putting further pressure on fragile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "Prolonged droughts brought on by climate change are compounding damage from devastating cyclones in 2015 and 2018 that destroyed reefs, eroded soil and uprooted rare plants.",
      "The island\u2019s lifeblood, endemic species of frankincense trees, are also under threat. Four of the 11 recognized species on the island were classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in March.",
      "Five were recognized as endangered.\u201cTheir decline reflects the wider degradation of terrestrial habitats across the island and the ecosystems they support,\u201d said Van Damme, adding that overgrazing \u2014 predominantly from goats \u2014 is another significant challenge, leading to habitat degradation and \u201cleaving behind overmature trees with fewer younger trees to replace them.\u201d",
      "Tourism\u2019s growing footprint",
      "Attracted by Socotra\u2019s pristine beaches, turquoise waters and surreal flora, tourists are also placing mounting pressure on the island\u2019s fragile ecosystem.",
      "While there is only a handful of hotels, mostly in the capital Hadibo, a growing number of tour operators offer luxury camping and 4x4 tours around the island, some of which are packaged as ecotourism.",
      "Authorities have agreed to limit the number of tourists to around 4,500 per year, Ali Yahya, a local conservationist and tour operator, said in an interview last month, adding that when it came to \u201cvery sensitive areas in terms of ecosystems, biodiversity and cultural heritage, it\u2019s strictly not allowed to build any big buildings or large-scale hotels.\u201d",
      "But despite Socotra\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage designation \u2014 requiring preservation under international agreements \u2014 violations occur frequently, another local guide, Abdulraoof al-Gamhi, said in a series of voice and written messages last month.",
      "\u201cSome tourists build fires under dragon blood trees, carve inscriptions into rare trees, leave trash behind them and scare birds with their drones,\u201d he said. But he added that many of the island\u2019s residents benefit from tourism and that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for \u201ctour companies, car owners, drivers, restaurants, hotels and sellers of handcrafts.\u201d",
      "Echoing his concerns, Van Damme also said endangered species were \u201cbeing killed just for a selfie,\u201d with rare species like chameleons being captured so tourists can take pictures with them.",
      "Al-Gamhi also said he expected the number of tourists to rise as more people discover the unique locale, and \u201cthat will put a lot of pressure on our environment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be a big challenge,\u201d he added.",
      "A cautionary tale",
      "Although the Gal\u00e1pagos comparison is often used to celebrate Socotra\u2019s biodiversity, it can also serve as a warning, according to Van Damme, who co-authored a 2011 study on human impacts on the island.",
      "Since the 19th century, the Gal\u00e1pagos, remote islands some 600 miles off the coast of mainland Ecuador known for their unique flora and fauna, have lost numerous endemic species to habitat disruption, overtourism and invasive species.",
      "\u201cPerhaps Socotran ecosystems,\u201d Van Damme wrote at the time, \u201ccould now be considered as having at least, a similar state of health of those in the Gal\u00e1pagos at the time of [the Ecuadorian islands\u2019] nomination as world heritage site 30 years ago.\u201d He added that Socotra risked a similar fate without \u201ctimely conservation efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we consider the present-day condition in the Gal\u00e1pagos, we might catch a glimpse of Socotra\u2019s future, or better, what could happen if trends and threats continue in parallel,\u201d the paper added.",
      "That assessment \u201cturned out to be very predictive,\u201d particularly in terms of climate change, he told NBC News.",
      "The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands now host over 250,000 annual visitors, under strict controls including visitor caps, mandatory guides, designated trails and substantial tourism fees, which fund conservation.",
      "Socotra needs to implement similar protections before damage becomes irreversible, Van Damme said.",
      "Culture and tradition",
      "Beyond the environment, there are signs that tourism is also eroding the island\u2019s social fabric, according to Yahya, who said there was already a \u201ccultural shift\u201d among its 60,000 residents, many of whom remain deeply traditional and speak Soqotri, an ancient, unwritten language with pre-Islamic roots.",
      "\u201cInternational behaviors are influencing locals, and we worry about the erosion of our traditions,\u201d he said, adding that while tourists were welcome, some of them needed to be more respectful.",
      "An Instagram picture of a woman posing in a bikini beneath a dragon\u2019s blood tree had upset residents of one mountain village, he said, adding that it was seen as highly disrespectful by the conservative residents.",
      "Despite the pressures, there are reasons to be positive, Van Damme said, noting that authorities on the island are open to collaboration and local conservation projects are gaining traction.",
      "\u201cCommunity-led and other ongoing initiatives are vital,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they continue, there\u2019s genuine hope for the island\u2019s future.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientist was driving to his country house with his wife on an autumn day four years ago. As he slowed down for a speed bump, a remote-controlled machine gun mounted on a nearby pick-up truck fired a volley of bullets, killing him instantly, Iranian authorities said.",
      "The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the architect of a dormant nuclear weapons project known as Project Amad, illustrated in brutal fashion how deeply Israel had penetrated Iran. That vulnerability has only been exposed further in recent weeks, with Israeli air strikes killing several other scientists believed to be involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "Iran\u2019s political leaders now face a dilemma. After the heavy U.S. bombing of their nuclear sites and air defenses, they can strike a painful compromise with Washington and abandon their uranium enrichment program, or revive the secret weapons project masterminded by Fakhrizadeh.",
      "Unlike other countries that were able to develop nuclear weapons in secret, Iran cannot assume it will be able to keep its work hidden. Israel has demonstrated repeatedly it can evade Iran\u2019s security, uncover its clandestine nuclear activities and hunt down senior figures in the military, former intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s principal challenge in pursuing a covert pathway is going to be keeping it hidden from U.S. and Israeli detection,\u201d said Eric Brewer, a former intelligence official now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit focusing on global security.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the key challenge, because both countries, particularly Israel, have demonstrated an ability to penetrate Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd Israel has demonstrated an ability to use kinetic force to take it out.\u201d",
      "The Israeli air force has effectively wiped out Iran\u2019s air defenses. For the moment, Iran cannot protect any target on its territory -- especially suspected nuclear sites -- from a U.S. or Israeli bombing raid, former intelligence officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Israelis have complete intelligence dominance over Iran,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former career CIA officer and now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cIf they see something emanating as a threat, they will take it out. . .That could mean military strikes. It could be covert action.\u201d",
      "Iran has already tried once to build an atomic bomb under the veil of secrecy. It had a covert nuclear weapons project more than two decades ago, according to Western intelligence agencies.",
      "But its cover was blown in December 2002, when satellite photos emerged showing an enrichment site in the city of Natanz and a heavy water plant about 200 miles away in Arak.",
      "Iran has denied it ever had a weapons program. Archival documents stolen in 2018 by Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency, which the U.S. says are authentic, showed detailed plans to build five nuclear weapons.",
      "According to U.S. intelligence agencies, Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons project in 2003. At that point, the secrecy around the project had been breached and Iran had reason to be anxious in the wake of a U.S. invasion in neighboring Iraq.",
      "Since then, Iran maintained what it said was a civilian nuclear program. Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and other nuclear work gave Tehran the potential option to pursue an eventual weapon if it chose to go that route \u2013 what arms control experts call a \u201cthreshold\u201d nuclear capability.",
      "Stolen blueprints",
      "If the regime chooses to race towards a bomb, it will be calculating that nuclear weapons will discourage any adversary from trying to stage an attack or topple its leadership. And it would be following a familiar path taken by other countries that successfully pursued secret bomb projects, including North Korea, Pakistan, India and Israel.",
      "The Israeli government kept the Americans in the dark about their nuclear weapons project for years.",
      "In the 1950s, French engineers helped Israel build a nuclear reactor and a secret reprocessing plant to separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel. Israel\u2019s government to this day does not officially confirm or deny its nuclear arsenal, saying it will not be the first to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons in the Middle East.",
      "India\u2019s nuclear program also began in the 1950s, with the United States and Canada providing nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel for purely peaceful purposes. India agreed to safeguards designed to prevent the reactors and fuel from being used for weapons.",
      "But India secretly reprocessed spent fuel into plutonium in the 1960s, building up fissile material for a nuclear weapon. By 1974, India carried out its first nuclear test, code-named Smiling Buddha.",
      "Pakistan built its bomb with the help of nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, a metallurgist who stole blueprints and other information on advanced centrifuges while working at a nuclear engineering firm in Amsterdam. Khan later was linked with distributing nuclear weapons technology to Iran and North Korea among others.",
      "Khan\u2019s assistance in the 1990s proved crucial for North Korea\u2019s program. The Pyongyang regime also bought technology and hardware abroad through front companies or on the black market, according to U.N. monitors.",
      "It was America that helped Iran launch its nuclear program, before the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy. During the Shah\u2019s rule, through the U.S. \u201cAtoms for Peace Program,\u201d the United States provided nuclear technology, fuel, training and equipment to Iran in the 1960s, including a research reactor.",
      "Now Iran likely has no need to turn to outside partners for technical know-how, experts say. Still, the regime will have a daunting task reconstituting whatever is left of its nuclear program.",
      "Every known nuclear site in Iran was targeted in Israel\u2019s air campaign earlier this month. And then last week the U.S. launched an attack on three enrichment sites using 14 \u201cbunker buster\u201d 30,000-pound bombs and more than a dozen Tomahawk missiles. The CIA says key facilities were destroyed and the nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d in the strikes.",
      "Despite the unprecedented damage, which is still being assessed, it\u2019s possible Iran may have the technical means to relaunch a weapons program \u2013 including enriched uranium, centrifuges and access to tunnels or other underground sites, some arms control experts say.",
      "Iran\u2019s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium has yet to be accounted for, and it has an unknown number of centrifuges in storage that were not located at the sites bombed by Israel, NBC News has reported.",
      "Iran\u2019s most significant technical obstacle, however, could be producing uranium metal. Iran only had one known site where it could convert uranium into a solid metal state, and Israeli air strikes destroyed it in Isfahan.",
      "Iran would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon without such a facility, and it\u2019s unclear if the regime has a secret uranium metal product plant elsewhere.",
      "Technical hurdles aside, the decision whether to build a nuclear bomb ultimately will be shaped by political considerations rather than technology or logistics, according to Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.",
      "\u201cIt really is a political decision not a technical one,\" Lewis said. \"They still have a lot of capability left.\"",
      "After coming under a withering aerial assault that demonstrated Israel\u2019s air superiority, Iran may view nuclear weapons as the only way to defend itself and preserve the regime\u2019s survival, according to Marvin Weinbaum, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank and a professor at the University of Illinois.",
      "\u201cIran has every reason now, based on what\u2019s just happened, to say we\u2019ve got to have a bomb, [and] we\u2019ll be treated differently if we do,\u201d Weinbaum said.",
      "Officials in Iran\u2019s regime have long debated whether to develop nuclear weapons, and its policy over the past two decades appeared to strike a compromise, giving Tehran the option to go nuclear if circumstances required. The question for Iranian officials is whether nuclear weapons will help ensure the regime\u2019s survival or endanger its grip on power, regional analysts said.",
      "Looming over Iran\u2019s decision is the threat of Israeli espionage and air power, potentially catching Tehran in the act of rushing to produce a bomb.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting to see whether the regime buckles down and gets serious about it, or whether their operational security remains as terrible as ever,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey have been so careless.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff is due to hold talks on a possible agreement with Iran in coming days to try to halt its uranium enrichment in return for sanctions relief.",
      "Meanwhile, American and Israeli spy agencies \u201cwill be laser focused on trying to see what Iran is doing behind the scenes,\u201d Polymeropoulos said."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Young people in China may not be buying cars or  houses, but there\u2019s always money for milk tea and toys.",
      "It\u2019s a challenging time to be a young person in China: The world\u2019s second-biggest economy is growing far slower than it was when their parents were their age, with the U.S.-China trade war threatening to further weigh on growth. Competition for jobs is cutthroat and monthly youth unemployment stands at about 15% on average, with Chinese universities churning out a record 12.22 million new graduates this year.",
      "Feeling \u201cbesieged\u201d in life in the face of these economic obstacles, young Chinese consumers at home and abroad are finding comfort in smaller purchases.",
      "\u201cI spend to make myself happy,\u201d said Kitty Lu, a 23-year-old Chinese student in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cIt sounds a bit reckless, but I do have a number in my mind.\u201d",
      "Lu said most of her spending goes toward supporting celebrities she likes. Occasionally, she allows herself a \u201csmall indulgence\u201d in the form of \u201cblind box\u201d toys such as Disney dolls or the Labubu monster figurines that have become a global frenzy.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not that into these dolls,\u201d she said, adding that the purchase is more about having fun with friends as they open the blind box together to see which doll is inside.",
      "Lu\u2019s spending habits reflect a growing trend in recent years among young Chinese who show \u201clow interest\u201d in big purchases such as houses and cars but are embracing food and cultural products that offer \u201cinstant emotional gratification,\u201d according to the Fudan Development Institute, a Shanghai-based think tank.",
      "This phenomenon, also known as \u201cemotional consumption,\u201d has resulted in average annual growth of about 12% in industries including films and games since 2013, according to a report in March by the Chinese software and internet services company Kingsoft. The overall market for emotional consumption is projected to exceed $270 billion this year, the report said.",
      "Sweet drinks, low prices, happier life",
      "One of the biggest beneficiaries of Chinese consumer trends has been the country\u2019s beverage sector, which according to S&P Global is expected to grow up to 6% this year.",
      "Mixue, a bubble tea chain known for its cheap drinks, now has more stores worldwide \u2014 over 45,000, with nearly 10% of them outside mainland China \u2014 than any other food and beverage chain, including McDonald\u2019s, which has a global store count of 43,000, and Starbucks, with 38,000. In March, Mixue\u2019s shares jumped more than 40% on its market debut in Hong Kong.",
      "The brand\u2019s success stems largely from its low prices and rapid expansion, especially in less developed cities, as Chinese people adjust their spending habits while grappling with job security and other economic concerns.",
      "Kelsey Yu, 23, a graduate student in Beijing, said she bought a bottle of lemonade from Mixue for the equivalent of less than $1 on a visit in April to the southern Chinese city of Jieyang.",
      "\u201cThe drink quenched my thirst. It had a large portion and was cheap,\u201d she said, adding that Mixue\u2019s items are \u201cbetter value for money\u201d than those of many local competitors.",
      "Yu said that as a foodie, she drinks tea-based beverages at least once or twice a week and may \u201cindulge a bit more\u201d while traveling.",
      "\u201cI usually order milk tea when I\u2019m feeling tired or if I just want to have a good time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have self-control. So I won\u2019t have it every day.\u201d",
      "A complicated picture of Chinese consumption",
      "While U.S. officials often say Chinese consumers are not spending enough, the situation is not as clear-cut as it is portrayed, analysts said.",
      "In the past quarter-century, China\u2019s consumer spending has grown an average of 8% or more each year, one of the highest rates among major economies. But it has been outstripped by investment, making consumption a smaller part of China\u2019s overall GDP.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cSummer Davos\u201d event in Tianjin on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said China sought to become a \u201cmega-sized consumption powerhouse.\u201d",
      "Boosted by government subsidies, China\u2019s retail sales grew 6.4% in May, the fastest rate since late 2023.",
      "Sales during this year\u2019s monthlong 618 online shopping festival, which ended June 18, were a record 855.6 billion yuan ($119 billion), according to retail data provider Syntun, 15.2% higher than last year.",
      "Young Chinese in particular are \u201cliving frugally to spend big,\u201d according to state-backed research. Though they are budget-conscious when it comes to daily necessities, they \u201cdon\u2019t hesitate to splurge\u201d for their hobbies and happiness, it said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather spend 300 yuan ($42) on a great meal, and if the food is really good, I would think it\u2019s totally worth it,\u201d Yu said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a 300-yuan piece of clothing, I might hesitate.\u201d",
      "Amid China\u2019s economic challenges, middle-class consumers are less brand-conscious and prefer cheaper alternatives, said Yaling Jiang, founder of ApertureChina, a consulting firm that specializes in consumer research.",
      "\u201cNow saving is seen as cool, and seeking value is seen as cool,\u201d Jiang said. \u201cI think the downturn definitely changed the culture of spending.\u201d",
      "Chinese mallgoers these days spend money almost exclusively on the first and second floors, where food and beverage shops are concentrated, Jiang said.",
      "\u201cPeople are walking around the mall with a cup of milk tea or coffee,\u201d she added, looking at what\u2019s available in stores before going home to buy cheaper alternatives online.",
      "China\u2019s luxury market, which had accounted for almost a third of global sales, declined 18% to 20% last year, according to a January report by Bain and Company.",
      "\u201cI think there is less focus on the social status comparison, and more focus on what brings them personal happiness,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at ING, a post-pandemic change that has also been seen elsewhere.",
      "Consumers in China are both trading up and spending down, depending on the sector, said Shan Guo, a partner at Hutong Research, an investment advisory group based in Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey are not buying luxury bags, but they are buying Pop Mart,\u201d  Guo said, referring to the Chinese retailer behind the Labubu toys. \u201cLabubu can be quite expensive.\u201d",
      "Despite concerns about slower economic growth in China and elsewhere, Lu, the Melbourne student, said her friends are still \u201cquite willing to spend for fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not big spenders,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just happy to treat themselves when having a good time.\u201d"

      "Oslo police on Friday announced charges against Marius Borg H\u00f8iby, the eldest son of Norway\u2019s crown princess, on multiple counts including rape, sexual assault and bodily harm after a monthslong investigation of a case that involved a \u201cdouble-digit\u201d number of alleged victims.",
      "H\u00f8iby, the 28-year-old son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit and stepson of the heir to the throne, Crown Prince Haakon, has been under scrutiny since he was repeatedly arrested in 2024 amid allegations of rape and on preliminary charges of bodily harm and criminal damage.",
      "Oslo Police Attorney Andreas Kruszewski said that H\u00f8iby was cooperative during police questioning, which is now complete. Evidence in the case was drawn from sources including text messages, witness testimonies and police searches, the police attorney said.",
      "The charges included one case of rape involving intercourse and two cases of rape without intercourse, four cases of sexual assault and two cases of bodily harm, Kruszewksi said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cI cannot go into further detail about the number of victims in the case beyond confirming that it is a double-digit number,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense attorney Petar Sekulic, in an email to The Associated Press, said H\u00f8iby was \u201cabsolutely taking the accusations very seriously, but doesn\u2019t acknowledge any wrongdoing in most of the cases \u2014 especially the cases regarding sexual abuse and violence.\u201d",
      "The royal palace said \u201cthe case is proceeding through the legal system and is following normal procedures. We have nothing further to add.\u201d",

Hoiby has acknowledged cocaine use and addiction.",
      "Norway\u2019s future queen made headlines in 2001 when she married Haakon, because she was a single mother who had lived a freewheeling life with a companion who had been convicted on drug charges."

      "With Sudan in the grips of war and millions struggling to find enough to eat, many are turning to weeds and wild plants to quiet their pangs of hunger. They boil the plants in water with salt because, simply, there is nothing else.",
      "Grateful for the lifeline it offered, a 60-year-old retired school teacher penned a love poem about a plant called Khadija Koro. It was \u201ca balm for us that spread through the spaces of fear,\u201d he wrote, and kept him and many others from starving.",
      "A.H, who spoke on the condition his full name not be used, because he feared retribution from the warring parties for speaking to the press, is one of 24.6 million people in Sudan facing acute food insecurity \u2014nearly half the population, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. Aid workers say the war spiked market prices, limited aid delivery, and shrunk agricultural lands in a country that was once a breadbasket of the world.",
      "Sudan plunged into war in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary the Rapid Support Forces escalated to fighting in the capital Khartoum and spread across the country, killing over 20,000 people, displacing nearly 13 million people, and pushing many to the brink of famine in what aid workers deemed the world\u2019s largest hunger crisis.",
      "Food insecurity is especially bad in areas in the Kordofan region, the Nuba Mountains, and Darfur, where El Fasher and Zamzam camp are inaccessible to the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Mathilde Vu, an aid worker with the group based in Port Sudan. Some people survive on just one meal a day, which is mainly millet porridge. In North Darfur, some people even sucked on coal to ease their hunger.",
      "On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the Sudanese military leader Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and asked him for a week-long ceasefire in El Fasher to allow aid delivery. Burhan agreed to that request, according to an army statement, but it\u2019s unknown whether the RSF would agree to that truce.",
      "A.H. said aid distribution often provided slight relief. His wife in children live in Obeid and also struggle to secure enough food due to high prices in the market.",
      "His poem continued: \u201cYou were a world that sends love into the barren time. You were a woman woven from threads of the sun. You were the sandalwood and the jasmine and a revelation of green, glowing and longing.\u201d",
      "Fighting restricted travel, worsening food insecurity",
      "Sudanese agricultural minister Abu Bakr al-Bashari told Al-Hadath news channel in April that there are no indicators of famine in the country, but there is shortage of food supplies in areas controlled by the paramilitary forces, known as RSF.",
      "However, Leni Kinzli, World Food Programme Sudan spokesperson, said 17 areas in Gezeira, most of the Darfur region, and Khartoum, including Jebel Aulia are at risk of famine. Each month, over 4 million people receive assistance from the group, including 1.7 million in areas facing famine or at risk, Kinzli said.",
      "The state is suffering from two conflicts: one between the Rapid Support Forces and the army, and another with the People\u2019s Liberation Movement-North, who are fighting against the army and have ties with the RSF, making it nearly impossible to access food, clean water, or medicine.",
      "He can\u2019t travel to Obeid in North Kordofan to be with his family, as the Rapid Support Forces blocked roads. Violence and looting have made travel unsafe, forcing residents to stay in their neighborhoods, limiting their access to food, aid workers said.",
      "A.H. is supposed to get a retirement pension from the government, but the process is slow, so he doesn\u2019t have a steady income. He can only transfer around $35 weekly to his family out of temporary training jobs, which he says is not enough.",
      "Hassan, another South Kordofan resident in Kadugli said that the state has turned into a \u201clarge prison for innocent citizens\u201d due to the lack of food, water, shelter, income, and primary health services caused by the RSF siege.",
      "International and grassroots organizations in the area where he lives were banned by the local government, according to Hassan, who asked to be identified only by his first name in fear of retribution for speaking publicly while being based in an area often engulfed with fighting.",
      "So residents ate the plants out of desperation.",
      "\u201cYou would groan to give life an antidote when darkness appeared to us through the window of fear.,\u201d A.H. wrote in his poem. \u201cYou were the light, and when our tears filled up our in the eyes, you were the nectar.",
      "Food affordability",
      "Vu warned that food affordability is another ongoing challenge as prices rise in the markets. A physical cash shortage prompted the Norwegian Refugee Council to replace cash assistance with vouchers. Meanwhile, authorities monopolize some markets and essential foods such as corn, wheat flour, sugar and salt are only sold through security approvals, according to Hassan.",
      "Meanwhile, in southwest Sudan, residents of Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, rely on growing crops, but agricultural lands are shrinking due to fighting and lack of farming resources.",
      "Hawaa Hussein, a woman who has been displaced in El Serif camp since 2004, told the AP that they benefit from the rainy season but they\u2019re lacking essential farming resources such as seeds and tractors to grow beans, peanuts, sesame, wheat, and weika \u2014 dried powdered okra.",
      "Hussein, a grandmother living with eight family members, said her family receives a food parcel every two months, containing lentils, salt, oil, and biscuits. Sometimes she buys items from the market with the help of community leaders.",
      "\u201cThere are many families in the camp, mine alone has five children, and so aid is not enough for everyone \u2026 you also can\u2019t eat while your neighbor is hungry and in need,\u201d she said.",
      "El Serif camp is sheltering nearly 49,000 displaced people, the camp\u2019s civic leader Abdalrahman Idris told the AP. Since the war began in 2023, the camp has taken in over 5,000 new arrivals, with a recent surge coming from the greater Khartoum region, which is the Sudanese military said it took full control of in May.",
      "\u201cThe food that reaches the camp makes up only 5% of the total need. Some people need jobs and income. People now only eat two meals, and some people can\u2019t feed their children,\u201d he said.",
      "In North Darfur, south of El Fasher, lies Zamzam camp, one of the worst areas struck by famine and recent escalating violence. An aid worker with the Emergency Response Rooms previously based in the camp who asked not to be identified in fear of retribution for speaking with the press, told the AP that the recent wave of violence killed some and left others homeless.",
      "Barely anyone was able to afford food from the market as a pound of sugar costs 20,000 Sudanese pounds ($33) and a soap bar 10,000 Sudanese pounds ($17).",
      "The recent attacks in Zamzam worsened the humanitarian situation and he had to flee to a safer area. Some elderly men, pregnant women, and children have died of starvation and the lack of medical treatment, according to an aid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he\u2019s fearful of retribution for speaking publicly while living in an area controlled by one of the warring parties. He didn\u2019t provide the exact number of those deaths.",
      "He said the situation in Zamzam camp is dire\u2014\u201cas if people were on death row.\u201d",
      "Yet A.H. finished his poem with hope:",
      "\u201cWhen people clashed and death filled the city squares\u201d A.H. wrote \u201cyou, Koro, were a symbol of life and a title of loyalty.\u201d"

      "Palestinian witnesses say Israeli troops have opened fire at crowds on the roads heading toward the sites. Reacting to the Haaretz piece, Israel\u2019s military confirmed that it was investigating incidents in which civilians had been harmed while approaching the sites. It rejected the article\u2019s allegations \u201cof deliberate fire toward civilians.\u201d",

      "Palestinians trying to find food have frequently encountered chaos and violence on their way to and on arrival at the aid sites. Tens of thousands are desperate for food after Israel imposed a 2 1/2 month siege on Gaza, blocking all food, water and medicine from entering the territory pending the setup of the GHF sites.",

A GHF spokesperson challenged the report, saying they did not know of any incidents at or near their sites Friday.",
      "Twenty other bodies his hospital received Friday came from airstrikes across north Gaza, he said.",
      "Thousands of Palestinians walk for hours to reach the hubs, moving through Israeli military zones where witnesses say Israeli troops regularly open fire with heavy barrages to control the crowds. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots.",
      "Mohammad Fawzi, a displaced man from Rafah, told the AP that he was only able to get empty boxes, not food, from the aid site in the Shakoush area in Rafah when he trekked there early Thursday morning."
